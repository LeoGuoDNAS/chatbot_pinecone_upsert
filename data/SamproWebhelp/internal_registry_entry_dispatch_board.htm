<P class="Support_Heading_1" >Internal Registry Dispatch Board Notes</P>
 <P class="See_Also" >Important Notice: this help topic is intended for use by Authorized Data-Basics Support Personnel only.  Incorrect implementation of the information discussed below can create problems with software functionality and/or data. </P>
 <P class="Support_Heading_2" >1. Overview</P>
 <P class="Support" >The ‘Classic’ Board view lets users switch between the original Data-Basics board (Power Board) and a simplified (Classic/Day) version that is similar to the boards implemented in other software.  </P>
 <P class="Support" ><FONT style="font-weight:bold; " >Colors:</FONT></P>
 <P class="Support" >Version 6 and later also changes the way that work orders on the Dispatch Board are color-coded. Version 5.1 (and earlier) used a combination of status, priority and time (due, past due) to set the colors.  These schemes had inherent flaws, and seem to confuse more users that they helped.  Likewise, the Version 5.1 registry entry sys-dispatchboard-colors registry entry (now obsolete) that was implemented to set colors by priority only also had its problems. </P>
 <P class="Support" >The solution to the above issues is a new registry entry, sys-dispatchboard-colors-powerboard.  This entry <FONT style="font-weight:bold; " >must</FONT> be created for any color-coding at all to be implemented on the lower half of the dispatch board (regardless of whether the Power Board or Classic Board is displayed above). As discussed below, this registry entry enables color-coding by a single work order field, such as Zone, Priority, or Status. These names must be the same as the column headings on the Work Order list (e.g, Priority would be entered as Pr). </P>
 <P class="Support" ><FONT style="font-weight:bold; " >Classic Board and Day Board:</FONT></P>
 <P class="Support" >If you make no new registry entries, the upper section of the Classic and Day Boards will function with the default settings built into the system (and the various sys-dispatchboard-colors registry entries). If want to make any changes to the Classic Board (or Day board that you get by switching the orientation) you will have to make all the registry entry options correctly or risk many lovely error messages.  For this reason, you should probably script in these entries as needed.  These configuration registry entry descriptions will <FONT style="font-weight:bold; " >not</FONT> be included in the customer’s version of the Help files as they are too problematic for users to play with.  A reference will be made in the Release Notes to the fact that the Classic and Day Board configuration can be adjusted – please contact your support rep for details. </P>
 <P class="Support" >Color-coding by more than one field is supported for both the Classic and Day boards; this is discussed in the links to Customer Help. Additional options in the sys-viewer-vdsptchbrd registry entry are also needed if you wish to reset the Classic and Hours Board Row and Column header sizes. </P>
 <P class="Support" style="margin-left:36.00pt;border-top:0.50pt solid black;border-bottom:0.50pt solid black;border-left:0.50pt solid black;border-right:0.50pt solid black;"><FONT style="font-weight:bold; " >Testing Your Registry Entries<BR></FONT>The system does not verify the validity of registry entries. Be sure to test your registry entries after completing them to verify that they are functioning correctly.  You will need to close and reopen the Dispatch Board to see your registry entries take effect.  </P>
