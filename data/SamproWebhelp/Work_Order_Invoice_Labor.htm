<h1>Work Order Labor Tab</h1>
<h2>Purpose:</h2>
<p>Specifies the time, rate, and type of labor.</p>
<h2>Example:</h2>
<p>2 hours overtime for a plumber, 1.5 hours regular time for an electrician.</p>
<h2>Usage:</h2>
<p>Labor may either be entered on this screen, in the Labor Journal, in 
 WO Entry or remotely. Note that imported lines may not be copied (using 
 the Insert button’s Insert/Copy functionality).</p>
<p>The system warns the user when entering time for a terminated employee; 
 the Date Terminated (from the Employee record) is included in the warning.</p>
<h3><font style="font-weight: bold;">Prevailing Wages</font></h3>
<p style="margin-left: 36.00pt;">If the Cost Code is set to Field, Prevailing 
 Wages/Costs will be in effect (if the Employee is attached to the prevailing 
 wage job). If the Cost Code is set to Office, cost and wage information 
 will be pulled from the Employee record.</p>
<h3>Validations on Quoted Lines</h3>
<p style="margin-left: 48px;">Previously, 
 entering a labor budget on the Labor Tab by checking lines as &#39;quoted&#39;, 
 resulted in the quoted line posting to GL when the WO was marked as Invoice 
 Ready. In Version 9.1 the system never posts to GL for quote-type 
 WO Labor lines.</p>
<p style="margin-left: 48px;"><span style="text-indent: 30.25pt;">A</span>ll 
 changes to lines generated from Quote Master are denied if the option 
 DenyChangesToQuoteMasterLines is enabled in the sys-viewer-vwrkordr registry.</p>
<p style="margin-left: 36.00pt;">If the WO is NOT associated with a Quote, 
 Date / Payroll Period validation occurs on quoted lines if the Payroll 
 Period is filled in.</p>
<p style="margin-left: 36.00pt;">Validation is applied to lines that are 
 <font style="text-decoration: underline; ">not</font> associated with 
 a Quote to prevent an &#39;actual&#39; line (that has already been saved into 
 the database) from being switched to a Quote-type line.</p>
<p style="margin-left: 36.00pt;">The Quote box of Work Orders associated 
 with a Quote cannot be changed.</p>
<h3>Validations for Payroll and Accounting Periods</h3>
<p>Delete Line and Insert Line <span style="text-decoration: underline; ">with</span> 
 Copy are denied if the lines is not quoted and:</p>
<p style="margin-left: 48px;">The Payroll Period is Inactive<br/>
The Payroll Period&#39;s Accounting Period is Inactive and the Effective Date 
 is in the Accounting Period<br/>
The Payroll Period&#39;s Accrual Period is Inactive and the Effective Date 
 is in the Accrual Period</p>
<p style="margin-left: 8px;">Changes to actual hours are allowed if the 
 applicable Payroll / Accounting / Accrual periods are active for the Work 
 Date and the Technician has not been paid.  Changes to Billable Hours 
 and revenue-related fields are allowed if the line has not been invoiced.</p>
<p style="margin-left: 8px;">Validation 
 prevents changing the Payroll Period on an existing Labor line from one 
 that has Accrue to GL enabled to one with Accrual to GL disabled and vice 
 versa.</p>
<h3>Validations after Computing Payroll</h3>
<p>The software restricts edits to work order labor lines that have been 
 computed or computed and paid:</p>
<p style="margin-left: 23.75pt;">- Lines that have been computed AND paid 
 can&#39;t be deleted or copied. The Hours (actual), Effective Date, Payroll 
 Period and Technician fields cannot be changed.</p>
<p style="margin-left: 23.75pt;">Lines that have been computed but NOT 
 paid can be changed deleted and copied.  However, when this 
 happens, Compute Payroll must be rerun, and the user will be alerted. 
 Validation ensures that a check can&#39;t be printed without recomputing.</p>

<h2>Important Fields:</h2>
<p><font style="font-weight: bold;">Tab Header -</font> <font style="font-weight: bold;">Actual 
 H</font><font style="font-weight: bold;">ours</font><font style="font-weight: bold;">:</font> 
 <font style="font-weight: bold;">Billable</font> <font style="font-weight: bold;">Hours</font><font style="font-weight: bold;">:</font> <font style="font-weight: bold;"><br/>
</font>These display-only fields are maintained by the system to list a 
 running total of the hours entered on the Work Order.</p>
<p><img src="assets/images/image/Magnify.gif" alt="" style="border: none;" border="0"/> 
 Double-click the Magnify button to display all fields for this line.</p>
<p class="Reference_Line" style="margin-bottom: 0.00pt;"><img src="assets/images/image/LinesView.gif" alt="" style="border: none;" border="0"/>  Click the Lines View 
 button to display the multiple line view again.</p>
<p><font style="font-weight: bold;">Qu (Quote?)<br/>
</font>Normally, this box will be checked if this line was imported from 
 the Quotemaster wizard approval process. Quoted lines are used by the 
 system to 1) bill out revenue and 2) create a budgeted cost for the quote, 
 so that reports can compare the actual and budgeted cost of the quote. 
 <font style="font-weight: bold;">Lines generated by Quotemaster should 
 NEVER have the Quote box cleared.</font> Billable revenue should only 
 be included/revised on these lines if it represents additional billable 
 dollars not included in the original quote.</p>
<p>As the work for this quote is completed, the actual hours should be 
 recorded on lines that are not flagged as Quotes: these costs will be 
 written to Job History.</p>
<p style="margin-left: 36.00pt;"><font style="font-weight: bold;">PM Work 
 Orders – JCH Budgets<br/>
</font>This <a href="Registry_Entry_to_Warn_if_Cost_Code_Requires_Certified_PR_Reporting.htm#registry_workorder_disable_budget_posting">registry 
 option</a> will disable the posting of job history of budget cost and 
 budget revenue for Preventive Maintenance work orders where the work order 
 lines are marked QU.</p>
<p><font style="font-weight: bold;">Extra?</font><br/>
If these hours are an &quot;extra&quot; (not explicitly included in a contract), 
 check this box (by double-clicking or pressing the Spacebar). If these 
 hours are being entered for a Billing Item that is tagged as Fixed Fee 
 AND Allow Extras, flagging this field will result in the system defaulting 
 in a Revenue amount. If these hours are being entered for a Billing Item 
 that is tagged as Fixed Fee AND Allow Extras, clearing this field will 
 result in the system zeroing the Revenue amount.</p>
<p><font style="font-weight: bold;">Start</font> <font style="font-weight: bold;">Time 
 :</font> <font style="font-weight: bold;">End Time</font><font style="font-weight: bold;">: 
 (Custom Fields)</font> <font style="font-weight: bold;"><br/>
</font>If you would like to be able to access these fields for entering 
 and recording employee data, please contact your support representative: 
 a customization file will be needed to display these fields. The following 
 validations will be performed on these fields:</p>
<p>1. Start Time can&#39;t exceed End Time unless End Time is empty.<br/>
2. End Time can&#39;t precede Start Time.<br/>
3. Time must be entered in military (24-hour) format.</p>
<p>Changes to either the Start or End times triggers a computation of the 
 Hours. </p>
<p><font style="font-weight: bold;">Hours Hrs Billable<br/>
</font>Hours (Actual) and Billable Hours may be specified separately. Hours 
 will be used for costing, while Hours Billable will be used to compute 
 revenue for billing purposes. Note that the Hrs Bill field defaults when 
 you enter Hours, but may be adjusted by the user. This enables you to 
 enter a single line of labor to account for a situation where a technician 
 spent three hours on a job (for costing purposes), but you only wished 
 to bill the customer for 2 hours.</p>
<p>If the Hours (Actual) is zero, the system does not validate that the 
 effective date falls within the Pay Period date range.</p>
<p><font style="font-weight: bold;">Effective Date:<br/>
</font> Enter the date worked in <font style="font-style: italic;">mmddyyyy</font> 
 format or double-click on this field to access the calendar. This field 
 is required for the system to use the Rate Schedule in the Job Record 
 to fill in the Revenue Rate correctly. If the Effective Date is not filled 
 in, the Revenue Rate will default from the Labor Rate record.</p>
<p>Payroll Period validation (for a closed Accrual / Accounting Period) 
 occurs when the Date is entered (if a Payroll Period defaulted) or when 
 the Payroll Period is entered (if it was not defaulted).</p>
<p style="margin-left: 48px;"><span style="font-weight: bold;">Lines 
 from Quote Master:</span> When the Work Order is set to Invoice Ready 
 and saved, the Effective Date of Quoted lines and Revenue Adjustments 
 from Quote Manager will be updated to the Work Order Date Work Completed 
 (if set). In previous releases, the Effective Date of these lines was 
 set to the origination date of the Quote. Since this date could be months 
 in the past, revenue was recognized way too early through the Job EOM 
 function. See <a href="Quoted_and_Rev_Adjustment_Line_Dates.htm">Quote 
 and Rev Adjust Lines</a> for details.</p>
<p><font style="font-weight: bold;">Equipment Id:</font><br/>
The Equipment these labor hours should be applied to. If only one piece 
 of equipment appears on the Equipment tab, this field will default. If 
 multiple Id’s are listed on the Equipment tab, you must enter a valid 
 Id to or double-click to select from a list (only Id&#39;s on the Equipment 
 tab will appear on the list).</p>
<p><font style="font-weight: bold;">Technician Id:</font><br/>
The technician that worked these hours. This field automatically defaults 
 from the first line of the Technician tab but may be changed by the user 
 if needed. Double-click on this field to select from a list of Id&#39;s. The 
 system will warn you if you enter an inactive technician.</p>
<p><font style="font-weight: bold;">Description:</font><br/>
This optional field may be used to briefly describe this time card entry.</p>
<p><font style="font-weight: bold;">Cost Category:</font><br/>
When you double-click on this field, the list will be filtered so that 
 only those Job Cost Categories with a cost type of Labor will be displayed. 
 This field is required.</p>
<p style="margin-left: 36.00pt;"><font style="font-weight: bold;">Note:</font> 
 If edits are made to work order detail lines AFTER a change has been made 
 to the Posting Type of the Cost Category, updates to JCH will use the 
 <font style="text-decoration: underline; ">original Cost Type</font>.  For 
 example, if a cost type was changed from Labor to Other, the changed amounts 
 continue to be classified as Labor.</p>
<p style="margin-left: 8px;">This field 
 supports enhanced filtering provided by the Cost Code&#39;s Job Cost Category 
 Usage Filter. Cost Categories are validated (relative to Cost Codes) during 
 data entry upon leaving the Cost Category Id field.  The full relationship 
 is validated again when leaving a child line or saving a record.</p>
<p><font style="font-weight: bold;">Pay Period Id:</font><br/>
Enter the Id of the appropriate Pay Period, or double click on this field 
 (or press Alt+F7) to select from a list. This field is required if Payroll 
 is implemented on your system.</p>
<p><font style="font-weight: bold;">Pay Type Id:</font></p>
<p class="Reference_Line" style="margin-bottom: 0.00pt;">The system will 
 default this field according to the following rules:</p>
<p style="margin-left: 23.75pt;"><font style="font-family: Symbol;" face="Symbol">-</font> 
 The Job record Prevailing Wages Tab first</p>
<p style="text-indent: 18.00pt;"><font style="font-family: Symbol;" face="Symbol">-</font> 
 Then the Pay Type in the Technician Record</p>
<p style="margin-left: 23.75pt;"><font style="font-family: Symbol;" face="Symbol">-</font> 
 Finally the Pay Type Id in the Employee record.</p>
<p>However, if a Pay Type is specified in the Job Cost Category you selected, 
 it will override the one entered in the Technician or Job (Prevailing 
 Wages) record. This field can be changed if overtime hours (or other types 
 of hours) are being recorded. You may double-click to select from a list 
 of Id&#39;s.</p>
<p><font style="font-weight: bold;">Labor Rate Id:</font><br/>
The system will default this field according to the following rules:</p>
<p style="margin-left: 23.75pt;"><font style="font-family: Symbol;" face="Symbol">-</font> 
 The Job record Employee Overrides Tab first</p>
<p style="margin-left: 23.75pt;"><font style="font-family: Symbol;" face="Symbol">-</font> 
 Then the Labor Rate in the Technician Record (for Field type Cost Codes)</p>
<p style="margin-left: 23.75pt;"><font style="font-family: Symbol;" face="Symbol">-</font> 
 Finally the Labor Rate Id in the Employee record (for Office type Cost 
 Codes)</p>
<p style="margin-left: 36.00pt;"><font style="font-weight: bold;">Note: 
 Prevailing Wages Jobs</font> <font style="font-weight: bold;">– Employee 
 Overrides</font><br/>
If you are entering time for a Prevailing Wages Job, the values found in 
 the Employee Overrides tab of the Job record will override the default 
 employee Labor Rate and Pay Type. These overrides will only be implemented 
 when the cost code type is set to field for the journal entry.</p>
<p style="margin-left: 36.00pt;"><font style="font-weight: bold;">Registry 
 Setting: Office/Field Determined by Job Cost Code<br/>
</font>An option of the sys-ffv-global-settings registry entry (<a href="Registry_Entry_Global_Settings__Column_Compression__Dispatch_Board_Rows__History_Log_Inventory_Markup.htm">Registry 
 Entry Global Settings</a> ) enables the system to determine whether hours 
 should be considered &#39;office&#39; or &#39;field&#39; depending on the Job Cost Code&#39;s 
 Work Type setting. If this option is implemented, hours charged to a &#39;Field&#39; 
 Job Cost Code will be considered field hours, regardless of whether the 
 employee is Office or Field.</p>
<p><font style="font-weight: bold;">Flat Rate Id:<br/>
</font> If this line was created by the system when a Flat Rate was imported, 
 this field will be filled in.</p>
<p><font style="font-weight: bold;">Bill Type Id: Revenue Rate</font><br/>
These fields determine how the Unit Price of <font style="font-weight: bold;">labor 
 flagged as Extras</font> will be calculated. Both of these fields default 
 from the Job Record&#39;s Rate Schedule.</p>
<p style="margin-left: 36.00pt;">In most cases, <font style="font-weight: bold;">Unit 
 Price</font> will be selected for Labor entries. The system will use the 
 Rate specified in the appropriate Labor Rate Table to default the Revenue 
 Rate in this tab.</p>
<p style="margin-left: 72.00pt;"><font style="font-weight: bold;">Note 
 on Entering Labor Lines</font> <font style="font-weight: bold;">with a 
 Billing Rate Type of n/a</font><font style="font-weight: bold;">:<br/>
</font>If the billing type is n/a, the system will not calculate the Amount 
 Revenue, even if the Revenue Rate is completed! Typically, you would leave 
 the Revenue Rate field blank, and enter the Amount Revenue field directly 
 when billing for labor. Note that if you edit a labor line, selecting 
 a labor rate with a Billing Type of n/a, the Amount Revenue on the labor 
 line will NOT be changed.</p>
<p><font style="font-weight: bold;">Unit Price:  Amount Revenue:</font><br/>
The system calculates the Unit Price based on the Revenue Rate (in the 
 Rate Schedule if an Effective Date has been entered, or the Technician 
 Record if the Effective Date was not filled in) and Bill Type Id <font style="font-weight: bold;">unless</font> the Bill Type is n/a (see 
 above). The system calculates the Amount Revenue as the Unit Price X Hours. 
 Either of this fields may be changed by the user; the system will recalculate 
 the other.</p>
<p><font style="font-weight: bold;">Job Id:</font><br/>
The Id of Job these hours are being entered against. This field defaults 
 from the job on the main screen of the Work Order unless a registry setting 
 is in place to default the Job from the Equipment record. This field is 
 required for job costing.</p>
<p><font style="font-weight: bold;">Job Cost Code Id: Job Billing Item 
 Id:</font><br/>
Enter the appropriate Id&#39;s for this Job or double-click to select from 
 a list.</p>
<p><font style="font-weight: bold;">GL Entity Id:</font><br/>
This field defaults from the Job record but may be changed by the user. 
 When Intercompany is enabled and a detail 
 line contains a Job Id, any changes to the line&#39;s GL Entity are validated 
 to ensure that the new GL Entity belongs to the same company as the Job. 
 It identifies the profit center to be charged with these hours. You may 
 double-click to select from a list of Id&#39;s. This field is optional for 
 Payroll.</p>
<p><font style="font-weight: bold;">Earnings Group Id:</font><br/>
If this employee is a member of an Earnings Group (typically, a Union member), 
 this field defaults from the Employee record and will be used to control 
 earnings calculations for payroll. If this field is empty (typically, 
 non-Union employees), the earnings detail on the ERN tab of the Employee 
 record will be used to control earnings calculations for payroll. Note 
 that if you blank out the Earnings Group Id, and the ERN tab is blank, 
 the employee will not be paid for these hours.</p>
<p><font style="font-weight: bold;">Deduction Group Id:</font><br/>
If this employee is a member of an Deduction Group (typically, a Union 
 member), this field defaults from the Employee record and will be used 
 to calculate payroll deductions. In addition to the deductions specified 
 in the Deduction Group, the deductions specified on the DED tab of the 
 Employee record will <font style="font-weight: bold; font-style: italic;">also</font> 
 be applicable. If this field is empty (typically, non-Union employees), 
 only the deduction detail on the DED tab of the Employee record will be 
 used.</p>
<p><font style="font-weight: bold;">WC Category:<br/>
</font> The system looks at the job cost category to see if it has any 
 WC’s attached, and it so, chooses the one for the WC State in the Job 
 record to override the Employee WC.  Otherwise, the Workers 
 Compensation field defaults from the Employee record; it is required if 
 Payroll is implemented on your system.</p>
<p><font style="font-weight: bold;">State Tax Authority:  Local Tax 
 Authority:  Other Tax Authority:<br/>
</font> These fields required if Payroll is implemented on your system. 
 If this timecard entry is for an Office employee, these fields default 
 from the Employee record. If this timecard entry is for a Field employee, 
 these fields default from the Job record. They should reflect the physical 
 location of the employee when he worked these hours for Payroll Tax calculations. 
 You may double-click these fields to select from a list of Tax Authorities.</p>
<p><img src="assets/images/image/Magnify.gif" alt="image\Magnify.gif" title="image\Magnify.gif" width="18" height="18" border="0"/>  Click the Magnify button 
 to display the following fields:</p>
<p><font style="font-weight: bold;">Tax Type Id</font><font style="font-weight: bold;">:<br/>
</font>SAMPro automatically assesses the correct Tax Type for this field 
 based on the Job’s Tax Type and Tax Group. There may be situations, however, 
 where the rules are such that labor that is normally sales taxable should 
 not be subject to sales tax in this case. To handle this, the Tax Type 
 Id should be set to n/a. This field includes validation to deny the user 
 the ability to make illegal selections – such as ‘exempt’ for a sales 
 tax job.</p>
<p><font style="font-weight: bold;">Imported From JCH:<br/>
</font>This box will be checked if this line was imported from Job Cost 
 History (e.g., the Labor Journal) rather than being entered directly on 
 the work order. Note that imported lines may not be copied (using the 
 Insert button’s Insert/Copy functionality).</p>
<p><font style="font-weight: bold;">Computed:<br/>
</font>This display-only field is maintained by the system.</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: bold;">TechAnywhere 
 Source Rn: Technician Id:</span><br/>
If these fields are completed, this record/line was created/revised from 
 TechAnywhere.</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: bold;">Start 
 Time:  Stop Time:</span><br/>
These fields would typically be completed if this time was originally entered 
 via TechAnywhere. Note that changes made to these fields may impact the 
 actual Hours field.</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: bold;">Supervisor 
 Id:</span><br/>
If completed, this field specifies the Supervisor responsible for the work 
 in this entry.  </p>
