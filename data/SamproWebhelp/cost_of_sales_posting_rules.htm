 <P class="Support_Heading_2" >LABOR</P>
 <P class="support" >If PR Period has the &quot;accrue&quot; option selected, then DR to Paytype Expense account and CR to accrued payroll account is made effective @ labor line entry.&nbsp; This is done whether labor is entered in Labor Journal -or- WO Lab Tab.&nbsp; A Line ORIGINALLY entered in the Labor journal that are <FONT style="font-style:italic; " >imported </FONT>to the WO LAB tab would have posted when entered in LJ, and do not post again from WO Labor tab.&nbsp; If &quot;accrue&quot; is not selected in PR PERIOD, then no g/l is performed until POSTING PR Checks through the PR system and all expense is effective on the CHECK Date.</P>
 <P class="Support_Heading_2" ><BR>INVENTORY</P>
 <P class="support" >Inventory Items refer to an INVENTORY GROUP.&nbsp; Inventory Groups have a designation for an INVENTORY ACCOUNT &amp; EXPENSE account.&nbsp; Theoretically each group <FONT style="font-style:italic; " >could </FONT>refer to different accounts.&nbsp; This is helpful for expensing equipment to an &quot;Equipment&quot; COS account, and lesser items to a &quot;Materials&quot; COS account, though I don't think most of our clients break the Asset account out.&nbsp; IF WO Inventory to GL is selected in the Accounting Periods...then when a line is added to the WO Inventory Tab there is a DR to the Expense and a CR to the Inventory Account specified in the INV Group associated with the Item.&nbsp; THIS APPLIES ONLY to inventory ADDED to the Work Order....g/l for from items referenced and imported from Purchase orders is handled by purchasing and&nbsp; AP logic.</P>
 <P class="Support_Heading_2" ><BR>OTHER</P>
 <P class="support" >Items entered directly on the OTHER tab have no interaction w/ g/l as it relates to expense...items originating from PO's end up here but the g/l activity associated with that is handled via purchasing and APJ activity.&nbsp; If this tab is being used to assign REFRIGERANT RECOVERY for example and you desire some interaction with a COS account every time that function is performed, then it might be better to create in inventory group and part record to enable that activity to flow through the inventory tab.&nbsp; Otherwise items entered here are to get revenue assigned, without necessary affecting COS Expense.&nbsp; TRIP CHARGE for example.</P>
 <P class="Support_Heading_2" ><BR>ITEM IMPORTED FROM PURCHASE ORDERS (INV &amp; OTH) TAB</P>
 <P class="support" >No direct G/L activity occurs when these lines are imported to the wo...all posting of g/l is handled when the PO's are vouchered in APJ.<BR><BR>In the PO on the INV tab there is a qty. and a job qty. expense will be recognized for these item upon vouchering the AP Invoice.<BR>The JOB QTY &amp; UNIT COST will get posted to the Expense in the INV GROUP, the difference between QTY &amp; JOB QTY (if there is one) will go to the inventory account from the INV GROUP...<BR><BR>For GEN tab items, posting will happen upon vouchering to the account specified in ap journal, which defaults from the PO Expense account, which populated with the Cost Category Expense account when it was entered on the PO.</P>
