<H1>Version 7.3 Release Notes 7.3.498.097</H1>
 <P>Click  <A href="version_7_3_release_notes.htm#73_recent_updates">7.3 Recent Updates and Enhancements</A> for a brief synopsis of recent changes to this version (see page 107 of the printed notes, or jump to page 121 in the Adobe .pdf reader). </P>
 <H1>1 System</H1>
 <P><FONT style="font-weight:bold; " >Important Installation Note</FONT><FONT style="font-weight:bold; " >:</FONT> The zip file for this release<FONT style="font-weight:bold; " > </FONT>includes a file containing all bitmap definitions in the image (master~pushbuttons.obj) and an executable image (v.exe) stripped of all bitmaps. The bitmaps will be loaded when a user logs on from the master~pushbuttons.obj file and the SKIN1 directory (if bitmap skinning is in effect). Running this release requires the presence of the change.log, recover.log and master~pushbuttons.obj files in the same directory as the image (v.exe) file. This configuration should allow XP users to run without ‘non-continuable protection fault errors’.</P>
 <H2>1.1 Updated/New Reports</H2>
 <P>This release corrects a System Primitive Failure error that occurred with saving some reports as .CSV files. </P>
 <P>This release corrects a recent problem with drilldown reports which used hidden fields to pass values to component reports; the hidden field information was not being passed correctly. This fix is in SAM Pro, not the individual Drill Down reports.</P>
 <H3 style="margin-left:41.70pt;text-indent:-36.00pt;"><FONT style="font-family:'Arial'; font-size:9pt; color:#1f497d; font-weight:bold; " >1.1.1</FONT><span style="font-size:8pt; font-family='Times New Roman'; letter-spacing=0pt; font-weight=normal;">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</span>Service Invoice Report (SERVICEINVOICEv73b032.rpt)</H3>
 <P style="margin-left:36.00pt;"><FONT style="font-weight:bold; " >A Note on Report Naming:</FONT><FONT style="font-weight:bold; " ><BR></FONT>The version and build number of the first Version/Build a report is valid for will now be appended to the filename of the user reports generated and update by our Data-Basics report writers. Note that is NOT necessary to change the filename before imported the report into a database: SAM Pro will use the internal Report Id and Name when updating / adding the report. </P>
 <P><FONT style="font-weight:bold; " >07/12/2010</FONT></P>
 <P>An option to show Service Invoice detail info by Equipment is now available. </P>
 <P>A recent tax change in Canada has resulted in some users having to change the Tax Authority in the WO Sales Tax tab. In the version of the Service Invoice Report dated July 12, 2010, this has been corrected so that the Service Invoice used the tax authority information on the WO tax tab to display the tax information correctly on the invoice.   </P>
 <P><FONT style="font-weight:bold; " >08/06/2010</FONT><FONT style="font-weight:bold; " ><BR></FONT>Enhancement to auto-saving service invoices: </P>
 <P style="margin-left:36.00pt;">The system now writes the Invoice # and date to the document Description.  <BR>PM Invoices now reference the PM Invoice Workorder in the Document record. <BR>Auto-saved Service Invoices now also attach to the Client Site. </P>
 <P><FONT style="font-weight:bold; " >10/05/2010</FONT></P>
 <P>Fix needed for Batch Service Compute of COD work orders. </P>
 <P><FONT style="font-weight:bold; " >11/30/2010</FONT></P>
 <P>If the Billing Address Id is completed in the Work Order, the billing address for the Service Invoice and Worksheet come from this field. If the Override Client Id (see user note 11.1.10) is completed, but the Billing Address Id is not, the billing address for the Service Invoice and Worksheet come from the Override Client record.  </P>
 <P>Updated reports are required to support this functionality: </P>
 <P>SERVICEWORKSHEETv73b032.rpt  </P>
 <P>SERVICEINVOICEv73b032.rpt</P>
 <P><FONT style="font-weight:bold; " >08/29/2011</FONT></P>
 <P>Supports expanded Material, Other and Sub quantity fields of up to 99.999.99; previously, quantities were limited to 9,999.99. </P>
 <P><FONT style="font-weight:bold; " >2/13/2012</FONT></P>
 <P>Certain custom formats specify that the work requested is suppressed. Previously, if work orders using these formats were included in a batch service compute run with (for example) FORMAT_11 formats, the work requested suppression was not turned off for the FORMAT_11 work orders, resulting in the Work Requested not printing when it should. The service invoice (serviceinvoicev73b032.rpt) dated 2/13/2011 or later corrects this problem at both the work order and equipment levels. </P>
 <P style="margin-top:0;margin-bottom:0">&nbsp;</P>
 <H3>1.1.2 Service Worksheet Report (SERVICEWORKSHEET.rpt)</H3>
 <P>New validation ensures that template-type clients are only billed when the net invoice amount is exactly ZERO DOLLARS. The Service Billing Worksheet report has been modified to display a very noticeable warning for each WO/Job invoice that would result in a template-type client being billed for any amount other than zero. The Service Worksheet report SERVICEWORKSHEETv73b032.rpt dated 11/22/2011must be imported to support this functionality.</P>
 <P>This release also corrects a problem with auto-saving service worksheets. The registry entry sys-report-serviceworksheet must include the following registry option:  </P>
 <P style="margin-left:36.00pt;">Key Setting:  AutoSaveWhenPrinted&nbsp;Key Value: true</P>
 <P style="margin-left:36.00pt;">This registry must also include the applicable autosavefilename, autosavedirectory, and autosavebysection entries. </P>
 <H3>1.1.3 Service Invoice Post Report (SERVICEINVOICEPOST.rpt)</H3>
 <P>The Service Invoice Post Report was updated on August 19, 2010 to support multiple payment lines for COD invoices.</P>
 <H3>1.1.4 Sales Summary by Sales Rep (rslssmmryslsrp.rpt)</H3>
 <P>This report lists Sales and Quota information for your Sales Reps for the selected month (current and previous year), as well as year to date figures for the current and previous sales year. See user note 5.3 for details. This report must be installed in your database. </P>
 <H3>1.1.5 Updated Construction Invoices </H3>
 <P>(Requires rininv4.rpt and rininv3.rpt dated 08/04/2010)<BR>When auto-saving invoices, the system now writes the Invoice # and date to the document Description. </P>
 <H3>1.1.6 Report PR 941 Quarterly Summary (RPR941S.rpt)</H3>
 <P style="margin-left:36.00pt;">The Report PR 941 Quarterly Summary (RPR941S.rpt) was updated on August 13, 2010 to provide a better input document for the Federal form and on January 5, 2011 to support the change in employee/employer social security taxes. </P>
 <P style="margin-left:36.00pt;"><FONT style="font-weight:bold; " >Changes to the Report Range Screen:</FONT></P>
 <P style="margin-left:36.00pt;">In the earlier report, the report range screen provided input fields for Prior Quarters Federal Tax Adjustment and Total Deposits for Quarter. In the updated report, these fields have been lumped together in the input field (11) Total Deposits, including Prior Quarter Overpayments.</P>
 <P style="margin-left:36.00pt;">FICA Sick Pay Adjustment has been relabeled as <FONT style="font-weight:bold; " >(7b) FICA Sick Pay Adjustment</FONT>.</P>
 <P style="margin-left:36.00pt;">FICA Other Pay Adjustment has been relabeled as <FONT style="font-weight:bold; " >(7c) FICA Other Pay Adjustment</FONT>.</P>
 <P style="margin-left:36.00pt;">Advanced EIC Payments has been relabeled as (9) Advanced EIC Payments.</P>
 <P style="margin-left:36.00pt;">Additions to the Report Range Screen:</P>
 <P style="margin-left:36.00pt;"><FONT style="font-weight:bold; " >(5b)</FONT><FONT style="font-weight:bold; " > Social Security Tips</FONT><BR>SAM Pro does not track Social Security Tips. This data entry field may be completed by the user if Social Security Tips should be reported.</P>

 <H3>1.1.7 Drill Down Job Unbilled Cost Summary (DJBUBCS.rpt)</H3>
 <P style="margin-left:36.00pt;"><FONT style="font-weight:bold; " >New Option: Include Closed Jobs?</FONT><FONT style="font-weight:bold; " ><BR></FONT>The report DJBUBCS (Job Unbilled Cost Summary) excludes closed jobs.&nbsp; However, Job EOM processing does not exclude these jobs.&nbsp; The option to include closed jobs and mirror more closely what will happen in the Job EOM posting has been added to the report DJBUBCS.rpt as of 8/17/2010. This report works with SAM Pro Version 7.0 and up. </P>
 <H3>1.1.8 Report AIA Construction Inventory Report (RAIA.rpt)</H3>
 <P style="margin-left:36.00pt;">This report was updated on August 4, 2010 to support sectionkeyvalue for naming the saved report and document archiving (attaching the various versions of the report to the Client, Client Site, Job and Invoice Master records). This report may be used in Version 7.0 and up. Note that the appropriate registry options (see below) must be implemented, as well as the updated report being installed. </P>

 <P><FONT style="font-weight:bold; " >Enhanced Reports with Date Received (DAVAGE.rpt, CAPVAGE1.rpt and CAPVAGE2.rpt)</FONT></P>
 <P>These reports are version 7.30, and must be dated 11/18/2010 or higher.</P>
 <P>The Drill Down AP Aging report has been enhanced so that it may be aged by the Vendor’s Invoice Date (its current behavior), or the new Date Received field in the AP Journal. Note that if the Date Received field is blank, the date will be understood as 1900-01-01 and the amounts  will appear in the 90+ Days aging column.</P>
 <P><FONT style="font-weight:bold; " >Revised Report: Aging by Vendor</FONT> (DAPVAGEv73b033.rpt):  </P>
 <P>This release / report enhancement adds new<FONT style="font-weight:bold; " > </FONT>temp table logic to resolve out of memory errors that some users experienced when working with large databases. Note that this version of the report (dated 2/28/2011) should only be used with 7.3.493.033 and up. </P>
 <P>The updated report (DAPVAGEv73b033.rpt dated 2/28/2012) corrects a problem that only occurred if you ran this report with the Invoice Detail option set to Yes. Previously, this resulted in the associated drill-down displaying the incorrect Vendor Name; this has been corrected.  </P>
 <H3>1.1.12 Updated Report: Report PR Certified Payroll Report (RPRCRPR.rpt)</H3>
 <P><FONT style="font-weight:bold; " >Report Dated 11/12/2010</FONT></P>

 <H3>1.1.13 Client Profitability Report – Version 7.0 and Up</H3>
 <P>This report (DCPFTR.rpt) now skips entries with Client Rn = 0. Note that its component reports (CCPFTR1.rpt, CCPFTR2.rpt &amp; CCPFTR3.rpt) should be updated for Version 7.0 (these reports are dated 10/8/2009) or an error may occur with certain settings.  </P>
 <P>The<FONT style="font-weight:bold; " > </FONT>Service Account Manager from the Client Site has been added to the Drilldown Client Profitability report as a range field. Both the DCPRTR.rpt (dated 6/10/2011) and the CCPRTR1.rpt (dated 6/13/2011) must be installed to support this functionality. </P>
 <H3>1.1.14 Unvouchered AP Summary Report (12/3/2010) – Version 7.0 and Up</H3>
 <P>This version of the Unvouchered AP Summary Report (RUNVCHRDAP3.rpt) corrects a typo in the GL Entity field. </P>
 <H3>1.1.15 Reports for US Payroll Tax Reporting</H3>
 <P><FONT style="font-weight:bold; " >Payroll Employee Tax Table Report (12/28/2010) </FONT></P>
 <P>This report (RPREMTX.rpt) enables the user to print the contents of the Employee Record Tax tab; it is useful to confirm data entry, and may also be run to verify that the both the FICA SS and FICA SSER tables are correctly specified in all applicable Employee records. We recommend that you filter on the Tax Tables beginning with FICA (FICA%) or FICA SS (FICA SS%) to make the report easier to review. </P>
 <P>The Employee Date Termination Range can be set to the blank date (1900-01-01) to display only those employees who have not been terminated. To include employees who have not been terminated, or will be terminated after 2010, the Employee Date Terminated Range may be set as follows:   sql=(emplye_dte_trmntd='1900-01-01' or emplye_dte_trmntd&gt;='2011-01-01’)</P>

 <P>The Audit Report option of Report W2 Electronic File (report RW2EF.rpt dated 2/21/2012) has been modified so that the totals row is offset so that larger payroll amounts do not overlap.  This change impacts the Audit option only. This report is suitable for version 7.2 and up.</P>
 <H3>1.1.16 Revised Report AR Aging (DARAGE.rpt) </H3>
 <P>This drill-down report has been revised as of 3/9/2011 to better handle unapplied cash receipts. </P>

 <P><FONT style="font-weight:bold; " >8/29/2011</FONT></P>
 <P>The Estimated Tax for Fixed Price Scopes will be displayed when the Print Estimated Tax box is flagged. </P>
 <P>This report adds the ability to expand the printing of Scope Of Services by adding Notes attached to the Quote record via the sidebar Notes button.  To enable this feature, The Notes Summary field must contain the Option Code.  If the system locates the appropriate Notes records, their text will be printed following the Scope of Services text for that option. Up to 60 lines of 80 characters each are supported. If the Notes text is longer than 80 characters, the system will automatically wrap the text to the next lines when it is printed on the quote.  If the Notes text exceeds the report limit, it will be truncated. Note that this field will not be split between pages. </P>

 <H2>1.2 Viewers (General)</H2>
 <P>This release eliminates a sporadic problem where the Change Record message displayed twice when leaving a record without saving your changes.</P>
 <P>This release corrects a problem where the wrong sidebar appeared when the Refresh button was clicked in the Client Site Equipment and Job Billing Item viewers</P>
 <P>This release extends the ability to successfully create a named range to history viewers opened at the filter screen. </P>
 <P>In previous releases, the mouse over box drawn around bitmaps was not always removed when the mouse was quickly run over a series of buttons.  This problem has been corrected so that these “leftover” boxes no longer appear when the mouse has moved off of the button.  </P>
 <P>More efficient/quicker right-click open of viewers implemented.</P>
 <P>When typing in a multiple line text box with only one line showing, pressing Enter once again adds a carriage return instead of moving the cursor to the next field. </P>
 <P>This release corrects a Field Size error that only occurred if the user saved a record while a push button on one of the child lines in the record was in mouse over mode. </P>
 <P>This release corrects a spurious invalid id error that occurred when an Id of the maximum field size is typed in and the user presses the Enter key to advance to the next field. </P>
 <P>This release corrects a display issue that occurred<FONT style="font-weight:bold; " > </FONT>if Windows Clear Text is enabled: field labels would display bolder when the screen was repainted after selecting an Id. In this version, SAM Pro handles Clear Text so that labels will be displayed correctly.  </P>
 <P>This release corrects a display problem that occurred if you used Ctrl+Z (or the View menu option) to Zoom while in Single View, and then clicked the Lines View button. Note that the user is not permitted to access Single View (with the Magnify button) while in Zoomed mode. </P>
 <P>This release corrects the horizontal placement of bitmaps in the top button bar.  </P>
 <P>The user will now be notified if an attempt to create a duplicate entry fails. For example, if the database is structured properly, there is a UNIQUE CONSTRAINT such that a technician cannot be scheduled on the same date and work order more than once. Previously, the duplicate line would not be added, but the user would not be notified. In this release, the error is reported to the user.</P>
 <P>This release corrects sporadic problems where the screen would erroneously autoscroll when you clicked into a field (e.g., in the AP Journal, the upper pane would auto-scroll when you tabbed into the Account Period field under some screen resolutions).</P>
 <P>When the Refresh button was clicked,  certain fields (such as the Work Order’s AR Term Code on the COD tab) were not reloaded from current data. All fields are now reloaded when Refresh is clicked. </P>
 <P>The system now prevents unnecessary 'Change Record?' prompts associated with starter-type functions such as Start Create PM Work Orders.</P>
 <P><FONT style="font-weight:bold; " >Validation in </FONT><FONT style="font-weight:bold; " >Phone</FONT><FONT style="font-weight:bold; " > / Fax </FONT><FONT style="font-weight:bold; " >Number Fields</FONT><FONT style="font-weight:bold; " ><BR></FONT>The software now validates that phone numbers only contain numeric digits when the user attempts to exit the field; this addresses the problem of users inadvertently pasting letters into phone numbers. </P>
 <P>In some instances, the switch from the lines view to the single/detail view generated an error that appeared to be data related but was really a timing problem. This has been corrected.  </P>
 <H3>1.2.1 Child Tab Detail / Single View Enhancements: </H3>
 <P>This release adds functionality to the Single (detail) View of child tab lines that are accessed via the Magnify button. </P>
 <P><IMG src="images/magnify.gif" align=left border=0 height=18 width=18 alt="images\magnify.gif"> The Magnify button (used to zoom in on the Single/Detail view of lines) has been updated to help users distinguish between zooming in on a particular line, and searching for an Id (in the case of Id Search (discuss below). <FONT style="font-weight:bold; " >In addition, the Magnify button now responds to a single click</FONT> – in previous release, it was necessary to double-click it. </P>
 <P><FONT style="font-weight:bold; " >New Buttons:</FONT></P>
 <P>This release adds graphical buttons to the Single (detail) View of child tab lines that are accessed via the Magnify button. The following buttons enable the user to scroll though the lines in this child tab:</P>
 <P><IMG src="images/linefirst.gif" border=0 height=32 width=32 alt="images\linefirst.gif"> <IMG src="images/lineprevious.gif" border=0 height=32 width=32 alt="images\lineprevious.gif"><IMG src="images/linenext.gif" border=0 height=32 width=32 alt="images\linenext.gif"><IMG src="images/linelast.gif" border=0 height=32 width=32 alt="images\linelast.gif"></P>
 <P>First – Previous – Next – Last line in the tab</P>
 <P>In addition, Add, Insert and Delete lines buttons have been added to enable this functionality in the Single (detail) view line screens. </P>
 <P><IMG src="images/lineadd.gif" border=0 height=32 width=94 alt="images\lineadd.gif"> <IMG src="images/lineinsert.gif" border=0 height=32 width=94 alt="images\lineinsert.gif"> <IMG src="images/linedelete.gif" border=0 height=32 width=94 alt="images\linedelete.gif"> </P>
 <P><IMG src="images/linesview.gif" border="0" height="32" width="94" alt="images\linesview.gif"> Clicking the Lines View button will return the tab to its initial, multiple line view. </P>
 <P><FONT style="font-weight:bold; " >Child Lines – Odd / Even Color: </FONT></P>
 <P>Child tab lines are now displayed using the Odd  / Even color scheme selected by the user with the Set Color button. The selected line will be displayed in the Background color selected by the user with the Set Color button. </P>
 <H3>1.2.2 Top Button Bar </H3>
 <P>Some buttons have been re-arranged so that the Exit button is always the right-most button. The Alarm Board button has been moved the second row of the top button bar. </P>
 <H3>1.2.3 New Windows Pulldown Menu</H3>
 <P>A new pulldown menu labeled ‘Windows’ has been added to SAM Pro windows.&nbsp; It can be used as an additional tool to navigate within SAMPRO to currently open SAM Pro windows (for records, starter functions, and reports)  by simply selecting an entry on the Windows list. </P>
 <H3>1.2.4  Status Pane</H3>
 <P>This release includes updates to the text that is displayed in the status pane at the very bottom of the SAM Pro window when the user places the mouse cursor over a button. A registry entry is also available to adjust the status line’s height, foreground color, background color and font. You may use the security option of this entry to help remind multiple security users how they are logged in.  See user note 2.27 for details. </P>
 <H3>1.2.5 Id Search Buttons</H3>
 <P><IMG src="images/idsearch.gif" align=left border=0 height=16 width=16 alt="images\idsearch.gif"> This enhancement enables the addition of the Id Lookup button to the right-hand side of Id fields. This enhancement lets the user easily see which fields are Id fields, and also select the field AND bring up the list in a single click of the button. See user note 2.8.9 for details on enabling this option.</P>
 <P><IMG src="images/idsearch-.gif" border="0" height="16" width="16" alt="images\idsearch-.gif"> This functionality has been expanded to support disabled fields. If a field is disabled, the grayed out version of the Id Search button will be displayed, and the user will not be able to access the field by clicking on the button. </P>
 <H3>1.2.6 Side Button Bar </H3>
 <P><FONT style="font-weight:bold; " >The Delete Record button no longer appears on the Side Button bar. </FONT>To delete a record, the user may 1) Access the menu bar to select Record&gt;&gt;Delete Record or 2) Use the keyboard equivalent Ctrl+d to delete the record. </P>
 <P>This release corrects a problem where the Add record button was not grayed out when a new record was added. </P>
 <H3>1.2.7 Calendar and Clock</H3>
 <P>Updated buttons that are easier to read on high-resolution monitors have been added to the following screens: </P>
 <P style="margin-left:36.00pt;"><FONT style="font-weight:bold; " >Clock:</FONT> Increment/Decrement Minutes/Hours - <IMG src="images/clockincdec.gif" border=0 height=18 width=36 alt="images\clockincdec.gif"> </P>
 <P style="margin-left:36.00pt;"><FONT style="font-weight:bold; " >Calendar:</FONT> Previous/Next Month - <IMG src="images/monthprevious.gif" border=0 height=28 width=60 alt="images\monthprevious.gif"> <IMG src="images/monthnext.gif" border=0 height=28 width=60 alt="images\monthnext.gif"> </P>
 <H3>1.2.8 Record Validation </H3>
 <P>WO Inventory (and other journals): This release implements enhanced journal validation logic to prevent sporadic posting reversals with inappropriate Transaction Ids. If this situation is about to occur, the erroneous reversal is suppressed AND an error is written to the error log noting the reversal suppression. </P>
 <P>Additional validations have been added to alert a user when they are in danger of exiting a record without saving it. </P>
 <P>When you access another record by entering its ID directly into the field at the top of the viewer,  the system will now display the following message if any unsaved changes are detected in the original record: </P>
 <P style="margin-left:36.00pt;">Warning: the changes made to record ‘<FONT style="font-style:italic; " >original record id</FONT>’ were not saved.</P>
 <P style="margin-left:36.00pt;">Do you wish to return to ‘<FONT style="font-style:italic; " >original record id</FONT>’ to save your changes?</P>
 <P>If you click Yes, the original record id will be restored. At this point, you should save the record before accessing a different record or cloning a new one.</P>
 <P>If you click No, your changes to the original record will be discarded, and the record whose id you entered will be displayed. </P>
 <P>This release also adds validation when precisely one field (not the record’s Id field) is changed without tabbing out of it. The system now displays the Change Record message in this circumstance when you do one of the following:</P>
 <P style="margin-left:36.00pt;">Click the List button and select another record</P>
 <P style="margin-left:36.00pt;">Click the Close (X) button</P>
 <P style="margin-left:36.00pt;">Click the Record Up or Down button</P>
 <H3>1.2.9 List Highlight Colors</H3>
 <P>In previous versions, the highlight color for lists (including new call and the dispatch board) was a bright blue. In Version 7.3, the highlight was changed to a dark gray for better readability.  In response to user comments, this highlight color has been changed back to blue.  </P>
 <H3>1.2.10 Bitmap ‘Skinning’</H3>
 <P><IMG src="images/mc036.gif" border=0 height=270 width=892 alt="images\mc036.gif"> </P>
 <P>Version 7.3 supports a new and brighter look for SAM Pro via bitmap ‘skinning’ of the top and side button bars.  These newer bitmaps are also designed to display more clearly on today’s high-resolution monitors. To implement this look requires a few simple registry settings and the set of SKIN1 bitmaps from Data-Basics. If you have been using SAM Pro for many years, this may feel like a big change, but once you start using the new bitmaps you will be surprised by how quickly you adapt to and enjoy using them. See user note 2.32 for details on configuring your system to run with these new skins.  A PowerPoint entitled Graphical User Enhancements provides additional details on installing and using this enhancement; contact your support representative for details. </P>
 <H3>1.2.11 Notes</H3>
 <P>If a user (who was not a notes administrator) accessed a private note created by someone else, and then attempted to change it, the message “you cannot change the record because the change button is disabled” would appear and the user would be unable to exit SAM Pro correctly. In this release, the message appears, but the user is allowed to leave the notes viewer.</P>
 <H3>1.2.12 New Help Menu Option - SQL History:</H3>
 <P>There may be times when your support representative needs to see the SQL generated by certain actions: the SQL History option has been added to the Help menu to enable this. </P>
 <P><FONT style="font-weight:bold; " >To capture SQL History</FONT><FONT style="font-weight:bold; " >: </FONT></P>
 <P style="margin-left:36.00pt;">Select Help &gt; SQL History.  This menu provides three options: Capture SQL History, View SQLHistory and Clear SQL History.  If a check mark does not yet appear next to Capture SQL History select this option to turn this feature on. Next, perform the steps that your support representation tells you.</P>
 <P><FONT style="font-weight:bold; " >To View SQL History: </FONT></P>
 <P style="margin-left:36.00pt;">Use the menu option Help&gt;SQL History&gt;View SQL History</P>
 <P style="margin-left:36.00pt;">A workspace window will appear with the SQL history that has been logged. In the workspace with, select File &gt; Save As.  A browser window will appear: browse to a location you will be able to retrieve the file from, and save it using a appropriate name. </P>
 <P><FONT style="font-weight:bold; " >To Clear SQL History:</FONT></P>
 <P style="margin-left:36.00pt;">The Help&gt;Clear SQL History option may be used to clear SQL history before making another test.</P>
 <P><FONT style="font-weight:bold; " >To Turn Off SQL History:</FONT></P>
 <P style="margin-left:36.00pt;">It a check mark appears next to the Capture SQL History menu option, is it toggled on. To toggle Capture SQL History off, select Help&gt;SQL History&gt;  Capture SQL History. Note that even if you do not explicitly turn this feature off, it will be disabled when you log off. </P>
 <H3>1.2.13 Type-Ahead/Autosearch Enhancement</H3>
 <P>The 'Type-Ahead' feature allows the user to position the caret to a specific row of a list just by typing the first few characters of the desired row. In previous versions, this only worked only on first column of the list. This release extends this functionality so that it works on whatever the column the cursor is positioned in IF the target column has been pre-sorted in ascending order by clicking the column header of the desired column.<BR><BR>For example:</P>
 <P>&nbsp; 1) the user sorts column three in ascending order<BR>&nbsp; 2) the user positions the cursor at the first character in column three<BR>&nbsp; 3) the user types the characters b, o, and b.<BR>&nbsp; 4) the cursor will automatically positioned on the forth character of the first line having column three beginning with 'bob'.</P>
 <P style="margin-top:0;margin-bottom:0">&nbsp;</P>
 <H2>1.3 Viewer Filtering</H2>
 <H3>1.3.1 Additional Filters Added to the AP Journal, Bank Transfer, and Checklist Viewers</H3>
 <P style="margin-left:36.00pt;">Bank Transfer: GL Bank Account </P>
 <P style="margin-left:36.00pt;">AP Journal: EFT/Credit Trx: Id and Payment Type (Check, EFT or Credit) filters </P>
 <P style="margin-left:36.00pt;">Check Viewer: EFT/Credit Trx: Id and Payment Type (Check, EFT or Credit) filters </P>
 <H3>1.3.2 Special Filtering for Encapsulated GL Accounts </H3>
 <P>Special Filtering for encapsulated GL Accounts has been added to the AP Journal, AR Cash Receipts Journal, AR Sales Journal, Bank Deposit and Bank Reconciliation Journals. Since multiple GL accounts are present in the ‘parent’ tables of the several of the Journals, simple range filters (where you simply enter the GL Account Id) do not work for these &quot;encapsulated&quot; fields.  To enable the user to filter on a specific parent GL Account, special filter ranges with the necessary SQL to filter on a specific GL Account have been added to following Journals:</P>
 <P style="margin-left:36.00pt;"> AP Journal: GL AP Control Account and GL Bank Account filters&nbsp;</P>
 <P style="margin-left:36.00pt;">AR Cash Receipts Journal: GL Bank Account filter</P>
 <P style="margin-left:36.00pt;">AR Sales Journal: GL AR Control Account and GL Bank Account (for COD Cash Receipts) filters</P>
 <P style="margin-left:36.00pt;">Bank Deposit: GL Bank Account and GL Sweep Account Filters</P>
 <P style="margin-left:36.00pt;">Bank Reconciliation Journal: GL Bank Account, GL Fees Account and GL Interest Account filters </P>
 <H3>Example on Using Filters for Encapsulated Fields: Bank Reconciliation Journal</H3>
 <P>Range filters for the GL Bank Account Id:, GL Fees Account Id: and GL Interest Account Id: have been added to the range filter screen. When the range filter is initially displayed, the GL Bank Account range appears as follows:</P>
 <P style="margin-left:36.00pt;"><FONT style="font-weight:bold; " >GL Bank Account Id:<BR></FONT>sql= gl_bnk_glaccnt_rn in (select glaccnt_rn from glaccnt where glaccnt_id like '%')</P>
 <P>Suppose that your firm uses more than one Bank Account. To filter on Bank Reconciliation Entries for a specific GL Bank Account, simply replace the % in the SQL statement with the GL Bank Account Id you wish to filter on. For example, to filter on the GL Bank Account Id 1005, simply change the SQL statement in the range to:</P>
 <P style="margin-left:36.00pt;">sql= gl_bnk_glaccnt_rn in (select glaccnt_rn from glaccnt where glaccnt_id like '<FONT style="font-weight:bold; " >1005</FONT>')</P>
 <P style="margin-left:36.00pt;"><FONT style="font-weight:bold; text-decoration:underline;" >Tip: Saving Ranges</FONT></P>
 <P style="margin-left:36.00pt;">Rather than adjust the SQL statement each time you use the filter, you may save your settings as a range. To do so:</P>
 <P style="margin-left:36.00pt;">1. Complete all range fields as desired. </P>
 <P style="margin-left:36.00pt;">2. Select a Filter Key (in the upper left-hand portion of the range screen) to control the sort order of the records that you are filtering on. </P>
 <P style="margin-left:36.00pt;">3. Click the Save Range button.</P>
 <P style="margin-left:36.00pt;">A box will appear requesting that you enter the name of the range to save. Type in a descriptive range name – begin the name with an asterisk it you want all users to be able to select the range. In our Bank Reconciliation example, this might be *Bank Account 1005</P>
 <P style="margin-left:36.00pt;">4. Click the OK button. Your custom range will be listed in the Filter Ranges pane. When you access this range viewer in the future, you can select a saved range by clicking on it in the Filter Ranges pane. </P>
 <H2>1.4 Login</H2>
 <P>The size of the user login window has been made slightly larger to accommodate small screens with high resolutions. </P>
 <H2>1.5 Document Management / Archiving </H2>
 <P>Updated buttons (easier to read on high-resolution monitors) have been added to the Document Viewer: <IMG src="images/browse_new.gif" border=0 height=28 width=78 alt="images\browse_new.gif"> <IMG src="images/scandocument_new.gif" border=0 height=28 width=78 alt="images\scandocument_new.gif"> </P>
 <P>The Archive File Location and Type fields in the Document Record are now successfully completed during the scanning process. </P>
 <P>SAM Pro no longer assumes that the user included a file extension in the original file name. This corrects a problem encountered during the TechAnywhere post. </P>
 <P>The View Documents filter now includes ranges for Table Name, Reference Id and Reference Name.  </P>
 <P>A sort option has been added to the Document viewer (as accessed from View Document, not a record’s attachments). The new option is DocumentByReferenceId, with the columns: </P>
 <P>&nbsp;Reference Id-Reference Name-Category-Description-Date Logged-Document Id</P>
 <P>This release also corrects a system primitive error that occurred in View Documents if you changed the sort order in the KeyNames pane and then clicked the Create .PDF button. The Create PDF button now supports use with archived documents tagged as ‘Read Only’. </P>
 <H3>1.5.1 Automatic Attachments to additional tables</H3>
 <P>This enhancement allows the user to specify attachments to other tables in the record when attaching or scanning a new document from the viewer (functionality that Quick Attach already provides). See user note 2.26 for the registry option to do so. </P>
 <H2>1.6 Saving Report Files as .csv</H2>
 <P>This release corrects an issue that only occurred if the user’s Windows folder settings were set to hide extensions for known file types; the file was not assigned a file extension. In this release, the filename extension is now correctly set to .csv.</P>
 <H2>1.7 Menu Option to Specify Windows to be Opened when User Logs In </H2>
 <P>A new option has been added to the File menu: Save Viewer Attributes. This menu option may be used with or without the registry option that sets the default window size and position (see user note 1.7.1 below).</P>
 <P>When you select this option from a viewer, the Select Viewer Attributes to Save box will appear. It has two check boxes:</P>
 <P><FONT style="font-weight:bold; " >Save Size/Position?</FONT></P>
 <P style="margin-left:36.00pt;">If you check this box, the next time this viewer is opened, will be displayed as it is now. For example, if you have a very wide monitor, you might like to have your Folders viewer on the left side of the screen, and your Labor Journal on the right. To do so, you would position these viewers as desired, select File=&gt;Save Viewer Attributes, and check the Save Size/Position box, and then click OK.  In this example, you would repeat this process twice – once for the Folders Viewer and again for the Labor Journal. If you are doing so for the Notes viewer, you must log off and on again to see the results. </P>
 <P><FONT style="font-weight:bold; " >Open during login?</FONT></P>
 <P style="margin-left:36.00pt;">If this box is checked, this viewer will be open during the login process. It is recommended that you only check this box for viewers you have open every day. </P>
 <P style="margin-left:36.00pt;"><FONT style="font-weight:bold; " >Tip: Undoing Viewer Attributes<BR></FONT>To undo Viewer Attributes, select File=&gt;Set Viewer Attributes, clear the check boxes, and click OK. </P>
 <P style="margin-left:36.00pt;"><FONT style="font-weight:bold; " >Tip: Resetting Viewer Attributes<BR></FONT>To reset Viewer Attributes, first select File=&gt;Set Viewer Attributes, clear the check boxes, and click OK.  Next, reset them by selecting File=&gt;Set Viewer Attributes, and checking the appropriate boxes. </P>
 <H3>1.7.1 Registry to Control Initial Home Position and Size of Open Windows</H3>
 <P>This functionality applies to record Viewers, most initial Starter screens, and Report ranges. The size and position settings in this registry will be overridden is the user has individually set the size and positions via the File menu: Save Viewer Attributes functionality.</P>
 <P><FONT style="font-weight:bold; " >Id:</FONT> sys-screen</P>
 <P>Note that this setting may be customized by user with the sys-screen-branchid-userid or sys-screen- - userid formats. </P>
 <P><FONT style="font-weight:bold; " >Setting Key:</FONT> nomaximize&nbsp;<FONT style="font-weight:bold; " >Setting Value:</FONT> true  </P>
 <P style="margin-left:113.75pt;">(default is false: all record viewers are maximized when initially opened)</P>
 <P><FONT style="font-weight:bold; " >Setting Key:</FONT> topleftratio&nbsp;<FONT style="font-weight:bold; " >Setting Value:</FONT> x@y</P>
 <P>‘at’ allows you to specify the initial location of the top left corner of the SAM Pro window (as a percentage of the screen) of the upper left corner of the image. For example, the setting value 10@5 moves set the initial open location to the right by 10% of the screen width, and down by 5% of the screen height.</P>
 <P><FONT style="font-weight:bold; " >Setting Key:</FONT> sizeratio&nbsp;<FONT style="font-weight:bold; " >Setting Value:</FONT> x@y</P>
 <P>‘at’ allows you to specify the initial size of the SAM Pro window (as a percentage of the screen). For example, the setting value 40@60 sets the initial open size to forty percent of the screen’s width and 60% of its height. This might be an appropriate setting if you have a very large monitor (e.g., 1900 x 1080, for example).  </P>
 <H2>1.8 Document viewer</H2>
 <P>Filter Screen: if the user double-clicks on the Reference Id range, the system will alert the user that the Reference Id must be entered manually instead of displaying an error message. </P>
 <P>Document References Tab: if the user double-clicks on the Reference Id field without first entering a valid Table Name, the system will alert the user that the Table Name field must be completed first. </P>
 <H2>1.9 Zip Code Lookup </H2>
 <P>Back in Version 6.2, the ability to set related fields from the Zipcode table was implemented via registry (sys-zipcode-lookup was required). At some point, the software stopped  recognizing the registry, and always defaulted from the zipcode table. This was a problem because you could not turn the functionality off – for example, to prevent the Branch Id from defaulting when a new Vendor record was created.  </P>
 <P>In this release, the registry functionality has been restored. What this means, however, is that if the registry is not in place, defaulting from the zipcode table will no longer work. Check that your database includes the appropriate registry if you wish the zipcode table fields to default; see user note 2.14 for details. </P>
 <H2>1.10 Preview Reports</H2>
 <P>This release corrects a spurious error in recent releases that occurred when moving the mouse over a report preview screen. </P>
 <P>This release corrects problems that occurred if the user clicked on the Preview Report option of the report range viewer and selected HTML or Text: selecting the Text option resulted in an error, selecting the HTML option did not generate an error but did not open the IE browser.</P>
 <P><FONT style="font-weight:bold; " >Important Note:</FONT></P>
 <P>For the HTLM option to work correctly, the system must be aware of the path to the IE Browser. Right click your Internet Explorer Icon select properties. The target line has the Directory Path of Internet Explorer.</P>
 <P>Add/Change the line in registry sys-ffv-global-settings</P>
 <P>Setting Key: iebrowserpath&nbsp;  Setting Value: <FONT style="font-style:italic; " >path</FONT></P>
 <P>Note: make sure to use the Directory Path Only.</P>
 <P>Example:  </P>
 <P>Setting Key: iebrowserpath  Setting Value: C:\Program Files\Internet Explorer</P>
 <P><FONT style="font-weight:bold; " >Correction to Documentation: </FONT></P>
 <P>The<FONT style="font-weight:bold; " > </FONT>documentation for the browserpath was incorrect in previous versions of Help. It was incorrectly specified as registry id iebrowserpath and path=... as an option instead of the sys-ffv-global-setting noted above. </P>
 <H2>1.11 Custom Index (new record)</H2>
 <H3>Purpose:</H3>
 <P>Based on their analysis, database administrators may identify and implement custom indexes (in addition to those maintained by SAM Pro) which enhance a particular system’s performance.  Until this release, these custom indexes had to be re-implemented after each database conversion. This enhancement enables the DBAs or system administrators to store custom indexes within their data. The next time the database conversion is triggered (when updating to a new version), the SAM Pro software will automatically install all active Custom Indexes (not flagged as Obsolete). </P>

 <H2>1.12 Message Table Purge/Archive </H2>
 <P>A new Starter function, Start Message Table Purge, has been added to the system to clean up the Message table (used by TechAnywhere, SaqeQuest, FMMS, etc.) and improve the performance of the Work Order TechAnywhere tab. By default, this function will purge / archive all Posted messages that are 60+ days old. Unless disabled via registry, these messages will be archived to the new mssgearcve table. </P>
 <P>When this function is selected, it runs without further user input. The intention is that this purge/archive can be run unattended (like the other purge/archive functions) as a Scheduled Event.</P>
 <H3>1.12.1 Registry Entry to Control Purge Message Table</H3>
 <P><FONT style="font-weight:bold; " >Id: sys-start-sprgemssgetble</FONT></P>

 <P>This registry option allows you to disable archiving of purged messages to the mssgearcve table. If these options are enabled, the purged messages will be deleted, and will no longer be available for inspection in your database. </P>
 <H2>1.13 Accounting Period</H2>
 <P><FONT style="font-weight:bold; " >New Field: Work Order Other to GL:<BR></FONT>In previous releases, the GL was never impacted from Work Order Other tab entries. In this release, the Work Order Other tab will write to GL if this field is flagged. </P>

 <H2>1.14 Start Report Import - Report Import Checklist</H2>
 <P><FONT style="font-weight:bold; " >New Fields:</FONT></P>
 <P><FONT style="font-weight:bold; " >CaseNo:<BR></FONT>This field displays the internal Case Number (if completed) from the report that is being imported. </P>
 <P><FONT style="font-weight:bold; " >First Version No:<BR></FONT>This field displays the First Version Number (if completed) from the report that is being imported. This is the first SAM Pro version number the report should be used with.</P>
 <P><FONT style="font-weight:bold; " >Install Version:<BR></FONT>This field displays the First Version Number (if completed) of the report that is currently installed in the system. This field will display as ‘Not Installed’ if this report is not already in the database, or Unknown if the First Version Number is not completed in the installed report.  </P>
 <P><FONT style="font-weight:bold; " >Custom For: <BR></FONT>This field displays the Custom For field (if completed) from the report that is being imported.</P>
 <P><FONT style="font-weight:bold; " >Changed Field: <BR>Do:</FONT></P>
 <P>The system will consider the contents of the First Version No:. Install Version:, and the version of SAM Pro itself when determining whether or not to flag a report for import. A report will be flagged for import if its First Version Number is the highest allowable for the SAM Pro version running.  </P>
 <P>The import will not check the Do box for any reports with Unknown status for the first or installed version number.</P>
 <H2>1.15 Database Conversion</H2>
 <P>This release corrects an error encountered when logging out after a database conversion. </P>
 <P>This release<FONT style="font-weight:bold; " > </FONT>implements incremental commits when creating Foreign Keys and Indexes during SQL server conversions.</P>
 <H2>1.16 Printer List </H2>
 <P>Users with a very large number of printers may have found some missing from SAM Pro’s list of printers because the allowable number of characters for all the printers’ names was exceeded. The allowable number of characters has been expanded from 6000 to 10,000 characters to correct this problem.</P>
 <H2>1.17 SAM Pro Services </H2>
 <P>Previously,<FONT style="font-weight:bold; " > </FONT>if an error occurred during startup of a Sampro service, the image was left running in the background using up RAM. The image is now successfully closed preventing this memory leak. </P>
 <H2>1.18 Wheel Mouse Users</H2>
 <P>This release prevents “Key is missing” errors and other undesirable results if the user scrolls their Wheel Mouse while waiting for the Service Invoice (and other reports) to display. </P>
 <H2>1.19 End Key</H2>
 <P>The End Key now positions the cursor correctly (at the end for the text) in Id-type fields when the Id Search/Lookup buttons are turned on. In multi-line textbox fields with word wrap, Ctrl-End now also works correctly if the text includes an embedded blank line, positioning the cursor at the end of all the lines of text.</P>
 <H2>1.20 User Viewer – Registry Tab</H2>
 <P>This release implements the use of the Registry tab in the User Viewer to add / override sys-ffv-global-settings for this User. Since these settings are loaded when the user logs on, he or she must log on after User Registry changes are made to see them in effect.</P>
 <H2>1.21 Email (SMTP)</H2>
 <P>This release adds a 'Date:' header line to email messages to support email servers that require it. An updated version of the XmlToPdf.jar file is included in the zip file for this release that also supports the Date header line for emails with .PDF attachments sent from SAM Pro. </P>
 <P>The system now correctly handles the case of a message containing a line consisting solely of a period. </P>
 <H2>1.22  Startme.exe</H2>
 <P>This release includes a new startme.exe file.  When the first user (of a particular OS) accesses a new image, the underscore version of the v.exe runtime will be generated with the user’s OS designation. For example, if you have XP and Windows 7 users, you would expect to see two runtime images: </P>
 <P>V_2011_9_16_12_13__18_[Microsoft_Windows_XP].exe and </P>
 <P>V_2011_9_16_12_13__18_[Microsoft_Windows_7_Professional].exe </P>
 <P>XP users will be directed to the XP runtime, and Windows 7 Professional users will be access the Windows 7 runtime. </P>
 <H2>1.23 History Table Viewers</H2>
 <P>In this release, History record viewers will start at the Range screen to avoid the unnecessary load time need to display the entire list of entries.  In previous releases, the registry entry sys-startscreen-filter was required to implement this functionality.  </P>
 <H2>1.24 VM Memory </H2>
 <P>SAM Pro’s Smalltalk virtual memory has been expanded to 250MB from 150MB.  This should better support the running of extremely long reports and the unfiltered display of large record viewers without encountering out of memory errors. </P>
 <P style="margin-top:0;margin-bottom:0">&nbsp;</P>
 <H1>2. Registry Entries</H1>
 <H2>2.0 Registry Viewer</H2>
 <P>When a Registry record containing an option that is flagged as Multiple Settings (e.g.,  some sys-printer-W2 records) is loaded into the viewer, the option will be ‘exploded’ so that each setting now as its own Setting Key/Setting Value line. Disabled lines are excluded from this enhancement. </P>
 <H2>2.1 Job (sys-viewer-vjb)</H2>
 <H3>2.1.1 Registry Option to Set Effective Date of Budget Tab Entries to the Job Open Date</H3>
 <P>By default the effective date of Budget Entries posted to Job History via the Budget tab is set to blank (1900-01-01). This could cause issues when compiling a WIP summary report.&nbsp; For example, suppose the user runs a WIP summary report for say 03/31/2010, and then places new jobs in service in April.&nbsp; If the user must re-run the report for the end of March (03/31/2010) the totals will change (using the budgets from Job Viewer) whereas, using the Job Journal or if the budgets had a date they would have remained consistent.&nbsp;</P>
 <P>The following registry option causes entries from the Job’s and the Project Manager Workbench’s Budget tab to use the Date Opened from the Job record for both forwarding and reversing entries: </P>
 <P><FONT style="font-weight:bold; " >Setting Key:</FONT> BudgetEffectiveDate&nbsp;<FONT style="font-weight:bold; " >Setting Value:</FONT> DateOpened</P>
 <P style="margin-left:36.00pt;"><FONT style="font-weight:bold; " >Note</FONT><FONT style="font-weight:bold; " > on Existing Data</FONT><FONT style="font-weight:bold; " >: </FONT><FONT style="font-weight:bold; " > </FONT>when implementing this registry, you may wish to update the Job History Budget entries generated by the Job Budget tab to correspond to the Job’s Date Opened. An SQL script for this purpose may be run to update your data: contact your support representative for details.  </P>
 <H2>2.2  AP Checks (sys-report-rapchck)</H2>
 <H3>2.2.1 MICR Support for multiple bank accounts</H3>
 <P>With this enhancement, the AP Check Entry Fields GL Account and GL Entity are used to look up the registry. If none found the default is used (sys-report-rapchck). In this way you can assign different MICR values to each GL Account/Entity group.</P>
 <P><FONT style="font-weight:bold; " >Id:</FONT> &nbsp;sys-report-rapchck-<FONT style="font-style:italic; " >GLACCTID-GLENTTYID</FONT> </P>

 <H2>2.3 Quote Viewer (sys-viewer-vqte)</H2>
 <P>This release corrects a display issue encountered when clicking the filter button.</P>
 <H3>2.3.1 Registry Option to ‘Pop’ Site Notes without Prompting the User</H3>
 <P>When you begin to add a Quote in Quote Master, the system will now ask if you wish to view the Notes associated with the Site you selected (either directly or by choosing a source Work Order). The following registry options may be used to alter this behavior:</P>
 <P><FONT style="font-weight:bold; " >Id: sys-viewer-vqte</FONT></P>
 <P><FONT style="font-weight:bold; " >Setting Key: </FONT>SiteNotesNoPrompt<FONT style="font-weight:bold; " >&nbsp;Setting Value: </FONT>true</P>
 <P>This entry changes the default behavior of Quote Master – which is to prompt the user to view any notes that are associated with the selected Client Site when a new Quote is being created.  If you implement this option, Quote Master will automatically display the list of notes with a Client Site is selected (either directly or by choosing a source Work Order). </P>
 <H3>2.3.2 Registry Option to Suppress Site Notes when Creating a Quote</H3>
 <P><FONT style="font-weight:bold; " >Id: sys-viewer-vqte</FONT></P>
 <P><FONT style="font-weight:bold; " >Setting Key:</FONT> nonotes&nbsp;<FONT style="font-weight:bold; " >Setting Value:</FONT> true</P>
 <P>This entry changes the default behavior of Quote Master and suppresses the display of Site Notes when a Quote is being created. This restores the behavior present in version 7.2 and earlier.</P>
 <H3>2.3.3 Flat Rate Import Tax Rules</H3>
 <P>By default, the Flat Rate Import code forces each line's Tax Type Id to 'n/a' instead of applying normal SAMPRO tax rules. The following registry setting may be used to use the Job’s tax rules when setting the Tax Type. </P>
 <P><FONT style="font-weight:bold; " >Registry Id: sys-viewer-vqte</FONT></P>
 <P><FONT style="font-weight:bold; " >Setting Key:</FONT> ApplyTaxRulesOnFlatRateImport&nbsp;<FONT style="font-weight:bold; " >Setting Value:</FONT> true</P>
 <H3>2.3.4 Allow Changes to Accepted Options</H3>
 <P>In an earlier release, validation was added to disallow changes to any scope lines if the status is set Printed, Accepted, Approved or Declined, forcing the user to first change the status to Open to make changes. Changes to Labor, Inventory, Material, Other and Subcontractor lines were only allowed if the associated Scope Option was set to Open.<BR><BR>The validation associated with Accepted options has resulted in procedural issues for some of our customers. For this reason, the following registry setting may be implemented to allow changes to Accepted options on the Scope tab, and also to Labor, Inventory, Material, Other and Subcontractor lines associated with Accepted Scope Options.  </P>
 <P><FONT style="font-weight:bold; " >Note:</FONT> this registry option should be used with caution if CRMAnywhere is enabled; options that a customer has accepted should not be altered. </P>
 <P><FONT style="font-weight:bold; " >Setting Key:</FONT> IgnoreAcceptedValidation  <FONT style="font-weight:bold; " >Setting Value:</FONT> true  (default is false)</P>
 <P style="margin-top:0;margin-bottom:0">&nbsp;</P>
 <H2>2.4 Work Order Viewer (sys-viewer-vwrkordr)</H2>
 <H3>2.4.1 Disable Remote Tech Warning</H3>
 <P>By default, the software displays a warning message if the work order has at least one open assignment to a Remote Tech.&nbsp; The following registry setting disables the warning.</P>
 <P><FONT style="font-weight:bold; " >Setting Key:</FONT> DisableRemoteTechWarning&nbsp;<FONT style="font-weight:bold; " >Setting Value:</FONT> true</P>
 <H3>2.4.2 Credit PO Handling</H3>
 <P>One of the major differences between regular and credit POs is the posting of the Quantity Ordered and Quantity Received values.&nbsp; On a credit PO, the Quantity Received is ignored and the Quantity Ordered is used in its place.&nbsp; For example, on a regular PO the Quantity Received is posted to IMH as Quantity On-hand and to JCH as Actual Quantity.&nbsp; For credit POs, the on-hand and actual quantities are derived from the Quantity Ordered.</P>
 <P>Some customers may wish to use Quantity Received as an indicator that the vendor has actually credited them for the returned items rather than whether the Credit PO is vouchered.&nbsp; By their definition, an open credit PO is one where the Quantity Received is less than the Quantity Ordered on one or more lines.&nbsp; The following registry entry changes the definition for open Credit PO’s to be those where the Quantity Received is less then Quantity Ordered: </P>
 <P><FONT style="font-weight:bold; " >Setting Key:</FONT> CreditPOsMustBeReceived&nbsp;<FONT style="font-weight:bold; " >Setting Value:</FONT> true</P>
 <P>The default value is false so as to preserve existing behavior.&nbsp;</P>
 <H3>2.4.3 Default Quantity and Date if Inventory Item Entered first</H3>
 <P>When this option is implemented, and a new WO-INV line is started and the Inventory Item Id is entered before the Date and Quantity fields, default the Actual Quantity to 1; default the Bill Quantity to 1; and default the Date to the current system date. </P>
 <P><FONT style="font-weight:bold; " >Setting Key:</FONT> EnableCase3571 &nbsp;<FONT style="font-weight:bold; " >Setting Value:</FONT> true</P>
 <P>This option should NOT be used with the DefaultLineDateFromDateWorkCompleted=true option. If both options are set, the WO Date Work Completed is set, when you enter the Inventory Id first, the Effective Date is set to the Date Work Completed, but the quantity is not defaulted to 1.</P>
 <H3>2.4.4 Disable Posting of Budget Cost and Revenue of PM Work Orders</H3>
 <P>This registry option, when implemented, will disable the posting of job history of budget cost and budget revenue for Preventive Maintenance work orders where the work order lines are marked QU and the work order is set to Ready to Invoice. This option would be enabled if a customer wishes to enter manual budgets for PM work. Note that this option only impacts the processing of Work Order Type PreventiveMaint</P>
 <P><FONT style="font-weight:bold; " >Setting Key:</FONT> PostQuotesToJCHBudgets  <FONT style="font-weight:bold; " >Setting Value:</FONT> false</P>
 <H3>2.4.5 Other Rate Filtering</H3>
 <P>Implementing this registry option filters the Other Rates displayed on the list view to those referenced in the Job’s Rate Schedule when the user double-clicks the Other Rate Id on the Work Order’s Other tab. </P>
 <P><FONT style="font-weight:bold; " >Setting Key:</FONT> FilterOtherRatesByJobRateSchedule   <FONT style="font-weight:bold; " >Setting Value:</FONT> true</P>
 <H3>2.4.6 Allow Changes to Revenue Adjustments on PM Invoice Work Orders</H3>
 <P>When the work order's Work Type is 'PM Invoice', changes are no longer allowed by default on the Revenue Adjustments tab.&nbsp; This includes line inserts and deletes. </P>
 <P>The previous behavior (to allow changes) can be restored with the following registry setting: </P>
 <P><FONT style="font-weight:bold; " >Setting Key:</FONT> PreventRevenueAdjustmentAccessOnPMInvoices  <FONT style="font-weight:bold; " >Setting Value:</FONT> false (default true)</P>
 <H3>2.4.7  WO Inventory / IM History Alert: </H3>
 <P>This entry validates that the total cost and quantity entered directly on the tab matches the total cost and quantity what have already been or will be posted to Inventory history when the Work Order is saved. If a discrepancy is found, a TabHistoryMismatch alert box will appear, and the work order will not be saved. The tab mismatch information is written to the error log.  This alert should only appear if erroneous reversal history was previously written to Inventory History – a sporadic issue in previous images. It is only  recommended for users who are concerned with tightening up inventory, and are willing to have support correct issues before work orders can be edited/invoiced. To implement this option:</P>
 <P><FONT style="font-weight:bold; " >Setting Key:</FONT> TabMismatchINV-IMH <FONT style="font-weight:bold; " >Setting Value: </FONT>enabled </P>
 <P>If this option is not implemented this alert will not be raised. </P>

 <P><FONT style="font-weight:bold; " >I</FONT><FONT style="font-weight:bold; " >d</FONT>: sys-mapping-sagequest&nbsp; &nbsp;</P>
 <H3>2.5.1 Treat Listed Technicians as Unassigned</H3>
 <P>Sometimes users create &quot;fictitious&quot; techs to use as place holders for unassigned work orders. For example, users put a tech called PM on their D-Boards and park the PM Work Orders there for later assignment. Since the tech &quot;PM&quot; isn't a valid SageQuest driver the work order wouldn't show on the SageQuest map. This registry setting will cause any tech listed to be handled just like the work order had no tech assigned to it. Since SageQuest displays unassigned work orders, these work orders would show up with a blank tech id.</P>
 <P>This registry option will allow a user to specify a list of tech id's that SageQuest will treat the same as it treats un-assigned work orders.</P>
 <P><FONT style="font-weight:bold; " >Setting Key:</FONT> TreatAsUnassignedTech &nbsp;<FONT style="font-weight:bold; " >Setting Value:</FONT> <FONT style="font-style:italic; " >list of techs</FONT> </P>

 <H3>2.6.2 Auto-emailing:  Do Not Email User Running Report if Report Section lacks a Recipient Email Address</H3>
 <P>By default, if the User's email is completed in the User's Contact Record AND the appropriate Email To address is blank (for example, the Email Invoice Address (or Billing Address Id) in the Job is blank for service invoices), the invoice is sent to the User's Email Address in the Contact record. This may be undesirable. The following registry setting applies to auto-emailing in general and may be implemented on a report by report basis to disable the emailing of a report section when the section does NOT have a recipient email address available.</P>

 <P style="margin-left:36.00pt;"><FONT style="font-weight:bold; " >Important Note - User Viewer: Registry Tab<BR></FONT>This release implements the use of the Registry tab in the User Viewer to add / override sys-ffv-global-settings for an individual User. Since these settings are loaded when the user logs on, he or she must log on after User Registry changes are made to see them in effect.</P>
 <P><FONT style="font-weight:bold; " >Id: sys-ffv-global-settings </FONT></P>
 <H3>2.8.1  Price Code Handling Option– always default Price Code Level 1 Price</H3>
 <P>This registry entry impacts the Work Order, Quote, Client Order, and CSRAnywhere (Quote Management). Note that the Inventory Item allows for 10 levels of Material Pricing, but Price Codes only allow for 5. </P>
 <P><FONT style="font-weight:bold; " >Setting Key:</FONT> DefaultExceptionPriceCodeLevel1 &nbsp;<FONT style="font-weight:bold; " >Setting Value:</FONT> true</P>
 <P>When this option is enabled, and the system defaults inventory unit pricing and there is a Price Code in play, the system ignores the Price Level found in the Client Site or Job and assumes price level 1 of the Price Code. This setting impacts the Work Order, Quote, Client Order, and CSRAnywhere (Quote Management).  </P>
 <P>The default (if this option is NOT implemented) and Price Codes are in effect, and the default price level from the Client Site or Job is greater than 5, the system now defaults price level 1 from the Price Code. If the default Price Level (in the Site or Job) is 5 or less, the corresponding Price Code Price will be used. </P>
 <H3>2.8.2 Journals – Do not Default in Equipment Id if Work Order Id is selected – (restore default behavior)</H3>
 <P>The Equipment Id field now appears after the Work Order Id in the AP, Job, Labor and Purchase Order detail tabs. When the user enters a Work Order Id in any of these tabs, the new default behavior is for the Equipment on the first line of the Work Order’s Equipment tab to default in The following registry option may be used to disable this behavior so that the Equipment Id does NOT default in.</P>
 <P><FONT style="font-weight:bold; " >Id:</FONT> sys-ffv-global-settings</P>
 <P><FONT style="font-weight:bold; " >Setting Key:</FONT> DefaultEquipmentFromWorkOrder</P>
 <P><FONT style="font-weight:bold; " >Setting Value:</FONT> false</P>
 <P>The default is True.&nbsp; When not True, don't default in the Equipment Id.&nbsp; </P>
 <P style="margin-left:36.00pt;"><FONT style="font-weight:bold; " >Note:</FONT> If the sys-ffv-global setting 'DefaultEquipmentFromWorkorder' is set to false,  the user is now allowed to set the Equipment Id back to blank in the Labor, PO and AP Journals. If this registry option is not present or set to true, the Equipment Id must be completed if a Work Order Id is referenced. </P>
 <H3>2.8.3 Required Resources – registry entry to enable Vendor defaulting</H3>
 <P>Currently, the default Vendor (in the inventory item record) does not default when you enter a Required Resource line manually or as a result of generating a PM Work Order with flagged parts - the idea being that aggregation will be used. Customers that wish to generate individual po's for the work orders required resources (using the mat req button in the work order) must individually set the Vendor Id in each line. </P>
 <P>The following registry entry changes this behavior so that the system will default in the Vendor Id from the Inventory record (if set) on manual Work Order Required Resource entries and on Create PM Workorders.</P>
 <P><FONT style="font-weight:bold; " >Setting Key:</FONT> DefaultRequiredResourceVendorFromInventory  <FONT style="font-weight:bold; " >Setting Value:</FONT> true (default is false)</P>
 <H3>2.8.4 Specify Maximum Wait Time when Create PDF Button is Clicked</H3>
 <P>This release corrects the File Creation error sporadically experienced when using the Create PDF button in the Documents viewer or the View Files button in the Start AP Payment Approved List function waiting up to 30 seconding before the time out error is generated.  </P>
 <P>The user may also make a new entry in sys-ffv-global-settings to increase the maximum wait time if the default 30 seconds is not enough.</P>
 <P><FONT style="font-weight:bold; " >Setting Key:</FONT>  MakePDFTimeOut  </P>

 <H3>2.8.5 Internet Explorer Browser Path</H3>
 <P>This release corrects problems that occurred if the user clicked on the Preview Report option of the report range viewer and selected HTML or Text: selecting the Text option resulted in an error, selecting the HTML option did not generate an error but did not open the IE browser.</P>
 <P><FONT style="font-weight:bold; " >Important Note:</FONT></P>
 <P>For the HTLM option to work correctly, the system must be aware of the path to the IE Browser. Right click your Internet Explorer Icon select properties. The target line has the Directory Path of Internet Explorer.</P>

 <P><FONT style="font-weight:bold; " >Correction to Documentation: </FONT></P>
 <P>The<FONT style="font-weight:bold; " > </FONT>documentation for the browserpath was incorrect in previous versions of Help. It was incorrectly specified as registry id iebrowserpath and path=... as an option instead of the sys-ffv-global-setting noted above. </P>
 <H3>2.8.6 Inventory Average Cost Calculation</H3>
 <P>By default, if an Inventory Item is flagged as using Average Cost, the system will make the following attempts to determine the cost if the first option (average cost of that inventory on-hand at the specified location) is not available:</P>
 <P>1. Average from Inventory History (constrained by Where)</P>
 <P>2. Average from Inventory History (not constrained by Where)</P>
 <P>3. Standard from Inventory Item [unless the RevenueFromStandardCost registry option is enabled]</P>
 <P>4. Last from Inventory History (constrained by Where)</P>
 <P>5. Last from the Inventory Item</P>
 <P>This calculation may be quite time-consuming, and may not be the preferred methodology for all installation. The following registry entry allows the user to only make the first calculation. If there is no stock on-hand for the specified location / serial number, the cost will be zero. </P>
 <P><FONT style="font-weight:bold; " >Setting Key:</FONT> InventoryItemAverageCostByLocationOnly <FONT style="font-weight:bold; " >Setting Value:</FONT> true</P>
 <P>This registry impacts certain reports and the following screens:</P>
 <P style="margin-left:36.00pt;">Work Order Inventory Tab</P>
 <P style="margin-left:36.00pt;">Start Work Order Entry</P>
 <P style="margin-left:36.00pt;">Inventory Item: parent tab, Locations and BOM Tabs</P>

 <P style="margin-left:36.00pt;">Job Journal Expenses tab</P>
 <H3>2.8.7 Specify Standard Annual Hours for Salaried Employees</H3>
 <P>By default, the system uses the value of 2080 for the annual standard hours (for salaried employees) used for various payroll reporting calculations (such as Report PR Verification) run before (or in lieu of) Compute Payroll.  This enhancement allows the user to control the Standard Annual Hours via registry or in the Employee viewer so that the pay rate written to job history will use the ‘correct’ rate (Salary / Standard Hours) without having to run Compute Payroll to have the pay rate updated to the correct effective rate (= Salary / Pay Periods / Hours Entered). </P>
 <P><FONT style="font-weight:bold; " >Setting Key: </FONT>StandardAnnualHours&nbsp;  <FONT style="font-weight:bold; " >Setting Value:</FONT><FONT style="font-weight:bold; " > </FONT><FONT style="font-style:italic; " >NNNN</FONT></P>
 <P>Where <FONT style="font-style:italic; " >NNNN</FONT> is replaced by the number of Standard Annual Hours that your firm wishes to use. This value will be used for all employee payroll calculations unless overridden by the Annual Hours field in the Employee viewer. </P>
 <P style="margin-left:36.00pt;"><FONT style="font-weight:bold; " >Tip:</FONT> if all employees are to use the same standard annual hours (either the default 2080, or as set by global registry) you may wish to disable this field so that it is not erroneously completed. Contact your support representative for details.</P>
 <H3>2.8.8 Deny Change / Delete to Notes Unless User is a Notes Administrator</H3>
 <P>This enhancement Implements a global registry setting that prevents non-administrator users from changing or deleting Notes records.&nbsp; When this setting is ON, only a Notes Administrator account can change and delete public or private notes.</P>
 <P><FONT style="font-weight:bold; " >Setting Key:</FONT> NoteChangeDeleteRequiresAdministrator  <FONT style="font-weight:bold; " >Setting Value:</FONT> true </P>
 <P>Rules for Note Record change and delete actions are as follows ...</P>
 <P>A Notes Administrator can change/delete all but 'secure' notes. Only a support representative can delete or change secure notes. </P>
 <P>If the original author is not a Notes administrator, they can change/delete their own private and all public notes <FONT style="text-decoration:underline;" >except</FONT> when the new registry setting is in place.</P>
 <H3>2.8.9 Enable Id Search Buttons</H3>
 <P><IMG src="images/idsearch.gif" align=left border=0 height=16 width=16 alt="images\idsearch.gif"> This enhancement enables the addition of the Id Lookup button to the right-hand side of Id fields. This enhancement lets the user easily see which fields are Id fields, and also select the field AND bring up the list in a single click of the button. </P>
 <P><IMG src="images/magnify.gif" align=left border=0 height=18 width=18 alt="images\magnify.gif"> The Magnify button (used to zoom in on the Single/Detail view of lines) has been updated to help users distinguish between zooming in on a particular line, and searching for an Id (in the case of Id Search. </P>

 <H3>2.8.10 Registry Entry for Job Costing Fringe Burden</H3>
 <P>Using this option brings the Job History computation in line with the computation used in the GL History.  This is important if your firm  is not using Data-Basics Payroll module, but still desires to job cost estimated fringes and also accrue these to the general ledger.</P>
 <P><FONT style="font-weight:bold; " >Setting Key:</FONT>  LaborJobCostRateMethod&nbsp;<FONT style="font-weight:bold; " >Setting Value:</FONT>  BurdenOnWagesOnly</P>
 <P><FONT style="font-weight:bold; " >Background:</FONT></P>
 <P>An Earnings ID for a burden (type marked N/A) is setup.  This Earnings record is marked Accrue (Yes) and JobCost Labor Entry (Yes).</P>
 <P>There can be 2 different types of burden Fixed (hourly) and Flexible (percent of wages).</P>
 <P>When this registry is set the percentage is only taken on Earnings flagged as “Wages”.  The default was adding “Wages” and Fixed Burden and then calculating the percentage on these.</P>
 <P><FONT style="font-weight:bold; " >WARNING ON USING THIS PROCESS</FONT><FONT style="font-weight:bold; " >:</FONT></P>
 <P>Regardless of whether this registry option is enabled, GL will post on Labor Entry:</P>

 <P>This option provides default GL Accounts for the system to use if the corresponding fields on the Client Site PM Billing tab are blank (or are not specified in Master Contract) when Start Create PM Billing is run. One or both should be completed as follows:</P>
 <P style="margin-left:36.00pt;"><FONT style="text-decoration:underline;" >If Amortizing the Amount Earned on a Billing Schedule</FONT></P>
 <P style="margin-left:36.00pt;">The Setting Value for the DefaultGLAccountPMIncome option should specify the Income (sales or revenue) account where the Amount Earned will post.  This Account will be credited with the Amount Earned when the Start Create PM Invoice function is run.</P>
 <P style="margin-left:36.00pt;">The Setting Value for the DefaultGLAccountPMBilledInAdvance should specify the Liability (unearned income) account where the Amount Billed will post.  This Account will be credited with the Amount Billed when PM invoices are generated, printed, and posted.</P>
 <P style="margin-left:36.00pt;"><FONT style="text-decoration:underline;" >If Not Amortizing the Amount Earned on a billing schedule</FONT></P>
 <P style="margin-left:36.00pt;">The Setting Value for the DefaultGLAccountPMIncome option should specify the Income (sales or revenue) account where the Amount Billed will post.  This Account will be credited with the Amount Billed when PM invoices are generated, printed, and posted. The second GL Account field should not be completed. </P>
 <H3>2.8.12 Option to Define Statuses to Release to Tech</H3>

This enhancement allows the customization of the release to tech button located on the dispatch board and the workorder technician line to specify the &quot;from&quot; status (statuses) so that they no longer are forced to used just the status of &quot;Pending&quot;. The &quot;to&quot; status will continue to follow the same rules as it always has.</P>
 <P>Example: Setting Key: TechReleaseFromStatuses   Setting Value: pending, waitcustapprvl</P>
 <H3>2.8.13 Update Work Order Escalation Status in absence of Escalation Profile</H3>
 <P>In the past, the WO Escalation status was only updated if an Escalation Profile existed in the system. For a variety of reasons (including invoicing and credit hold processing), the WO Escalation status/Status Category should be updated for all systems. The following registry option results in the work order escalation status always being updated, regardless of whether or not an Escalation Profile exists. </P>

 <H2>2.9 TechAnywhere Registry Options</H2>
 <P><FONT style="font-weight:bold; " >Id:</FONT> sys-techanywhere</P>
 <H3>2.9.1 Do Not Post COD Work Orders to AR Sales / Cash Receipts</H3>
 <P>A new registry Item has been added to allow COD-type work orders to be invoiced from SAM Pro instead of occurring as part of the TechAnywhere post. This allows the back office staff to review the Tech Anywhere COD Invoices before posting to AR. </P>
 <P><FONT style="font-weight:bold; " >Setting Key:</FONT> AutoPostCOD&nbsp;<FONT style="font-weight:bold; " >Setting Value:</FONT> false or true</P>
 <P>The default is true. If the option is absent or set to true, the current default is retained: the post will create an Invoice, AR Sales Journal, and Cash Receipt.</P>
 <P>When the Setting Value is false, the behavior is completely changed. An invoice master record is still created, but now left at the status of New, and no AR Sales Journal or Cash Receipt is created. All imported lines come in without an AR invoice reference ID so that they can be billed normally via Service Compute. AR entries can then be created through SAMPro.</P>
 <H3>2.9.2 Adjust Default Date or Accounting Period </H3>
 <P>Inventory from TechAnywhere can be posted to the default accounting period, even if the effective date is outside of the period range. However, a problem occurs when the user attempts to bill the WO and encounters an error indicating that the effective date was out of period range. A registry entry is now available to adjust either the date or accounting period to keep them in sync.&nbsp; </P>
 <P>When the defaulted Date and Accounting Period are NOT out-of-sync, NO adjustments are made to the defaulted values.&nbsp; The rules noted below are used only when an adjustment is necessary.</P>
 <P><FONT style="font-weight:bold; " >Setting Key:</FONT> AdjustDefaultDateOrPeriod   <FONT style="font-weight:bold; " >Setting Value:</FONT> period  or date</P>
 <P>If period is selected, the Accounting Period table is queried for eligible Accounting Periods.&nbsp; To qualify, the period must be Active and its date range must include the defaulted Effective Date.&nbsp; When multiple periods are eligible, the one with the smallest Period Id is chosen to become the new Accounting Period for the current transaction.&nbsp; If no eligible period is found, nothing is changed.</P>
 <P>If date is selected, the Effective Date is adjusted to be either the Start Date or the End Date of the defaulted Accounting Period.&nbsp; The Start Date is chosen when the current date is less than the Start Date.&nbsp; The End Date is chosen when the current date is greater than the End Date.</P>
 <P>NOTE: the current TechAnywhere post behavior does not change unless the new registry setting is turned on.&nbsp;</P>

 <P>In the second option, specify a Cost Category Id to be used with the Other Items on the PM Parts list. </P>
 <P>Also, if PM WO’s are being generated that HAVE required resources, the work order status will be Waiting Parts. This will override any entries made in the sys-web-access registry entries. </P>
 <H3>2.11.2 Do Not Write Required Resources to PM Work Orders </H3>
 <P>If your firm uses required resources, the following new registry may be used to prevent the writing of PM parts to the Required Resources tab for non-subcontractor technician (Required Resource lines are <FONT style="font-weight:bold; text-decoration:underline;" >never</FONT> written if the PM is created for a subcontractor technician):</P>
 <P>Id: sys-start-scrtepmwo</P>
 <P>Setting Key: DisableReqPMParts&nbsp; Setting Value: true  (default is false)</P>
 <P>This registry entry only controls the writing of flagged service parts to the Required Resources tab. The TechServiceParts option is used to determine whether flagged parts will <FONT style="font-weight:bold; text-decoration:underline;" >also</FONT> be written to </P>
 <P style="margin-left:36.00pt;">The Inventory,/Other tabs as quoted lines (TechServiceParts=Yes or if the option is absent)</P>
 <P style="margin-left:36.00pt;">The Work Order Equipment Work Requested (TechServiceParts=Sub)</P>
 <P style="margin-left:36.00pt;">No additional lines written (TechServiceParts=No)</P>
 <P>The above options control the behavior of flagged service parts if the technician is not a subcontractor or if a technician is not assigned. Flagged service parts are always written to the Work Order Equipment Work Requested for subcontractor techs. </P>
 <H3>2.11.3 Allow Multiple Work Codes Per Work Order</H3>
 <P>In version 7.2.476.071, we corrected a bug so that, if the Work Code Id is different on two lines of the Client Site Equipment PM Schedule for the same day and technician, the system  forces a separate work order to be created. Since some users prefer to have PM lines with multiple work codes appear on the same work order, the following registry entry is now available:</P>

 <P>This option should be set to false if the WO Other to GL box should never be checked.&nbsp; The user will be unable to save the record with the Inventory to GL box checked.</P>
 <P>If this option is not implemented, the system will not alert the user regardless of the status of the WO Other To GL box. </P>

 <H3>2.16.1 MICR Support for Multiple Bank Accounts / Entities</H3>
 <P>This release extends MICR check printing to handle multiple bank accounts / entities. The UseMICR option has been extended to PR check registry entries of the following forms:</P>
 <P><FONT style="font-weight:bold; " >Registry Id:  </FONT></P>
 <P><FONT style="font-weight:bold; " >sys-report-rprchck</FONT><FONT style="font-weight:bold; font-style:italic; " >-GLACCTID-GLENTTYID </FONT></P>

 <P><FONT style="font-weight:bold; " >Setting Key:</FONT> UseMICR&nbsp;<FONT style="font-weight:bold; " >Setting Option:</FONT> yes</P>
 <P>Now the PR Check Entry Fields GL Account and GL Entity are used to look up the registry; if not found the default (sys-report-rprchck) is used. In this way you can assign different MICR values to each GL Account/Entity combination.</P>
 <H3>2.16.2 Suppress PTO Section on Check Stubs</H3>

 <H2>2.18 Registry to Set the Child Tab Label Fonts</H2>
 <P>This setting may be used to adjust the fonts used for the child tab labels in SAM Pro viewers. This was implemented for use with the Work Order (and other viewers with MANY tabs) for systems with lower resolution screens. By selecting a ‘skinnier’ font or lower point size, these tabs will now be available for users with lower-resolution screens. Previously, the only way of handling this was to suppress tabs or shorten their names via registry. This was not desirable since, if a new tab was added to SAM Pro, it would not appear unless the existing registry was altered. </P>

 <H2>2.20 Registry to Set Title Font</H2>
 <P>In previous releases, the registry entry (sys-font-title) used to specify the font for labeling titles and lists was restricted to a 10 point fixed width font. Changes to the way in which the titles are constructed means the registry is no longer limited to fixed-width fonts or a 10 point font size. </P>

 <H2>2.21 Inventory Restock (sys-viewer-vrstck)</H2>
 <P>In previous releases, the system deleted closed (completed) Inventory Restock transactions. This resulted in a lack of an appropriate audit trial for this function. The default in this release is to not delete restock records when they are closed.</P>
 <P>To set the software to re-enable deletion for closed entries, set the following registry entry:</P>

 <P style="margin-left:36.00pt;">Red: More than 4 hours currently scheduled</P>
 <P style="margin-left:36.00pt;">Gray: weekend day</P>
 <P>This enhancement enables the user to set up to 5 work order hour cut offs and associated colors for use in the Tech Finder assigned hours section. </P>

 <H2>2.30 Service Channel - New Registry Entries for Multi-Company Use</H2>
 <H3>Purpose: </H3>
 <P>Invoices are uploaded to ServiceChannel by sending them an email with an attached spreadsheet. For each work order, the spreadsheet includes a User Id and a password. Previously, the User Id and password were derived from the Sampro Registry sys-fmms-vendor-servicechannel, supporting only a single User Id and password contained in the registry entry. This results in the sending of the same User Id/Password pair for every work order regardless of the Sampro 'company'.<BR><BR>This procedure has been enhanced so that User Id/Password used is dependent on the corresponding work order. This release provides a mechanism for implementing multiple User Id/Password pairs when uploading invoices to ServiceChannel. The technique used is to provide for PIN based overrides in the Sampro ‘sys-fmms-vendor-servicechannel’ registry entry.<BR><BR>It work likes this:<BR>•&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The entire registry entry is retrieved from the Sampro Registry for the ‘sys-fmms-vendor-servicechannel’ key as usual.<BR>•&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The entire registry entry is retrieved from the Sampro Registry for the ‘sys-fmms-vendor-servicechannel-pin-XXXX’ key (where ‘XXXX’ is the pin identified by the work order).<BR>•&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The two entries are merged. Where there are duplicate entries, the second pin based registry takes precedence.<BR><BR>To implement the correct User Id/Password uploading for multi-company users, you must create a ‘sys-fmms-vendor-servicechannel-pin-XXXX’ for each company’s pin. The only lines needed are the InvoiceUID and InvoicePWD lines. For single company users, the invoiceUID and InvoicePWD lines can remain in the normal 'sys-fmms-vendor-servicechannel' registry entry.</P>
 <H3>Important Fields:</H3>
 <P><FONT style="font-weight:bold; " >Id:</FONT> sys-fmms-vendor-servicechannel-pin-<FONT style="font-style:italic; " >XXXX</FONT></P>
 <P>Where <FONT style="font-style:italic; " >XXXX</FONT> is replaced by the PIN provided by Service Channel.  Note that individual registry entries must be created for all applicable PIN’s. </P>
 <H3>Required Settings for Multi-Company Use:</H3>

 <H2>2.31 Registry Option to Restrict Inactive Quotes</H2>

 <H2>2.32 Registry Options for Bitmap ‘skins’</H2>
 <P>Version 7.3 supports a new and brighter look for SAM Pro via bitmap ‘skinning’ of the top and side button bars.  These newer bitmaps are also designed to display more clearly on today’s high-resolution monitors. To implement this look requires a few simple registry settings and the set of SKIN1 bitmaps from Data-Basics. If you have been using SAM Pro for many years, this may feel like a big change, but once you start using the new bitmaps you will be surprised by how quickly you adapt to and enjoy using them. </P>

 <H2>2.33 Purchase Order </H2>
 <H3>Allow PO Type Change on Existing Record</H3>
 <P>In previous releases, users had the ability to go into purchase orders and change them from purchase orders to credit purchase orders and vice versa without any checks or tests. This had more impact on clients using the Unvouchered Option in the Accounting period as it produce an out-of-balance gl transaction. In this release, validation has been added to lock this down. If the PO is in add mode, the user is allowed to switch between the Purchase and Credit types. Once the record has been added, however, the user must cancel the PO, and add it as the correct type. </P>
 <P>A registry entry (not recommended) is available to ignore this validation and restore the previous behavior and allow the PO Type to be changed on existing Purchase Orders: </P>

It would be used to make this process act like a 3<FONT style="vertical-align:super; " >rd</FONT> approval function so that invoices approved in this fashion are NOT paid as part of the normal AP Check printing process (because the date is set so far in the future). To pay these checks, a cash manager would run AP Date to Pay, filtering on the date referenced in this entry in the Next Pay Date range. The cash manager could then review the entries, and select an appropriate Pay Date. </P>

 <H1>3. AP and Purchasing</H1>
 <H2>3.1 Recurring AP Journal </H2>
 <P>This release corrects the calculation of the Recurring Lines Amount field based on the Quantity and Cost; previously, this calculation only supported Amounts under 100.00. </P>
 <P>Previously, we enabled the IgnoreCase3193 registry option to allow users to enter (among other things) a bank account on the Recurring AP Journal Recurring Lines tab to support credit card/eft processing. In earlier versions, the Release Recurring AP Journal function did not evaluate this setting, and the post failed if a bank (or other denied) account was found. This problem has been corrected so the Release function successfully evaluates the sys-viewer-vrcrrngapjrnl for the IgnoreCase3193 option. </P>
 <P>Validation has been added to prevent the entry of negative amounts in the following fields to prevent errors when these entries are released:</P>
 <P style="margin-left:36.00pt;">Main Tab: Recurring Amount:</P>
 <P style="margin-left:36.00pt;">Recurring Lines Tab: Quantity, Quantity Billable, Unit Cost, Amount, Revenue Rate, Amount Revenue</P>
 <P>By default, the system prohibits the entry of AR Control, AP Control &amp; Bank accounts on GEN lines. Some users have found that these validations conflict with their internal processing procedures: the registry entry detailed in user note 2.34 may be implemented turn the default error behavior into a warning. </P>
 <P>This release<FONT style="font-weight:bold; " > </FONT>corrects sporadic problem in Inventory History if an AP Journal entry for a PO referencing a Work Order with a difference location is deleted. </P>
 <P>Validation has been added to not allow the record to be saved if the GL Bank Account field is completed and the Type ‘Check” is selected. </P>
 <P>Corrects a problem with releasing entries if an Other Rate Id with a blank Job Cost Category was specified on the Recurring Lines tab. </P>
 <P>Corrects an intermittent issue where the Check record was not always created for EFT or Credit Card transactions. </P>
 <H3>3.1.1 Main Tab</H3>
 <P><FONT style="font-weight:bold; " >New Field: Day (0-31</FONT><FONT style="font-weight:bold; " >) </FONT><BR>This new field enables the user to select the day of the month that will be used as the effective date for AP Journal entries generated from this record. Validation ensures that the Day value is not greater than 31.</P>
 <P style="margin-left:36.00pt;">The Start Release Recurring AP function has been enhanced to use the new value, if one is specified.&nbsp; If the Day value is zero, then the existing code works as is, and the Effective Day of the generated AP Entry will be set from the Effective Date in the Release Recurring Journal range screen as in previous releases.&nbsp; </P>
 <P style="margin-left:36.00pt;">If the Days value is not zero, the Days value will override the Effective Date of the release function.  If this date doesn't fit within the Accounting Period Start/End Dates (for example, you are releasing AP Journals for February, and the Days field is set to 31), then the system will adjust the Date to fit (e.g., February 28 or 29).</P>
 <H2>3.2 AP Check </H2>
 <P>Corrects problem related to the Remit To address in the Purchase Order. </P>
 <P>The Start and End dates have been promoted to being the first fields on the AP Check Range screen.  </P>
 <P><FONT style="font-weight:bold; " >Range Screen</FONT><FONT style="font-weight:bold; " > - </FONT><FONT style="font-weight:bold; " > New Range: Invoice No:<BR></FONT>This new range allows the SAMPRO user to print a check for a single vendor's invoice (or list of invoices) even though other invoices for the same vendor have the same Date to Pay.</P>
 <H2>3.3 Start PWP Billed Approval </H2>
 <P>This function no longer skips records with a zero total cost, hours or total revenue. </P>
 <H2>3.4 Void AP Checks</H2>
 <P>Validation has been added to prevent the user from voiding reconciled AP checks. In previous releases, the user was warned that a check was reconciled, but could in fact complete the void process. </P>
 <H2>3.5 Purchase Order</H2>
 <P>In previous releases, users had the ability to go into purchase orders and change them from purchase orders to credit purchase orders and vice versa without any checks or tests. This had more impact on clients using the Unvouchered Option in the Accounting period as it produce an out-of-balance gl transaction. In this release, validation has been added to lock this down. If the PO is in add mode, the user is allowed to switch between the Purchase and Credit types. Once the record has been added, however, the user must cancel the PO, and add it as the correct type. See user note 2.33 for a registry entry (not recommended) to ignore this validation.  </P>
 <P>See section 3.10 for changes related to the new Purchase Control enhancements in this release. </P>
 <P>Unless disabled by registry, the first Equipment Id from the referenced Work Order defaults in PO detail lines. In previous releases, this resulted in the first Equipment Id from the Work Order being reloaded if the user changed the Job Cost Code or Billing Item AFTER specifying a different Equipment Id. This has been corrected so that the existing Equipment Id will not be changed when selecting a different Billing Item or Job Cost Code. </P>
 <P>When adding a Purchase Order, the system will compare the Release Date with the PO header Job’s Date Closed. If the Release Date exceeds the Job’s Date Closed, the Purchase Order will not be saved. Note that if the Release Date is not completed, the system date will be used for the comparison.&nbsp;</P>
 <P>The user is now prevented from setting the PO Date Closed prior to the PO's creation date. </P>
 <P>Credit PO's (both vouchered and not yet vouchered) can now be un-received (previously, only vouchered Credit PO’s could be un-received). </P>
 <P>Previously, when a stock PO was created a Job Cost Category (but no Job), spurious job history with a committed cost and quantity (but no Job) was generated. In this release, changes to the Purchase Order, AP Journal and Inventory Receipts journals have been made to correct this problem. </P>
 <P>If the sys-ffv-global setting 'DefaultEquipmentFromWorkorder' is set to false,  the user is now allowed to set the Equipment Id back to blank in the Labor, PO and AP Journals. If this registry option (see user note 2.8.2) is not present or set to true, the Equipment Id must be completed if a Work Order Id is referenced. </P>
 <H3>3.5.1 Sub Tab</H3>
 <P>The system now allows negative Contract values on subcontractor lines. The system will warn the user when a negative value is entered, but will allow the PO to be saved. </P>
 <H3>3.6.1 Main Tab </H3>
 <P><FONT style="font-weight:bold; " >New Field – Job Tax Status:<BR></FONT>This display-only field has been added to the Main tab. The value is derived from the Job / Work Order entered in the PO header. </P>
 <H2>3.6 Report Purchase Order</H2>
 <P>Corrects display problem with extended price of Inventory on the printed purchase order. </P>
 <H2>3.7 AP Journal </H2>
 <P>This release corrects a Key is Missing error that occurred when the user attempted to delete a Material Returns line from an existing Credit Memo. </P>
 <P>In this enhancement, the AP Journal Entry Type (Purchase or Credit Memo) has been added as a column to all of the list options for this viewer. </P>
 <P>The registry option AttachCostsToARInvoiceForWO allows the user to attach vendor costs to AR Invoices when vouchering. In this release, attachment (whether manual or automatic) is no longer made to reversed AR Invoices.</P>
 <P>When attempting to delete a journal entry, the system now checks the status of the Accounting Period earlier in the process. This prevents inappropriate changes to the Check records of manual checks and credit card transactions associated with AP Journal entries for inactive accounting periods. </P>
 <P>If a manual check is entered, and then deleted, and the user elects to reuse check#, the system will now allow the number to be reused.  </P>
 <P>Validation has been added to prohibit the entry of AR Control, AP Control &amp; Bank accounts on GEN lines. A registry entry may be used to disable this validation (see user note 2.12). </P>
 <P>This viewer now supports the verification of reconciled check entries for multiple bank accounts.</P>
 <P>If the sys-ffv-global setting 'DefaultEquipmentFromWorkorder' is set to false,  the user is now allowed to set the Equipment Id back to blank in the Labor, PO and AP Journals. If this registry option (see user note 2.8.2) is not present or set to true, the Equipment Id must be completed if a Work Order Id is referenced. </P>
 <H3>3.7.1  Main Tab</H3>

 <H2>3.8 Preliminary Project Manager Approval of Held Vendor Invoices</H2>
 <H3>3.8.1 Overview</H3>
 <P>This functionality enables your Project Managers to give preliminary approval to ‘requires approval’ Vendor Invoices either from the Project Managers Workbench, or via the new starter function Start AP Payment Approved List PM. Once approved by the Project Manager, these invoices will then be eligible for final approval during the standard AP Approve HELD Invoices (Start AP Payment Approved List) processing.</P>
 <P style="margin-left:36.00pt;"><FONT style="font-weight:bold; " >Important Note:</FONT> If a Vendor Invoice is eligible for Project Manager Approval, it MUST be approved</P>
 <P style="margin-left:36.00pt;">First by the Project Manager (using the new Starter Function Start AP Payment Approved List PM or the Project Manager’s Workbench) <FONT style="font-weight:bold; " >AND</FONT></P>
 <P style="margin-left:36.00pt;">Second by the supervisor running AP Payment Approved List </P>
 <H3>3.8.2 Registry Option to Enable Project Manager Approval</H3>
 <P>New Registry Option to Require Preliminary Project Manager Approval of Vendor Invoices: </P>
 <P>Id: sys-ffv-global-settings<BR>Setting Key: ProjectManagerMustApproveVendorPayments&nbsp; Setting Value: true  (default is false)</P>
 <P>This is option is required to enable your Project Managers to give preliminary approval to ‘requires approval’ Vendor Invoices. Once approved by the Project Manager, these invoices will then be eligible for final approval during the standard AP Approve HELD Invoices (Start AP Payment Approved List) functionality.</P>
 <P style="margin-left:36.00pt;"><FONT style="font-weight:bold; " >NOTE: </FONT>AutoReleaseHeldVouchers and ProjectManagerMustApproveVendorPayments should <FONT style="font-weight:bold; " >NOT</FONT> be implemented  simultaneously.&nbsp; If they are, the AutoReleaseHeldVouchers entry CONTINUES to rule the approval process, negating the whole purpose of Project Manager Approval.</P>
 <P>Preliminary PM Approval applies in the following situations: </P>
 <P style="margin-left:36.00pt;">1. New registry setting noted above is in place.</P>
 <P style="margin-left:36.00pt;">2. Vendor Invoice must reference a PO that links to a job that has a Project Manager assigned to it.</P>
 <P style="margin-left:36.00pt;">3. Vendor Invoice must be 'on hold'.&nbsp; (Use AP Terms Codes wisely)</P>
 <H3>3.8.3 New Function: Start AP Payment Approved List PM</H3>
 <P><FONT style="font-weight:bold; " >Recent Update: </FONT>This function matches the Vendor AP invoices for a job with the corresponding AR invoices for a job.&nbsp; However, if the AP invoice had a blank job, it was matching it with AR invoices with blank jobs. In this release, the system restricts the amount collected in AR to history where the Job is specified. </P>
 <H3>Purpose:</H3>
 <P>This function enables Project Managers to give preliminary approval to ‘requires approval’ Vendor Invoices.  Once approved by the Project Manager, these invoices will then be eligible for final approval during the standard AP Approve HELD Invoices (Start AP Payment Approved List) processing.</P>
 <H3>Usage:</H3>
 <P>To be eligible for PM Approval a Vendor Invoice must be 'on hold' AND Reference a PO that links to a job that has a Project Manager assigned to it. Only those invoices associated with the Project Manager running this function will appear on the list.</P>
 <P>In addition, the registry option described in release note 3.8.2 must be in place.</P>

 <H2>3.9 Reorder Advice Report</H2>
 <P>In previous releases, quantities on order/received were not handled correctly if a PO was subsequently turned into a Change Order. In this release,  PO-related data is correctly  combined by Base PO Id. This report is part of SAM Pro and does not been to be imported. </P>
 <H2>3.10 Purchase Controls - Enhancement</H2>
 <P>New fields added to the Vendor, Insurance, and User records allows dollar limits to be placed on release purchase orders created by specific users, a PO Limit per Work Order, and the ability to block the release of PO for Vendors with expired Insurance. </P>
 <H3>3.10.1 Insurance Viewer </H3>
 <H3>New Field: Block Purchases</H3>
 <P>If this field is flagged, and the Vendor’s Insurance is expired, a PO for this vendor may only be saved as Unreleased. The PO cannot be released until the Vendor’s insurance is renewed, and the Vendor’s Insurance Tab entries are updated. Note that today’s date is compared with the Start and End Dates on the Vendor Insurance tab in order to determine if the Insurance is expired. This prevents new PO’s from being backdated to when the insurance was in effect. </P>
 <P>Note that this field is also displayed on the Vendor Insurance Tab, and the Purchase Order Main tab. </P>
 <H3>3.10.2 Vendor Viewer</H3>
 <P>Two new tabs, Defaults and User Fields, have been added to the parent select of the Vendor viewer. Several existing fields from the Main and Contacts tabs have been moved the Defaults tab for better organization. </P>
 <P><FONT style="font-weight:bold; " >Defaults Tab </FONT><FONT style="font-weight:bold; " >New Field: PO Limit per WO</FONT></P>
 <P>This field comes into play if a WorkOrder Id is specified in the PO header. If this field is blank, this Vendor is not subject to a dollar limit on the PO. If this field is completed, only PO’s under this limit can be released. Note that the system checks the dollar value of all PO’s for this Vendor/WO combination when testing to see if the PO Limit is exceeded. In order to release the PO, this field must be edited in the Vendor record by a user with the authority to do so.</P>
 <P style="margin-left:36.00pt;"><FONT style="font-weight:bold; " >NOTE:</FONT> the dollar amount of the released PO may also be limited by the MAX PO Amount found in the User record.  </P>
 <H3>3.10.3 User Viewer – Registry Tab</H3>
 <P>This release implements the use of the Registry tab in the User Viewer to add / override sys-ffv-global-settings for this User. Since these settings are loaded when the user logs on, he or she must log on after User Registry changes are made to see them in effect.</P>
 <P>In addition to global settings, the following option is designed specifically for use on this tab. </P>
 <H3>User Registry Option to Specify Maximum Dollar Amount of Released PO’s.  </H3>
 <P>Key: maxpoamount&nbsp;Value: limit in dollars</P>
 <P>If this User Registry entry not implemented (and the User is flagged as a Purchasing Agent), the user is not limited to the dollar amount of a PO that he can save as Released. </P>
 <P>If this User Registry is implemented for a User flagged as a Purchasing agent, the PO cannot be released if the PO amount exceeds this field; the PO must be saved as Unreleased. A User (who is also a Purchase Agent) with a higher maxpoamount can edit and release the PO in this situation.</P>
 <P>Example: To specify a $600 maximum release PO limit for this User:</P>
 <P>User Registry: Key: maxpoamount  Value: 600</P>
 <P>NOTE: the dollar amount of the released PO may also be limited by the PO Limit per WO found in the Vendor record.  </P>
 <H3>3.10.4 Purchase Order – Status Tab</H3>
 <P><FONT style="font-weight:bold; " >New Fields:</FONT></P>
 <P><FONT style="font-weight:bold; " >User PO Limit:<BR></FONT>This display field defaults from the maxpoamount  key value on the User’s Registry tab. If this field is completed and the user is flagged as a Purchase Agent, it represents the maximum dollar amount of a PO that the user can save as released. If this limit is exceeded, the PO may be saved as Unreleased. A User with a higher PO limit can then edit and release the Purchase Order.</P>
 <P>If this field is blank, a User PO Limit is not in effect. </P>
 <P><FONT style="font-weight:bold; " >Vendor PO Limit per WO:<BR></FONT>This display field defaults from the PO Limit per WO field in the Vendor record. If the field is blank, a PO Limit per WO is not in effect.</P>
 <P><FONT style="font-weight:bold; " >Vendor WO Total (Other PO’s):</FONT><FONT style="font-weight:bold; " ><BR></FONT>This display field is calculated by the system, and shows the total of all other PO’s for this Vendor which reference the same header WO Id as in this PO. If the dollar amount of this field plus the total dollar amount of this PO exceeds the Vendor PO Limit per WO, the PO can only be saved as Unreleased. </P>
 <H2>3.11 Start Create EOM Unvouchered AP GL Entries:</H2>
 <P>In previous releases, this function skipped GEN lines from Credit PO’s but picked up Inventory lines.  In this release, applicable Inventory and Gen lines on Credit PO’s lines will be processed. </P>
 <P style="margin-top:0;margin-bottom:0">&nbsp;</P>
 <H1>4. Client, Site, Equipment</H1>
 <H2>4.1 Client Site Equipment </H2>
 <P>An additional 10 Client Site Equipment User fields have been added to the User Fields tab, for a total of 20. </P>
 <P>A new field, Deny TA Access, has been added to the Main tab. An RAQ may be implemented to deny TechAnywhere users access to this equipment if the Deny TA Access box is checked. Note that a new v.cus is required in order to see the new field.</P>
 <P>An obsolete field, Calendar Base Year, has been removed from Service tab. Users may need a new v.cus to see this change. </P>
 <H2>4.2 Client Site</H2>
 <P>In previous releases, the Client Site User 1 and 2 fields appeared on both the COP and User Field tabs. They are now only on the User Field tab as they should be.</P>
 <H3>4.2.1 Main Tab</H3>
 <P>The Call Script Id field on the Main tab has been relabeled to reflect its function: WO Closing Call Script id. </P>
 <P><FONT style="font-weight:bold; " >Changed Fields - Longitude and Latitude:</FONT><FONT style="font-weight:bold; " ><BR></FONT>These fields were previously display-only. They have been exposed to enable the user to manually enter appropriate values. </P>
 <H3>4.2.2 PM Billing Tab</H3>
 <P>A registry entry is now available to provide default Income and Accrual GL Accounts that will be used if they are not completed on this tab. See user note 4.2.2 for details. </P>
 <P style="background-color:#fbfbfb; ">The PM Billing tab now has a full screen view, accessible by clicking the Magnify button. </P>
 <P>The PM Billing Schedule should now be used as the one-and-only source for PM Billing information.&nbsp; Other Master Contract entries continue to generated to this tab, contract changes, credit memos, revised billing, etc are now all manageable from this tab. The following enhancements provide the user with means to do so. </P>
 <P><FONT style="font-weight:bold; " >Enhanced Fields: Amt to Bill:  Amt to Earn:<BR></FONT>These fields (previously Bill Amount and Amount Earn) now allow entry of negative values. This allows users to effectively reverse errors in billing and amortization by adding a new line (with the appropriate negative values). After running Compute PM billing, the user should then print the negative dollar invoice (it will use the Client Site PM Billing line as the ‘source journal’). Note that validation prevents the entry of both positive and negative contract amounts on the same line. The entry of negative amounts is denied on lines flagged as 'renewable'.</P>
 <P>When the Start PM Billing function is run, negative Amt to Earn (amortization) lines will result in a GL Journal entry with a negative debit to the accrued expenses account (the GL Debit account) and a negative credit to the sales accrued (the GL Credit account). </P>
 <P><FONT style="font-weight:bold; " >Changed Fields: Renewable Billings: Renewable Earnings:<BR></FONT>These display-only fields appear at the top of the PM Billing tab, and were previously labeled ‘Total Billings’ and ‘Total Earnings’.<FONT style="font-weight:bold; " > </FONT>They display the running total of the Amount to Invoice and Amount Earned of all lines marked as 'Ok to Renew' and have been relabeled to clarify their functionality.   </P>
 <P><FONT style="font-weight:bold; " >Changed Field: Date:<BR></FONT>In previous versions, this field was labeled ‘Bill Date’. The label has been changed to ‘Date.’ </P>
 <P><FONT style="font-weight:bold; " >Changed Field:</FONT> <FONT style="font-weight:bold; " >PM Inv No:<BR></FONT>This field was previously labeled Invoice Nu; the label has been changed for clarity. </P>

 <P style="margin-left:36.00pt;">When the PM Invoice No. field is blank, the Invoice Status is blank.<BR>When a valid PM Invoice Id is shown, the Invoice Status comes from the associated Invoice Master record.<BR>If the PM Invoice Id cannot be found in the Invoice Master table, the Invoice Status displays 'unknown'.</P>
 <P><FONT style="font-weight:bold; " >New Field: GLJ Trx Id:<BR></FONT>This display-only field lists the GL Transaction Id of amortized lines that have been posted to GL. </P>
 <P style="margin-left:36.00pt;">If the line's amortization amount (Amt to Earn) is zero, the GLJ Trx Id displays 'n/a'.</P>
 <P style="margin-left:36.00pt;">When the line has an Earn amount but the posted-to-gl flag is false, the Trx Id display is blank.</P>
 <P style="margin-left:36.00pt;">If the system fails to find a qualifying transaction, the Trx Id display reads 'unknown'.</P>
 <P style="margin-left:36.00pt;">If multiple amortizations for the same accounting period have been made for the same job, only the most recent GLJ Transaction will be listed. If this is the case, the GLJ Transaction will be followed by an asterisk, indicated that multiple transactions exist. </P>

 <P><FONT style="font-weight:bold; " >New Field: </FONT><FONT style="font-weight:bold; " >Work Order Id:<BR></FONT>This field has been added to the detail view (accessed with the Magnify button) of these lines.

 <P>These labels have been changed to better define their function.</P>
 <H2>4.3  Start Client Site Import</H2>
 <H3>Purpose:</H3>
 <P>This function allows a user to import a pre-defined, comma separated ASCII file containing information needed to create new records and relationships between Clients, Client Sites, Client Site Equipment, Jobs, Cost Codes and Billing Items in the database.  When the import function is run, the system will create a new Client Site along with one or more Client Site Equipment records referencing a newly created Job/Cost Code/Billing Item and Client combination based on the specified Client Id and Job Id used for cloning an existing relationship. </P>
 <P>If any errors occur during the import (i.e. invalid Client, Job or other referenced table values) the entire import process will abort and an error report will be generated specifying what problems were experienced during the import. The user can then re-attempt the import after the errors are corrected.</P>
 <H3>Registry:</H3>
 <P>When this function is run, SAM Pro will open a browser window so that you may select the appropriate .cvs file for importing your client site data. </P>
 <P>Registry Option to Specify Directory for CSV Site Import Files</P>
 <P>Id: sys-start-Sclntsteimprt<BR>Key: CSVDirectory=C:\ClientSites (A directory to place CSV files)</P>
 <H3>Usage:</H3>
 <P>The .csv file must contain a valid Client Id and Job Id (per row of data) that the system can use as a model for cloning. Any other fields from the Client Site record (parent only) may be specified in the file layout. Any specified field values that reference a table other than the Client Site must be valid values in the database. For example, if the Account Manager Id “Tim” is specified in the file layout then “Tim” must exist in the Account Manager table prior to importing the file.</P>
 <P>Please contact your support representative for suggestions on managing your import file to ensure that dates and other fields are formatted correctly. </P>
 <P>Imported data must be formatted as follows:</P>

 <H1>5. Invoicing and AR Related</H1>
 <H2>5.1 Revenue Adjustments</H2>
 <P>In previous versions, the Revenue Adjustment Table only supported Discounts for Labor, Material, Subcontract, Total, and Exception entries. A new field, Rate Type, has been added to the Revenue Adjustment Table (and it’s Labor, Inventory and Other Exception tabs). The Rate Type field has two options, Add and Deduct. These options enable the user to choose whether the percentage will be handled as a deduction (discount) or addition when the Adjust Revenue functionality is invoked in Work Orders and Quotes. </P>
 <P>During data conversion from a previous release, existing Rate’s will be assigned the Rate Type of Deduct so that they will continue to be handled as discounts. </P>
 <P>Note: the user was already allowed to manually select Add or Deduct on the Revenue Adjustment tab of Work Orders and Quotes. This enhancement extends this functionality to system-generated lines. </P>

 <P>Rounding logic has been added to retainage calculations. This should correct sporadic problems where the retainage was off by a penny or two.   </P>
 <P>If the user clears the Next Invoice Id field, they are now asked if they meant to clear the field (Click Yes), or if was cleared in error (Click No to restore the field’s original contents). </P>
 <H2>5.3 Sales Summary By Sales Rep Report</H2>
 <H3>Purpose: </H3>
 <P>This report lists Sales and Quota information for your Sales Reps for the selected month (current and previous year), as well as year to date figures for the current and previous sales year. </P>
 <H3>Report Description:<FONT style="font-size:9pt; color:black; " > </FONT></H3>
 <P>The <FONT style="text-decoration:underline;" >Quota</FONT> information on the report is obtained from the Sales Commission History Table: this includes entries generated from the Sales Rep viewer’s Quota tab, as well as manual entries made to the Sales Commission History table.</P>
 <P>The <FONT style="text-decoration:underline;" >Sales</FONT> information on the report is obtained from Job History (the Job Invoice Amount is used to determine the total Sales amount) and the Job’s Commission tab (the Share % will be used to calculate how the Job Invoice Amount should be allocated among the Sales Rep’s if more than one is listed on the Job’s Commission tab).  </P>
 <P>The first page(s) list quota and sales dollars and percentages, broken down by Sales Rep and Job Type.</P>
 <P>The last page provides a summary by Job Type for all Sales Reps included on the report.</P>
 <H3>Report Format:</H3>
 <P style="margin-top:0;margin-bottom:0">                        &nbsp;&nbsp;Current Month&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Year to Date&nbsp;</P>

 <H2>5.4 Payment Type Viewer</H2>
 <P><FONT style="font-weight:bold; " >New Field:  GL Bank Account Id:<BR></FONT>This field may be completed for Payment Types associated with COD payments. When a Payment Type is selected on the Work Order COD parent or child tab (or posted from TechAnywhere), the GL Bank Account specified in this viewer will be defaulted in. Note that the Work Order will deny changes to the GL Bank Account on the COD data entry forms when it has defaulted from the Payment Type</P>
 <H2>5.5 AR Sales Journal</H2>
 <P>Corrects a sporadic problem using the Create Credit Memo Button for a COP posting where the line amounts did not total correctly.</P>
 <P>Updated buttons that are easier to read on high-resolution monitors have been added to the Main tab: </P>
 <P style="margin-left:36.00pt;"><IMG src="images/showinvoice_new.gif" border=0 height=28 width=94 alt="images\showinvoice_new.gif"> <IMG src="images/createcreditmemo.gif" border=0 height=28 width=94 alt="images\createcreditmemo.gif"> </P>
 <P>This release incorporates enhanced validation to deny changes to the Invoice Id for previously posted AR Sales entries and to insure that the specified Invoice Id must be appropriate for users’ security settings.</P>
 <P>This release closes a loophole that allowed users to overwrite an existing Invoice Master record when crediting a Credit Memo without using the Credit Memo button. </P>
 <P>Creating a Credit Memo from an existing Sales Journal entry now clears the Cost Billed on the child tab when the Create CM button is used. </P>
 <P>Validation has been added to prohibit the entry of AP Control accounts on Prices lines.</P>
 <P>Previously, we added a warning when the user clicked the Create CM button if the invoice balance did not equal the invoice total. The message has been improved so that if the invoice balance is zero, the message now displays as the following instead of display a blank instead of 0:  </P>
 <P style="margin-left:36.00pt;">“Warning: Invoice Balance is Zero and does not equal Invoice Total: 79.54. Do you want to continue?”</P>
 <H2>5.6  Create PM Invoice</H2>
 <P>This release corrects an error that occurred if RININV4 was used for PM Invoices. </P>
 <H2>5.7 Other Rate</H2>
 <P><FONT style="font-weight:bold; " >Changed Field: GL Credit Account:<BR></FONT>If you will be interfacing WO Other to GL, this field should be completed if this Other Rate will be entered on the WO Other Tab. Note that this functionality may be used in conjunction with the expense of Assets on the Work Order Other tab and Job Journal Co. Equipment viewer. </P>
 <P>This field also provides the default GL Credit on the Job Journal’s CoEquip Tab which enables chargeable Assets to be charged to a Job or Work Order. </P>
 <H2>5.8 AR Cash Receipts Journal</H2>
 <P>Updated buttons that are easier to read on high-resolution monitors have been added to this screen:  </P>
 <P style="margin-left:36.00pt;"><IMG src="images/autofillp.gif" border=0 height=28 width=94 alt="images\autofillp.gif"> <IMG src="images/enterinvoices_new.gif" border=0 height=28 width=94 alt="images\enterinvoices_new.gif"> </P>
 <P>Previously, changes were not allowed to entries referencing an inactive accounting period. In this release, changes (and applicable reversing entries) to receipts in inactive accounting periods will be written to the open accounting period and effective date that the user selects. Changes are not allowed if the receipt has been entered in the Bank Deposit Journal. </P>
 <H3>5.8.1 Validations </H3>
 <P>The following validations have been added to prevent the Client Id in AR Cash Receipts entries from being changed:</P>
 <P>1. The Client Id cannot be changed unless the AR Cash Receipts viewer is in Add Mode (this denies the user the ability to change the Client in existing entries.</P>
 <P>2. The Client Id cannot be changed when the AR Cash Receipts viewer is in Add Mode if any child rows have been entered in the middle section of the screen.</P>
 <P>3. Manually entered Invoice Ids (invcemstr) must be for the parent Client Id specified in the transaction.</P>
 <H3>5.8.2. Enter Invoices</H3>
 <P>The Remove Invoice button now correctly removes the selected line, not the following one. </P>
 <P style="margin-top:0;margin-bottom:0">&nbsp;</P>
 <H2>5.9 Service Invoice </H2>
 <P>This release corrects a problem when the Max Tax per Invoice protocol was implemented (SalesTaxMaxPerInvoice=true in sys-ffv-global-settings) where sales tax was assessed on Use Tax jobs.</P>
 <H3>5.9.1 COD Work Orders</H3>
 <P>Corrects a ‘Key is missing error’ in recent versions that occurred when invoicing zero dollar COD invoices.</P>
 <H3>5.9.2. COD Work Orders and Template Clients </H3>
 <P>New validation ensures that template-type clients are only billed when the net invoice amount is exactly ZERO DOLLARS.</P>
 <P>The Service Billing Worksheet report has been modified to display a very noticeable warning for each WO/Job invoice that would result in a template-type client being billed for any amount other than zero. The Service Worksheet report (SERVICEWORKSHEETv73b032.rpt dated 11/22/2011) must be imported to support this functionality.</P>
 <P>The following changes have been added to the process of preparing Service Invoices: </P>
 <P style="margin-left:36.00pt;">When the Service Invoice report is run, the system compiles a list of each WO/Job combination for which a Template Clients would be billed a non-zero amount. This list will be displayed in a workspace viewer that the user may choose to close or print.</P>
 <P style="margin-left:36.00pt;">In addition, the system auto-saves the compiled list as a text file. If the dbreportfiles registry entry exists, the system will use it to get the location to save the file with the Template Client errors. If the dbreportfiles registry entry does not exist, the Sampro base directory will be used to save the file with the Template Client errors.</P>
 <P style="margin-left:36.00pt;">Work Orders that make this list CANNOT be included in the invoicing run.</P>
 <P>This release allows zero dollar invoices with only costs (and no revenues/COD entries) to be billed to a template Client.  In addition, the Service Worksheet processing no longer brings up the list of each WO/Job combination; this is reserved for Service Invoicing only. </P>
 <H1>6. General Ledger</H1>
 <H2>6.1 Bank Reconciliation Journal</H2>
 <P>The GL Interest and Fees GL Accounts and Entities are now stored in the database for the Bank Reconciliation parent so they will always be available when a transaction is accessed for editing. </P>
 <H2>6.2 Recurring GL Journal</H2>
 <P>Recurring GL Journal entries are inactivated by setting the Last Effective Date to earlier than today. This enhancement adds a Last Effective Date range filter to the viewer list. This filter is preset to exclude entries with a Last Effective Date less than the current system date from the active list. </P>
 <P>The following fixes have been implemented to prevent out of balance entries: </P>
 <P style="margin-left:36.00pt;">If you Delete lines, the totals on top are now updated. </P>
 <P style="margin-left:36.00pt;">If you elect to Copy lines (from insert), the totals on top are correctly updated. </P>
 <P style="margin-left:36.00pt;">On an existing entry, change a debit or credit amount but do NOT tab out of the field will no longer allow you to save the entry OOB.</P>
 <H2>6.3 GL Journal </H2>
 <P>The upper portion of the GL Journal has been adjusted to show more information without scrolling. The Debits and Total Credits fields have been moved to the top of the child (lower) section of the scroll for easier visibility. </P>
 <P>A detail view of the child lines may now be accessed via the Magnify button. The detail view shows relevant Job and PO id values when available.&nbsp; </P>
 <H1>7. Job Costing</H1>
 <H2>7.1 Job Viewer</H2>
 <P>The system does not display Revenues, Invoices and Purchases if the Job is a Template or does not reference a Client Site. In this release, the messages that appear under these conditions have been made more specific (e.g., clicking the Revenues tab of a Template Job displays the message “Revenues data not available for Template Job”). </P>
 <P>If you click the sidebar button Create PO in a Job record and the system date (today) exceeds the Job’s Date Closed, the message ‘Cannot Create Job PO for closed Job’ will be displayed; the Purchase Order viewer will not be launched. &nbsp; </P>
 <P>The Job Tax Status radio buttons have been reordered so that ‘Unknown’ appears first, and will be the default when a blank Job record is displayed.  </P>
 <P>Previously, if the CloneJobEquipmentExistingSite registry was enabled, cloning the job resulted in the existing site having its PM Billing lines changed to the newest job. In this release, the Site’s PM Billing Schedule is not changed as a result of the clone. </P>
 <H3>7.1.1 Job viewer – Budget Tab</H3>
 <P>By default the effective date of Budget Entries posted to Job History via the Budget tab is set to blank (1900-01-01). See user note 2.1.1 for details on a registry option that causes the software to use the Job’s Date Open as the Effective date for budget entries made to job history from this tab. </P>
 <H3>7.1.2 Job Prevailing Wages Tab</H3>
 <P>When using the Prevailing Wage logic on a job, the job cost calculated for overtime was incorrect. This has been corrected in this release so that the job cost is no longer inflated.</P>
 <P><FONT style="font-weight:bold; " >Relabel</FONT><FONT style="font-weight:bold; " >e</FONT><FONT style="font-weight:bold; " >d Field  - Base Rate: (was Package)</FONT><BR>This field should be used to enter the base wage rate for this Prevailing Wage.

 <P style="margin-left:36.00pt;">Since the Employee’s regular Wages + Fringes total $28.00 / hours (greater than the prevailing wage Base + Fringe of $25.00/ hour), they will be used for payroll calculations for this Prevailing Wage job.</P>

 <P style="margin-left:36.00pt;">Since the Employee’s regular Wages + Fringes total $28.00 / hours, the Prevailing Wage methodology will come into effect since the Base Rate + Fringe Rate = 45.00 / hour. The system calculates the Employee’s Wages as follows:</P>

 <H2>7.2 Project Manager Workbench – New Viewer</H2>
 <P>If you click the sidebar button Create PO for a selected Job, and the system date (today) exceeds the Job’s Date Closed, the message ‘Cannot Create Job PO for closed Job’ will be displayed; the Purchase Order viewer will not be launched. &nbsp; </P>
 <H3>Purpose:</H3>
 <P>This new viewer is designed to enable a project manager to handle all critical functions related to a job including:</P>
 <P>RFI/RFP/Submittal/RFQ document creation and tracking, Subcontractor PO management, Vendor Invoice Approval and Change Order Management.</P>
 <H3>Usage: </H3>
 <P>Now handles Long Strings in Document Replacement for MS Office 2010.</P>
 <P>The Project Manager Viewer must be used to update the Project Manager record. </P>
 <P>Since the Project Manager Workbench can be used to change the Job record itself, the user cannot use both the Project Manager Workbench Viewer and the Job Viewer to update the same Job simultaneously. </P>
 <P>In order to use the RFI, Submittals, Transmittals, and RFQ functionality, a Word Document must be available for use as a template; see user release note 7.3 for details. Registry entries (see below) are required to specify the name and location of these documents.</P>
 <P style="margin-left:36.00pt;"><FONT style="font-weight:bold; " >Important Note on Customization Files:<BR></FONT>If your firm’s customization file impacts the Job record, these changes will also be in effect in the Project Manager Workbench.  Specific customization file changes to the Project Manager Workbench must be implemented by Data-Basics programming; see your support representative for details. </P>

 <P>By default the effective date of Budget Entries posted to Job History via the Budget tab is set to blank (1900-01-01).

 <H2>7.3.1 &nbsp;PM Workbench / External Apps</H2>
 <P>As we have done in the WO, Quote, PO and Shop Packet in previous SAM Pro versions, this enhancement allows Crystal Reports to pick up the specific ID (Job ID in this case) that is currently active in the program (PM Workbench in this case). With this new ability, Crystal Report Functions added to the Reports tab of the PM Workbench do not require the user to enter in the Job ID if the report is job based. The Crystal Report must use a parameter named exactly jb_id in order for it to have SAM Pro pass it to the report. </P>
 <P>In the specific example of how it is being used, the Client wanted to print out a “log record” of Submittals and RFI requests made for the job so that they could give that document to the Client/Architect. Without this enhancement, they would have to double-click on the Crystal Report Function in the Reports tab and remember the job id so they could manually fill it in. With this feature, the user immediately gets the report to run with no interaction for that specific job they are on.</P>
 <P style="margin-top:0;margin-bottom:0">&nbsp;</P>
 <H2>7.4 Job Progress Viewer</H2>
 <P>If you right-click on the Job Id (when a member of User Group All), the system no long asks if you wish to customize the field. Note that<FONT style="font-weight:bold; " > </FONT>low-level code now disallows viewers from re-viewing themselves, so it is no long possible to open the Job viewer from the Job Progress viewer.</P>
 <P>This release corrects a reported problem with calculation of the Margin %. This problem was caused by the budgeted revenue amount being truncated in the work area. </P>
 <H2>7.5 Job Billing Item</H2>
 <P>The system does not display Revenues, Invoices and Purchases if the Job is a Template or does not reference a Client Site. In this release, the messages that appear under these conditions have been made more specific (e.g., clicking the Revenues tab of a Template Job displays the message “Revenues data not available for Template Job”). </P>
 <P>Corrects overlapping fields problem with the Fee Taxable Box. </P>
 <H2>7.6. Job Template</H2>
 <P>The Job Tax Status radio buttons have been reordered so that ‘Unknown’ appears first, and will be the default when a blank Job record is displayed.  </P>
 <H2>7.7 Job Cost Category</H2>
 <P>PM (Project Manager) filtering has been applied to this viewer: if the PM Filter is completed in your user record, only those Billing Items that are eligible for your setting will appear. </P>
 <P><FONT style="font-weight:bold; " >Changed Field: GL Expense Account<BR></FONT>This field also provides the default GL Debit Account for Work Order Other lines if the Accounting Period option Work Order Other to GL is flagged. </P>
 <H2>7.8 Job Journal</H2>
 <P>This release corrects a sporadic error that resulted in the Job Journal posting incorrect reversals to GL history.</P>
 <P>Expenses posted to GL History now have the source journal correctly identified as Job Expense, not Job Labor. </P>
 <H3>7.8.1 Job Journal Expenses Tab</H3>
 <P>The Extended Revenue now automatically defaults if the Billing Item is not Fixed Fee. For Billing Items that are flagged as Fixed Fee, Allow Extras, it is still necessary to flag the Extra box in order for the Extended Revenue field to default. </P>
 <H2>7.9  Start Reverse Job Invoice</H2>
 <P>Invoices corresponding to the user’s PM (Project Manager) Filter may be selected. </P>
 <P>When reversing a service invoice, the user is now prompted with: &quot;You are reversing and invoice related to Work Order &lt;wrkordr_id). Would you like to set the Work Order Status to Invoice Ready?&quot; If the user clicks yes, the system now changes any work order technician lines currently set to Billed to Invoice Ready and recalculates the Escalation Status (setting it to Invoice Ready unless other Tech lines override this setting). If the user clicks no, the system reverses the invoice but doesn't change the WO Escalation status / tech lines.</P>
 <H3>7.9.1 Reversing PM Invoices</H3>
 <P>The default behavior of Start Compute Job Invoices is now to deny the reversal of PM Invoices. The PM Billing Schedule should now be used as the one-and-only source for PM Billing adjustments; the preferred method to reverse PM Invoices is by:  </P>
 <P>1- Adding a new line (with the appropriate negative values) to the Client Site PM Schedule</P>
 <P>2- Run Compute PM Billing</P>
 <P>3- Print the Negative Dollar invoice </P>
 <P>A registry entry (see user note 2.24) is available to allow (with a warning) the reversal of PM Invoices. </P>
 <H2>7.10  Project Manager Viewer:</H2>
 <P>If you click the sidebar button Create PO for a selected Job record, and the system date (today)  exceeds the Job’s Date Closed, the message ‘Cannot Create Job PO for closed Job’ will be displayed; the Purchase Order viewer will not be launched. &nbsp; </P>
 <H2>7.11 Start Job Cost Allocation </H2>
 <P>Corrects the Start Job Cost Allocation ‘Key is missing’ error that occurred when attempting to enter the Start Date. </P>
 <P style="margin-top:0;margin-bottom:0">&nbsp;</P>
 <H1>8. Inventory</H1>
 <H2>8.1 Inventory Adjustments Journal</H2>
 <P><FONT style="font-weight:bold; " >New Field: Bill Item<BR></FONT>You may now specify the Job Billing Item when doing Job-related transfers and adjustments. The Billing Item will default from the Cost Code (if specified in the Cost Code), but may be changed by the user.  </P>
 <P><FONT style="font-weight:bold; " >New Field:  </FONT><FONT style="font-weight:bold; " ><BR></FONT><FONT style="font-weight:bold; " >Transaction Type:</FONT></P>
 <P style="margin-left:36.00pt;"><FONT style="font-weight:bold; " >Loc-to-Loc<BR>Loc-to-Job<BR>Job-to-Job<BR>Job-to-Loc<BR>Adjustment</FONT></P>
 <P>This new field implements validation logic that ensures that the data entry for Transfers is consistent with the selected Transaction Type.&nbsp; For example, entry of job-related data is not permitted on a Loc-to-Loc (Location to Location) transfer transaction. Before entering your transfer data, select the appropriate Transaction Type. </P>
 <P>The Transaction Type of Adjustment permits data entry according to the previous rules due to the wide variety of adjustments that may be made. During data conversion, existing records will be displayed as Adjustments. </P>
 <H2>8.2 Inventory Physical Count</H2>
 <P>This release corrects a problem in the List Physical Count report: the List Missing Items option, as well as the First and Last Uncounted fields now work properly.</P>
 <H3>Implement Export/Import Mechanism Via Spreadsheets</H3>
 <P>This enhancement has been made to facilitate the ease of data collection for physical inventory counts by exporting a spreadsheet file with the suggested list of parts to count for the batch’s Location. This spreadsheet may then be updated using a spreadsheet program, and then imported into the Physical Count Viewer so that the adjustments may be computed. </P>
 <P>To implement this enhancement, two new buttons have been added to the Physical Count Viewer; ‘1b. Build Export Files’ and  ‘2b. Import Entries.’ If these two buttons are used, the ‘1a. Load OnHand’ and ‘2a. Print Report’ buttons should NOT be used.</P>
 <P><IMG src="images/build_export_files.gif" border=0 height=28 width=100 alt="images\build_export_files.gif">  Build Export Files Button<BR>When this button is clicked, the system opens a window requesting the Activity Window in Days to ensure that inactive, old stock that is not currently on hand at the location will be excluded from this process. Depending upon your firm’s needs and business cycle, an appropriate number of days could range from 3 months (90 days) to a couple of years (730 days).</P>
 <P>Once the user has entered the desired number of days and clicked the OK button, the system will generate a comma separated ASCII file that can be opened in Excel. A browser window will be opened to allow the user to select the name and save location of this file. The file will contain all inventory items that are currently on hand in a user specified location (truck) along with any inventory items that have an on hand quantity less than or equal to 0 that have any on hand activity (+/-) within the Activity Window in Days.<BR>The fields in the ASCII file will contain:</P>
 <P style="margin-left:36.00pt;">Inventory Item Id <BR>Inventory Item Name <BR>Count (this will be blank for all parts listed and will need to be filled out by the user): <BR>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; note that any count left blank will be treated as zero when the file is imported <BR>Comment 1 <BR>Comment 2 <BR>Sequence No.</P>
 <P><IMG src="images/importentries.gif" border=0 height=28 width=100 alt="images\importentries.gif"> Import Entries Button<BR>This release also adds functionality will allow you to import the ASCII file (once it’s filled out) so that the system can calculate the adjustments necessary. To do so, simple click the Import Entries button, point to the applicable file when the browser window appears, and click Open.&nbsp; The data (excluding the sequence number) you entered in the spreadsheet will be imported.</P>
 <P><IMG src="images/computeadjustments.gif" border=0 height=28 width=100 alt="images\computeadjustments.gif"> Next, click the Compute Adjustment button and then Save the batch. At this point, you may make any further adjustments needed, and click the Post Adjustments button to update the physical inventory for this location. </P>
 <H2>8.3 Report Stock Status Report</H2>
 <P>A &quot;Print Summary Only&quot; box has been added to this report. When checked, only the summary sections of the report (for Locations and Groups) will be printed. </P>
 <H2>8.4 Inventory Item</H2>
 <P>The Equipment Type Id has been added as a Range Field to the Inventory Item Filter Screen.</P>
 <P>Corrects the Inventory Serial Tab 'openLabTestResults' Not Understood error when double-clicking on a line. The Serial/Lot Master is now correctly displayed. </P>
 <P>The Locations, Purchases, YTD, and Orders tabs no longer display spurious information for the blank record. </P>
 <P>This release corrects a Last Unit Cost problem that occurred sporadically with new Inventory items.  </P>
 <H3>8.4.1 Inventory Item Vendors Tab</H3>
 <P>The Inventory Item Vendor Tab’s Price field is no longer updated by Credit PO’s. </P>
 <H3>8.4.2 Price Code Handling – change to default behavior </H3>
 <P>This change impacts the Work Order, Quote, Client Order, and CSRAnywhere (Quote Management).</P>
 <P>The Inventory Item allows for 10 levels of Material Pricing, but Price Codes only allow for 5. In this situation, if a client normally had material price level 7, and Price Codes were in effect, the system would use markup pricing instead.</P>
 <P>In this release, with price codes in effect, and the default price level from the Client Site or Job is greater than 5, the system now defaults price level 1 from the Price Code. A registry entry (see user note 2.4.9) is available to always default Price Code Level 1. </P>
 <H3>8.4.3 Purchases Tab</H3>
 <P>The Purchases Tab was not displaying On Hand values correctly if a receipt was made on the base purchase order, the purchase order was made a change order, and then the remainder was received. This problem has been corrected. </P>
 <H3>8.4.4 Pricing / Costing Tab</H3>
 <P>An Updated button that is easier to read on high-resolution monitors has been added to this tab: </P>
 <P style="margin-left:36.00pt;"><IMG src="images/showcomputation.gif" border=0 height=28 width=100 alt="images\showcomputation.gif"> </P>
 <P style="margin-top:0;margin-bottom:0">&nbsp;</P>
 <H2>8.5 Location viewer</H2>
 <P>Corrects the Inventory Serial Tab 'openLabTestResults' Not Understood error when double-clicking on a line. The Serial/Lot Master is now correctly displayed. </P>
 <H3>New Tab: Location Items</H3>
 <P>This record now displays correctly if one or more inventory items on the Location Items tab have a quantity-on-hand of 100,000 or more. </P>
 <P>This release corrects a discrepancy between the On Hand figures between the Location Viewer's Location Item tab and the Inventory Viewer's Location tab. The calculation used to display the Locations Items tab no longer includes the quantity bought to a Job in the On Hand column. </P>
 <P>The Location viewer has been enhanced to query both the Inventory Item and the Inventory History tables for info about the Location record being viewed.</P>
 <H3>New Button: Import Stock  Levels</H3>
 <P>The Import Levels button helps get a new truck 'started'.&nbsp; </P>
 <P>1. Create a new Location record.</P>
 <P>2. Push the Import Stock Levels button.</P>
 <P>3. Enter the Id of the Location from which to 'clone'.</P>
 <P>4. A check list is constructed from invntryitmlctn data based on the source Location.&nbsp; The user can select which Inventory Items to include.&nbsp; The Picking Sequence, Reorder Level and Order Up To values can be edited as necessary.&nbsp; When the GO button is pushed, all selected records will be added to the invntryitmlctn table for the new truck.</P>
 <P style="margin-left:36.00pt;"><FONT style="font-weight:bold; " >Note: Using Import Stock Levels to update Existing Sites (Trucks)<BR></FONT>This functionality can also be used for existing Trucks / Locations. If an item already exists at the location you are updating, any ‘on hand’ data will not be changed. However, the existing Picking Sequence, Reorder Level and Order Up To values will be reset from this function. </P>
 <H2>8.6 Inventory Receipts Journal</H2>
 <P>Corrects a problem where Use Tax was not correctly written to the Tax History table when items were received in this viewer.  </P>
 <P>If a Work Order is specified in the PO, the system now sets the client site equipment when creating IRJ general item entries.</P>
 <P>This release corrects a problem where the received cost was not reset if a user received an inventory item, unreceived it, and re-received it. </P>
 <P>The user is now required to specify an accounting period before changing any of the detail lines. </P>
 <H3>8.6.1 Un-receiving a PO</H3>
 <P>This release corrects a problem with un-receiving an item on a PO if it was received and then vouchered (but not yet paid) in an accounting period that had since been closed. Although the user could change the effective date and accounting period in the AP Journal, the delete the journal entry (thereby making the PO eligible to be un-received), they received an error message that the line was still vouchered in the Inventory Receipt Journal.  The code has been changed so that the PO can now be successfully un-received in this situation. </P>
 <H2>8.7 Inventory Restock processing</H2>
 <P>In previous releases, the system deleted closed (completed) Inventory Restock transactions. This resulted in a lack of an appropriate audit trial for this function. The default in this release is to not delete restock records when they are closed.</P>
 <P>To set the software to re-enable deletion for closed entries, set the following registry entry:</P>
 <P><FONT style="font-weight:bold; " >Id: sys-viewer-vrstck</FONT><BR><FONT style="font-weight:bold; " >Setting Key:</FONT>  DeleteClosedTransactions  <FONT style="font-weight:bold; " >Setting Value:</FONT> true<BR><BR>A Status filter range has been added to the Inventory Restock List and Inventory Restock Pick List Entry viewers. By default, this range is set to Open.  To view both Open and Closed entries, click the All filter button. To view only Closed entries, click the Closed filter button. &nbsp;</P>
 <H3>8.7.1 View Inventory Restock List</H3>
 <P><FONT style="font-weight:bold; " >New Fields: Status: Open Closed<BR>Closed By, Date Closed, and Time Closed</FONT></P>
 <P>These display-only fields are maintained by the system. A Restock entry will be closed by the system when the Close Pick Ticket button is clicked in the View Inventory Restock Pick List Entry viewer. The Closed By, Date Closed, and Time Closed fields will also be set at this time.</P>
 <P><FONT style="font-weight:bold; " >New Tab: IMH</FONT></P>
 <P><FONT style="font-weight:bold; " >Item Id:  Location  On Order:  To Pick:  Transferred: Received:</FONT></P>
 <P>This tab displays the Inventory History summary for this entry. </P>
 <P>When a Restock entry is first created, the On Order value of the Restock To Location, and the To Pick: value of the Order From Location will both default from the Quantity to Pick on the Items tab.  </P>
 <P>When the Pick List Entry has been completed, the Transferred and Received columns will be updated, and the On Order and To Pick columns revised.</P>
 <P>When the Close Pick Tick button is clicked in the Restock Pick Ticket Entry viewer (and the record saved), Inventory History will be adjusted so that any remaining On Order / To Pick quantities are zeroed out. </P>
 <H3>8.7.2 View Inventory Restock Pick List Entry</H3>
 <P><FONT style="font-weight:bold; " >New Fields: Status: Open Closed<BR>Closed By, Date Closed, and Time Closed</FONT></P>
 <P>These display-only fields are maintained by the system. A Restock entry will be closed by the system when the Close Pick Ticket button is clicked. The Closed By, Date Closed, and Time Closed fields will also be set at this time.</P>
 <P><FONT style="font-weight:bold; " >Changed Button: Close Pick Ticket</FONT></P>
 <P>In previous versions, the system deleted Inventory Restock and Inventory Restock Pick Ticket Entry records when the Pick Ticket was closed. In this release, these records are only deleted if the DeleteClosedTransactions is set to true in the sys-viewer-vrstck entry. </P>
 <H2>8.8 Start Inventory Item Cost Update</H2>
 <P>Corrects a problem where this function was not updating the Item’s Average Cost field (use for third-party reports) with the ‘calculated’ average cost that is displayed in the Item Viewer.</P>
 <H2>8.9 IM History </H2>
 <P>This release corrects a system primitive error that only occurred if sys-startscreen-filter was set for IM History and he/she attempted to create or select a named range.</P>
 <H2>8.10 Inventory Item Stock Status viewer</H2>
 <P>This function now excludes non-inventory items. This release also corrects a display issue with the On Hand and Available quantities – these fields now correctly display their values to the right of the decimal point on the selected line.</P>
 <P style="margin-top:0;margin-bottom:0">&nbsp;</P>
 <H1>9. Payroll</H1>
 <H2>9.1. PR Adjustment Journal</H2>
 <P>The ability to post the Earning Type from the Earnings tab is now implemented as a table change.  </P>
 <H2>9.2 Payroll Period</H2>
 <P>In previous releases, an attempt was made to allow the user to maintain multiple default payroll periods by security. On further consideration, this was decided that this is not a good idea. The validation has been changed so that only one payroll period can be saved as the as the default. </P>
 <H2>9.3 Report PR Export</H2>
 <P>Previously, this function attempted to consolidate multiple entries for the same date. In this release, these entries remain broken out as they should be. </P>
 <P>The function Report PR Export creates a text file that payroll companies will use to generate paychecks. A report for the user to review/file will also be printed. </P>
 <P>Paycor (see user note 9.3.1) and Paychex (9.3.2) versions are currently supported; the report version that is generated is controlled via registry. See user note 9.3.3 for details on updating the Pay Type, Other Rate and Tax Authority records to support this functionality. </P>
 <H3>9.3.1 Report PR Export (Paycor)</H3>
 <P>The function Report PR Export creates a text file that Paycor will use to generate paychecks. </P>
 <P><FONT style="font-weight:bold; " >Usage:</FONT></P>
 <P>This functionality requires that a vrgstry.cus file with the necessary permissions be in place. It may be necessary to run Start Update Functions to see this report. Note that this report is part of the image itself and does not have to be imported into the database.</P>
 <P>The report function Report PR Export must be run AFTER the Compute Payroll function is run for the desired Payroll Period. </P>
 <P>The report will be saved in the directory specified in the sys-pr-export registry as PAYCOR-<FONT style="font-style:italic; " >payrollperiodid</FONT>.txt (for example, if the payroll period id was 10June, the filename would be PAYCOR-10June.txt). </P>

 <H3>9.3.2 Report PR Export (Paychex)</H3>
 <P>The function Report PR Export creates a text file that Paychex will use to generate paychecks as well as a printed, formatted version that you may retain for your records. </P>
 <P><FONT style="font-weight:bold; " >Usage:</FONT></P>
 <P>This functionality requires that a vrgstry.cus file with the necessary permissions be in place. It may be necessary to run Start Update Functions to see this report. Note that this report is part of the image itself and does not have to be imported into the database.</P>
 <P>The report function Report PR Export must be run AFTER the Compute Payroll function is run for the desired Payroll Period. </P>
 <P>When you print the report, a formatted version of the report will be printed, AND the text version of the report will be saved in the directory specified in the sys-pr-export registry as <FONT style="font-style:italic; " >client#</FONT>-ta.txt (for example, if your client number (as specified in the sys-pr-export registry) is 12345, the filename would be 12345-ta.txt. This text file should be used as directed by Paychex when reporting on your company’s payroll.</P>
 <P><FONT style="font-weight:bold; " >Important Note on Paychex</FONT><FONT style="font-weight:bold; " > PRS Codes:</FONT><BR>In order for the data in the PR Export Report to be interpreted correctly, the appropriate codes (consult your Paychex documentation) must be present in your data – either in the PRS fields in the Tax Authority, Pay Type, and Other Rate records, or as the Id’s of these records  (the record Id will be used if the PRS field is blank).

 <H2>9.4 Start CPP Time Import</H2>
 <H3>Purpose:</H3>
 <P>This Starter provides an import function for adding time and job cost information collected by Complete Payroll Processing’s (CPP) Web based time sheet program to the Sam Pro Labor Journal.</P>
 <H3>Usage:</H3>
 <P>The Starter function allows a user to browse to a CPP populated .csv formatted file, open the file and have its contents imported into a data edit screen for review, possible correction and ultimate import into Sam Pro. Once imported, the time data will be editable via the standard Sam Pro Labor Journal just like time manually entered into the Labor Journal. There will be a unique Labor Journal transaction for each employee/payroll period combination specified in the import file. There is no planned functionality for “un-importing” or reversing the data after a successful import is completed.</P>
 <H3>IMPORT FILE SPECIFICATION</H3>
 <P>The file definition for the .csv (comma separated ASCII) file is as follows:</P>
 <P>Field 1: Hours- 999.99 (required)</P>
 <P>Field 2: Effective Date- yyyymmdd (required)</P>
 <P>Field 3: Work Order Id-up to 10 char. alpha numeric.</P>
 <P>Field 4: Job Id-up to 10 char. alpha numeric (required if work order id not specified)</P>
 <P>Field 5: Job Cost Code-up to 30 char. alpha numeric (required if work order id not specified)</P>
 <P>Field 6: Job Cost Category Id- up to 10 char. alpha numeric (required)</P>
 <P>Field 7: Pay Type Id- up to 10 char. alpha numeric (required)</P>
 <P>Field 8: Payroll Period Id- up to 10 char. alpha numeric (required)</P>
 <P>Field 9: Employee Id- up to 10 char. alpha numeric (required)</P>
 <P>Any field that currently defaults when entering time into the Labor Journal but not specified in the file layout will continue to default based on current default rules. For example, the Job Billing Item which isn’t being supplied in the import file will default from the Job Billing Item stored in the Job Cost Code specified in the file. The Labor Rate Id, also absent from the import file, will default from the stored Labor Rate Id in the specified employee record. </P>
 <H3>Registry:</H3>
 <H3>Specify File Location</H3>
 <P>Id: sys-start-scpptmeimprt&nbsp;Name: Start CPP Time Import</P>
 <P>Setting Key: CSVDirectory&nbsp;Setting Value: path</P>
 <P>If not set, the default is the SAMPro base directory (containing the v.exe).</P>
 <H3>Specify Labor Rate Override</H3>
 <P>This option allows the user to specify the Labor Rate Id to use when a specific Pay Type Id is specified in the import file. If no cross reference is specified in the registry, the Labor Rate Id (absent from the import file), will default from the stored Labor Rate Id in the specified employee record. </P>

 <P>&nbsp;Example: Setting Key: reg-admin&nbsp;Setting Value: admin</P>
 <H3>FUNCTIONALITY</H3>
 <P>When a user launches the new starter function a standard Windows browser launches so that the user can navigate to the location of the import file. When user selects the file and open, the system will generate an editable selection screen containing a two-row entry for each row found in the import file. The top row will display only the values found in the import file; the bottom row will display editable, validated matches found in the Sam Pro database.</P>

 <P>The bottom row list the Sam Pro defaults, and the WO Id, Job Id, Job Cost Code,  Job Cost Category and Pay Type Id may be edited. If Sam Pro does not have a matching database value for a specified field in the import file (i.e. invalid Work Order, Job, Cost Code, Cost Category, Employee, Effective Date, Payroll Period or Pay Type) the Sam Pro default line value will be left blank and importing of the line will be prevented until a user manually provides a valid value.</P>
 <P>If the system finds an exact duplicate entry already existing in the Sam Pro Labor Journal, the word “Duplicate” will be displayed on the row and the Do check box will be automatically un-checked. The user can override this condition by re-checking the Do box.</P>
 <P>After verifying the import information and making any necessary corrections the user will push the GO icon and the system will create and post all necessary Labor Journal entries in Sam Pro. There will be one Labor Journal Transaction Id for each employee/Payroll Period combination found in the import file. A message “Successfully imported” will be displayed.</P>
 <H2>9.5 Time Entry Wizard</H2>
 <H3>Purpose:</H3>
 <P>The Time Entry Wizard allows labor that is being charged to a work order to be entered in a user-friendly start time and end time basis and have the system work out the details of regular, overtime and double-time labor and pay rates. When time is posted from the Wizard to the Work Order, the system automatically calculates straight time, time and a half (o/t) and double time for both pay and bill hours based on a shift definition defined in the Technician record and regular time billing period defined in the Work Order’s Job record. </P>
 <H3>Usage:</H3>
 <P>A customization file is required to run this module. </P>

 <H3>Technical Details: </H3>
 <P>When above information is entered in the wizard, the system will calculate regular, overtime and double time pay and bill hours based the following rules and write to the Labor tab of the work order:</P>
 <P>Any hours worked before the Technician Start Time or after the Technician End Time defined in the Technician record will be considered overtime pay and default the calculated hours and Technician Overtime Pay Type Id found in the Technician record and other entered information to the Labor entry screen on the Work Order.</P>
 <P>Any hours worked before the Regular Billing Start Time or after the Regular Billing End Time found in the Job referenced in the Work Order will be considered overtime billing and default the calculated hours and the Technician Overtime Labor Rate Id found in the Technician record along with other entered information to the Labor entry screen on the Work Order.</P>
 <P>If any of the hours worked are on Saturday, they will be considered overtime pay and overtime bill unless the referenced Job has the &quot;Saturday Included&quot; box checked which will then calculate overtime pay but regular time bill if hours are within Reg. Billing Start/End times defined in Job record. If any of the hours worked are on Sunday, they will be considered overtime pay and overtime bill unless the referenced Job has the &quot;Sunday Included&quot; box checked which will then calculate overtime pay but regular time bill if hours are within Reg. Billing Start/End times defined in the Job record.</P>
 <P>If any of the hours worked are on a defined company holiday or a Sunday, they will be considered double time pay and double time bill hours.</P>
 <P>If Travel check box is marked, default the appropriate Travel Labor Rate Id from Technician Record.</P>
 <P>If Shift Override check box is marked, treat hours worked as regular time.</P>

 <H2>9.14  “Percent of Wages” Vacation Accruals</H2>
 <P>This enhancement implements vacations accruals with a 'percent of wages' option for Canadian Payroll scenarios and possibly for certain US setups. This enhancement also excludes vacation pay used in the current period from vacation accrual calculations for current period.</P>
 <P style="margin-left:36.00pt;"><FONT style="font-weight:bold; " >Important Note:  <BR></FONT>SAMPRO does NOT have support for multiple percentages per employee in a single pay period.  All percentage rate changes must coincide with the starting date of a Pay Period.   </P>
 <H3>9.14.1 Employee Record</H3>
 <P><FONT style="font-weight:bold; " >New Field: PTO Tab – Prcnt:<BR></FONT>The percent of wages field (Prcnt:) allows this Paid Time Off to be calculated as a Percent of Wages rather than a number of Hours.  Any one PTO line can have either Hours or Percent but not both.</P>
 <H3>9.14.2 Pay Type Record</H3>
 <P><FONT style="font-weight:bold; " >Category Field – New Options: Vacation Holiday Other</FONT></P>
 <P>These fields are used in the Compute Payroll process that calculates percent-of-wage PTO earnings accruals for Employees with a PTO line having the new Percent field filled in.&nbsp; Validation code has been added to enforce proper use of Hours Type and Category combinations as follows:</P>
 <P style="margin-left:36.00pt;">When Hours Type is 'Worked', Category must be 'Regular', 'Overtime', or 'Doubletime'.</P>
 <P style="margin-left:36.00pt;">When Hours Type is 'PTO', Category must be 'Holiday', 'Sick', 'Vacation' or 'Other'.</P>
 <P style="margin-left:36.00pt;">When Hours Type is 'Other', Category must be 'Other'.</P>
 <P><FONT style="font-weight:bold; " >New Field: PTO Accrual Method: Hours  Percent  CurrentPayRate</FONT></P>
 <P>This field allows for specification of the PTO Accrual Method.&nbsp; Three options are currently supported.</P>
 <P style="margin-left:36.00pt;">'Hours' is the default.</P>
 <P style="margin-left:36.00pt;">'Percent' is the new method implemented for Canadian Vacation pay.</P>
 <P style="margin-left:36.00pt;">'CurrentPayRate' is the alternate methodology implemented with the registry entry ShowPTOAvailableAs=dollar in sys-report-rprchck. </P>
 <P>The Pay Type viewer will default the methodology to 'Percent' for Canadian v.cus file users whenever the Pay Type's Category is set to Vacation for new or changed records. Note that Pay Types that existed before these enhancements should be manually updated. </P>
 <P>The Employee viewer now has code that validates the use of the PTO amounts (hours or percent) relative to the Pay Type's Accrual Method.</P>
 <H3>9.14.3 Compute Payroll</H3>
 <P>This enhancement has been implemented in the Compute Payroll process to calculate percent-of-wage PTO earnings accruals.&nbsp; This code is triggered by the Employee PTO line having the new Percent field filled in.&nbsp; The percentage is applied to the employee's Modified Gross Wages for the period.&nbsp; Modified Gross Wages are defined as the employee's gross wages less any wages classified as the same Pay Type Category (i.e. 'Vacation') as the PTO.</P>
 <P>In other words, don't accrue vacation earnings against vacation being paid out.&nbsp; The key to this is matching up the Pay Type Category selections.</P>
 <P>The resulting calculations are stored in the PRH Hours table's Earnings Accrued field.&nbsp; A new field has been added to PRH Hours to store the Percent captured from the Employee PTO line at the time of the compute.&nbsp;</P>
 <P><FONT style="font-weight:bold; " >New Field Range Screen (Canadian Customers Only): </FONT></P>
 <P><FONT style="font-weight:bold; " >Paid Time Off: Accrue?</FONT></P>
 <P>As with previous versions of SAMPRO, PTO accruals are calculated during the Compute PR process and are subject to the Accrue PTO flag from the Pay Period record.&nbsp; Some special situations can be controlled by creating special Pay Periods and not selecting the Accrue PTO option.&nbsp; A Christmas Bonus payroll would be one such example.</P>
 <P>In other situations it might be more beneficial to have Accrue PTO selected in the Pay Period but have the option to override it during the Compute PR process.&nbsp; The Compute PR input screen has been changed (Canadian customers only) to allow an override of the Pay Period's Accrue PTO option.&nbsp; </P>
 <H3>9.14.4 Payroll Adjustment Journal </H3>
 <P><FONT style="font-weight:bold; " >Hours Tab New Field: %Accr<BR></FONT>To facilitate the loading of beginning balances, the Payroll Journal has been modified to allow entry of the Accrued Percent.&nbsp; Values entered into this new field are posted to the corresponding field in the PRH Hours table.&nbsp;</P>
 <H3>9.14.5  Payroll Period</H3>
 <P><FONT style="font-weight:bold; " >Changed Field: Accrue PTO Hours?<BR></FONT>The field previously labeled 'Accrue PTO Hours?' has been changed to the more generic 'Accrue PTO?'.&nbsp; Note that the functionality has NOT changed.&nbsp;</P>
 <H2>9.15 Worker’s Comp State </H2>
 <P><FONT style="font-weight:bold; " >New Field: WC Gross from Prevailing Wages: Exclude Fringes<BR></FONT>Workers comp 'wages' typically should not include any amounts related to prevailing wage fringes (entered in the Fringe Rate field of the Job’s Prevailing Wages tab).&nbsp; This new behavior is activated by flagging the Exclude Fringes field in the appropriate Workers Comp State records. </P>
 <H2>9.16 Deductions Viewer – Support for Third Party Sick Pay </H2>
 <P>This enhancement supports coding for third-party sick pay. If the W-2 Category field is set to<FONT style="font-weight:bold; " > </FONT>12:J, anytime an amount is found for Box 12 Code J, the system will mark the Box 13 check box labeled Third-party Sick Pay on the W2. </P>
 <H2>9.17 Report PR W-2</H2>
 <P>This release supports the formatting changes in the W3 form printed for 2011 taxes. </P>
 <P>An earlier release increased the size of Box 12 Code Fields from 1 to 2 characters. These codes are specified in the W-2 Category fields of the Deduction and Earning viewers. This enhancement was specifically added to support the after tax contributions to Roth retirement plans which requires codes AA or BB. </P>
 <H3>9.17.1 W-2 Category Fields Added to Tax Authority and Tax Table</H3>
 <P><FONT style="font-weight:bold; " >Tax Authority – General Ledger Tab</FONT></P>
 <P style="margin-left:36.00pt;"><FONT style="font-weight:bold; " >New Field: W-2 Category Employee</FONT></P>
 <P style="margin-left:36.00pt;">This field supersedes the use of the User 1 field for the handling of box 12 and 14 codes, and for titles for unemployment insurance.  The User 1 field is still supported if this field is blank.&nbsp;</P>

 <H2>9.18 W2 Magnetic Media</H2>
 <P><FONT style="font-weight:bold; " >Box 12 Support: </FONT>This enhancement supports the inclusion the W2 Category fields in Deductions &amp; Earnings records in the Report W2 Electronic File functionality. Previously, only 401k deductions were supported. </P>
 <P><FONT style="font-weight:bold; " >Revised Report: RW2EF.rpt: </FONT>The revised Report W2 Electronic File, dated February 17, 2011, must be imported to support the new Box 12 functionality.  This report is suitable for version 7.2 and up. </P>
 <P>The revised Report W2 Electronic File (RWEF.rpt), dated 3/1/2011, also supports the new Box 12 functionality for Third Party Sick Pay. The Third Party Sick Pay flag in type RW records will be set if any PR History is found with a W2 Category of 12:J. </P>
 <P>In this version, a registry entry is now required to set Position 174 on the RE line as the default has been changed to blank to accommodate special processing for the state of Maryland. The following option is now required for federal processing with this report. </P>
 <H2>9.19 Compute PR (Canadian PR Issues)</H2>
 <P><FONT style="font-weight:bold; " > </FONT>This release corrects the application of CPP, EI and PPIP credits; eliminate excessive use of rounding, and implements use of standard tax credit.</P>
 <H2>9.19 Remote Time Entry</H2>
 <P>A new version of the Remote Time Entry executable (time_expense_viewer.exe), dated 2/11/2011, supports the printing of reports under newer OS such as Windows 7. Contact Support if this updated file is needed. </P>

 <H1>10. Quote Master</H1>
 <H2>10.1 Quote Viewer</H2>
 <P>The sys-viewer-vqte option ApprovalWizardDefaultTechStatus is used to set the default status in the Approval Wizard's Technician pane. In recent 7.3 releases, this option worked correctly UNLESS the technician was a subcontractor. In this release, the software has been corrected so that the ApprovalWizardDefaultTechStatus is also used for subcontractor technicians.</P>
 <P>Corrects an issue in recent releases where Notes attached to the Site were displayed when you clicked the Quote viewer’s Notes button: Notes attached to the Quote are now displayed. </P>
 <P>The registry option SetSourceWOStatusOnApproval was inadvertently omitted in early 7.3 releases. This functionality has been restored. </P>
 <P>If Outlook is enabled in the sys-email registry entry, the regular SAM Pro email form will appear when the Vendor Approval button is clicked. </P>
 <P>When you begin to add a Quote in Quote Master, the system will now ask if you wish to view the Notes associated with the Site you selected (either directly or by choosing a source Work Order). The registry options described in user notes 2.3.1 and 2.3.2  may be used to alter this behavior. </P>
 <H3>10.1.1 Main Tab</H3>
 <P>Updated buttons that are easier to read on high-resolution monitors have been added to this tab:</P>
 <P><FONT style="font-weight:bold; " >New Field: Job Id:</FONT><BR>This field defaults from the Work Order (if one was selected) or may be selected by the user to provide the default Job when the Quotemaster Wizard is run.  This Job’s Material Price Level will used for default pricing on the Quote’s Inventory tab, overriding the Client Site Material Price. If the Job Id is not completed, the system will continue to use the Site’s Material Price Level.</P>
 <P>If the Job Id is selected manually, the system now defaults in the Report Id, Quote Notes and Small Print from Job's Site, and the Branch Id will be set from the Job (if completed in the Job record) or from the Job’s Site (if the Branch is blank in the Job but completed in the Site).</P>
 <H3>10.1.2 Revenue Adjustments Tab</H3>
 <P>Improved handling of Yes/No answers to “Revenue Changes Detected: do you want to adjust the revenue” prompt. Now, if you answer Yes, the system will update the Revenue Adjustment tab for you. If you answer No, the Revenue Adjustment tab will not be revised by the system. </P>
 <P>When the Revenue Adjustment Id is changed on a Scope and it detects there are already revenue adjustment lines, the user is warned to remove the Revenue Adjustment Lines before trying to change the Revenue Adjustment Id. </P>
 <P>On fixed price scopes,  and using a Revenue Adjustment  with the Totals field set, the TaxType Id is now set to ‘ n/a’.  Previously, it was not set at all.  </P>
 <H3>10.1.3 Scope Tab </H3>
 <P>This fix corrects a problem in recent 7.3 release where blank lines in the Quote were not being deleted.  Note that additional validation has been added so that the user is not allowed to blank the Option Code; a message is displayed advising the user to use the Delete Line button instead. </P>
 <P>When entering a flat rate to a quote scope line, the scope of services in the quote scope line now always defaults from the corresponding field in the flat range category. </P>
 <P><FONT style="font-weight:bold; " >Equipment Id:<BR></FONT>The system no longer<FONT style="font-weight:bold; " > </FONT>defaults in the Equipment Id if multiple Equipment lines exist on the WO. The Equipment Id will only default if a single piece of Equipment appears on the source Work Order. </P>
 <P><FONT style="font-weight:bold; " >Copy From Button</FONT><FONT style="font-weight:bold; " >:<BR></FONT>A new button,<FONT style="font-weight:bold; " > </FONT>Copy From, has been added to the Quote Scope line.&nbsp; Pushing the button launches a new wizard that lets the user complete the selected scope line by copying the details from existing scope lines AND the Labor, Inventory, Material, Sub and Other lines associated with these Scope Options.</P>
 <P>Note that the user is responsible for managing revenue adjustments: these will NOT be generated if a line is copied.</P>
 <P>To use this feature:<BR>Your Quote must have one or more options that you wish to copy from. Next, add a new Scope line, complete its Option Code, change (or select) the Equipment Id if needed, and Save the Quote.</P>
 <P>Select the Scope Option line you just added, and then click the Copy From button. The Copy From Options Wizard will appear:</P>
 <P><FONT style="font-weight:bold; " >Copy From Options Wizard – Select Option Codes Screen:</FONT></P>
 <P style="margin-left:36.00pt;"><FONT style="font-weight:bold; " >Ok – Option Code – Quote Amount – Fixed Price –  Scope of Services</FONT></P>
 <P style="margin-left:36.00pt;">This screen allows you to select one or more existed options to update the selected scope option with – flag the OK box to select the Option Codes to Copy From. If more than one Option Code is selected, system will include details from all selected options and combine the Scope of Services text. </P>

 <P style="margin-left:36.00pt;"><FONT style="font-weight:bold; " >Scope of Services:</FONT> This field defaults from the Option(s) you selected in the previous screen. It may be adjusted if needed. </P>
 <P style="margin-left:36.00pt;">Click the Finish button to complete the copy or Cancel to cancel this operation.</P>
 <H3>10.1.4 Inventory Tab</H3>
 <P>The Inventory Item Id is now a required field.</P>
 <P>The Vendor Part number now correctly writes to the corresponding field in the PO that is created when the approval wizard is run. The Vendor Part Number on the PO also updates the Inventory Item’s Vendor tab.</P>
 <H3>10.1.5 Cloning a Quote / Additional Validation</H3>
 <P>This release adds enhanced validation so that the Quote's Client Site CANNOT be changed if any Scope or Equipment Tab lines have the Equipment Id completed. This includes the user changing the Site directly, or changing the source wo or job to one referencing a different site. </P>
 <P>The software supports the ability to ‘clone’ an existing quote’ When the user enters 'new' in the quote id of an existing quote and tabs out of the field, a new quote record is generated with the following changes implemented: </P>
 <P style="margin-left:36.00pt;">On the Scope tab, set all options to Open, clears the WO Id and Job Billing Id (if they exist), as well as the Opened, Accepted, Approved and Declined Fields.<BR>On the Inventory Tab, clear the PO Id and Vendor Quote No.<BR>On the Material Tab, clear the PO Id and Vendor Quote No.<BR>On the Subcontractor Tab, clear the PO Id and Vendor Quote No.<BR>On the Notes tab (header info) set the Status to Open, Status Category to Active, and Status date to today.</P>
 <P>The new quote may now be edited (subject to the enhanced validations) and saved. The system will assign the appropriate Quote Id when record is saved. </P>
 <H3>10.1.6 Notes Tab</H3>
 <P>Quote User fields 3-10 have been added to the Notes tab.  Previously, only two User fields were available. </P>
 <H2>10.2 Quote Master Approval Wizard</H2>
 <P>The work order registry option DenyChangesToQuoteMasterLines prevented Quote Master from writing to work orders in recent release. This problem has been corrected. </P>
 <P>In this release, the approval wizard sums the Subcontractor lines so that only one line for each Subcontractor will be written to the work order’s Tech tab, and the quote will post successfully. </P>
 <P>The system now warns the user if the Technician line being generated is for the same date/technician combination that already exists in the Work Order. If the user chooses to continue, the Technician line in the Work Order will be replaced by the Wizard’s Tech line.</P>
 <P>If the Client is on Credit Hold when a new work order is generated,<FONT style="font-weight:bold; " > </FONT>the Tech Tab<FONT style="font-weight:bold; " > </FONT>child lines are set as they should be for the type of technician they are assigned to, and the Work Order’s Escalation Status is set to Credit Hold and Credit Hold box is flagged. A Credit Manager must clear the Credit Hold box on the Work Order before it will appear on the Dispatch Board, or be released to a technician.</P>
 <P>Previously, if an Accounting Period was not flagged as Default, the posting of PO's from the Quotemaster Wizard failed. The following enhancement (when generated PO’s):  </P>
 <P style="margin-left:36.00pt;">1. Uses the default Accounting Period (if it exists),<BR>2. If no default exists, it uses the 'first' active accounting period with today's date in the date range.&nbsp;<BR>3. If both of the above fail, the Wizard warns the user, and the PO post fails as in previous releases. </P>
 <P>This release corrects a problem that occurred if the user immediately logged out of SAM Pro after the Approval Wizard was run: a new Work Order was created, and nothing else (no PO, no update to the Quote).&nbsp;  Also in this release, new Work Orders generated by Quote Master will have their Description field set to 'Quote: #####'.</P>
 <P>If a quote was set up to generate multiple PO's; only the last one (on the QM Wizard PO screen) was actually created if the user made no changes when the wizard was running. This has been corrected.</P>
 <P>In this release, 'waitcustapprvl' from has been removed from the default 'AutoUpdateWOTechStatusIgnore' list so that their status can be appropriately updated. </P>
 <H3>10.2.1 New Option: Create Job Budget</H3>
 <P>A<FONT style="font-weight:bold; " > </FONT>new option, Create Job Budget, has been added to the Quote Master Wizard. When selected, it will update the Job’s Budget tab. When new option is selected, the Quote Master data entry forms follow in this order: </P>
 <P style="margin-left:36.00pt;">Default Job Structure: <BR>Previously, the Default Job Structure screen information defaulted from the Job Id from the Work Order record.&nbsp;It now uses the new Job Id from the Quote record if it has been entered.&nbsp; </P>
 <P style="margin-left:36.00pt;">Job Budget Defaults<BR>Data from the Job Budget Defaults form is written to the Job Budget tab (and Job History) as budgeted cost.</P>
 <P style="margin-left:36.00pt;">Billing Defaults (when Scope has Fixed Price)</P>
 <H3>10.3 Quote Master Flat Rate Wizard</H3>
 <P>Selecting a Flat Rate has been wizardized. Additional forms have been added to the old Flat Rate import screen for Labor, Material and Inventory (based on the Flat Rate Category child tables) to allow the user to edit hours and quantities before the lines are imported into the Quote. These additional screens are accessed by clicking the Next button on the Flat Rate Wizard. </P>
 <P>If the user simply wishes to import the flat rate without adjusting the hours or quantities, the Finish button may be clicked. Note that the Flat Rate’s Pretax Price (if specified) will be used to set the Fixed Price on the Quote Scope. </P>
 <H1>11. Service Management</H1>
 <H2>11.1 Work Order Viewer</H2>
 <P>The Work Order Closing Call Script and Service Recommendation functions have been reinstated, correcting a problem in earlier versions of 7.3. </P>
 <P>WO Inventory (and other journals): This release implements enhanced journal validation logic to prevent sporadic posting reversals with inappropriate Transaction Ids. If this situation is about to occur, the erroneous reversal is suppressed AND an error is written to the error log noting the reversal suppression. This release also corrects a sporadic Inventory History reversal handling issue when the WO Inventory tab includes a combination of quoted and unquoted lines.</P>
 <P>Due to the work in the above enhancement, a registry entry is now required to display the WO Inventory / IM History Tab Mismatch Alert: see user note 2.4.7 for details. </P>
 <P>If you click the sidebar button Create PO, and the system date (today) exceeds the Work Order header’s Job Date Closed, the message ‘Cannot Create Job PO for closed Job’ will be displayed; the Purchase Order viewer will not be launched. &nbsp; </P>
 <P>If you click the sidebar button Material Requisitioning, and the system date (today) exceeds the Work Order header Job Date Closed, the message ‘Cannot Run Material Requisitioning for closed Job’ will be displayed; and the Requisitioning wizard will not be launched. &nbsp; </P>
 <P>When processing Required Resource Inventory, the Import Cost Wizard now skips truck stock that has already been entered on the Work Order Inventory tab.</P>
 <P>In previous releases, the blank Work Order record’s Purchases, Quote and TechAnywhere tabs were filtered to NO Work Order Id instead of showing nothing (or 0's). This has been corrected. </P>
 <P>If the sys-viewer-vwrkordr registry option DefaultJobByEquipmentId is set to true, the system now only changes the job when the Equipment Id is changed. </P>
 <P>Single Quotes (‘) entered in the Work Performed field of the Equipment tab are no longer doubled when they are written to the Invoice Description of Work Performed when the Build Description button is clicked.</P>
 <H3>11.1.0 Main Tab</H3>
 <P>The WO Printer and Event buttons have been moved to the side button bar. The Ok To Invoice and Preview buttons have been moved to the Invoicing Tab.</P>
 <H3>11.1.1 New Child Tab – COD</H3>
 <P>Note: also see user note 11.1.10 for COD Enhancements. </P>
 <H3>Purpose:</H3>
 <P>This tab allows multiple payments (such as part check, part cash) to be recorded on a work order.  Entries on this tab should ONLY be made for COD work orders, NEVER for billable work orders. If TechAnywhere is implemented, this tab will be populated when the TechAnywhere Post is run for COD Work Orders. </P>
 <P>The following should be set up correctly in order for entries on this tab to be processed correctly:</P>
 <P>- The Work Order’s Job should reference an AR Terms record that is correctly configured for COD’s.</P>
 <P>- The COD box in the Job’s AR Terms record must be checked. The AR Terms Id defaults from the Job when the Work Order is loaded, so the Job’s AR Terms record must be set correctly from the beginning.</P>
 <H3>Usage: </H3>
 <P>When generating a Service Invoice:</P>
 <P style="margin-left:36.00pt;">If one or more COD child tab lines are present where the Payment, Amount and Reference No. are completed, but the Invoice Id and CRJ fields have NOT yet been filled in by the system, the system will use the information on the COD child tab. </P>
 <P style="margin-left:36.00pt;">If no lines (or only lines with the Invoice Id and CR Trx Id fields completed) are present in the COD child tab, the information on the parent COD tab is used. </P>
 <P><FONT style="font-weight:bold; " >Note : TechAnywhere COD’s:<BR></FONT>For COD Invoices generated from TechAnywhere, the appropriate AR Sales AND Cash Receipts entries will be generated when the TechAnywhere Post is run. In addition, a copy of the Invoice the Tech printed for the customer will be downloaded from TechAnywhere and attached to the Work Order (but not the Client). </P>
 <P><FONT style="font-weight:bold; " >Note: If this Tab is not Visible<BR></FONT>When this setting is present, the new WO-COD child tab is not visible and therefore not available.</P>
 <P>Id: sys-start-ssrvcebllngcmpte   Setting Key: UseSJForCOD&nbsp;Setting Value: true</P>
 <H3>Important Fields: </H3>
 <P><FONT style="font-weight:bold; " >Payment Type Id:<BR></FONT>Enables the user to record the exact type of COD payment (e.g.,, cash, check, credit card, etc.). A payment type of “none” is useful for estimates and no charges.</P>
 <P><FONT style="font-weight:bold; " >Amount:<BR></FONT>The amount of the payment received. </P>
 <P>Reference No.:<BR>Typically, the check number or credit approval number. </P>
 <P><FONT style="font-weight:bold; " >Invoice Id:<BR></FONT>This display-only field will be completed by the system when the invoice is generated. </P>
 <P><FONT style="font-weight:bold; " >GL Account Id:<BR></FONT>This display-only field defaults from the Payment Type Id. </P>
 <P><FONT style="font-weight:bold; " >CRJ Trx Id:<BR></FONT>This display-only field will be completed by the system when the invoice is printed and the Cash Receipt entry is generated (manual entries) or posted from TechAnywhere. </P>
 <H3>11.1.2 Required Resource Tab</H3>
 <P><FONT style="font-weight:bold; " >Registry Entries:</FONT></P>
 <P><FONT style="font-weight:bold; " >T</FONT><FONT style="font-weight:bold; " >o Default Vendor:</FONT></P>
 <P>The Vendor (in the inventory item record) does not default when you enter a Required Resource line manually or as a result of generating a PM Work Order with flagged parts - the idea being that aggregation will be used. Customers that wish to generate individual po's for the work orders required resources  must individually set the Vendor Id in each line. The registry entry detailed in user note 2.8.3 changes this behavior so that the system will default in the Vendor Id from the Inventory record (if set) on manual Work Order Required Resource entries and on Create PM Workorders.</P>
 <P><FONT style="font-weight:bold; " >Do Not Write Required Resources to PM Work Orders </FONT></P>
 <P>If your firm uses required resources, the following registry option discussed in user note 2.11.2 may be used to prevent the writing of PM parts to the Required Resources tab for non-subcontractor technician (Required Resource lines are <FONT style="font-weight:bold; text-decoration:underline;" >never</FONT> written if the PM is created for a subcontractor technician. </P>
 <P><FONT style="font-weight:bold; " >New Functionality: Import Required Resources from Job Cost Budget Entries</FONT></P>
 <P>When you click the Import Required Resource button, the system will now ask 'Do you want to Import Required Resources from JC History?'</P>
 <P>If you answer ‘no’, the original import from a text file will run.</P>
 <P>if you answer ‘yes’, this new functionality invoke. A form prompt will ask for a required date and how to set the hold flag. Then all JC History budget material lines that match the Job/Cost Code/Billing Item id's specified in the work order header that HAVE NOT already been requisitioned will appear in a check list. Select the ones you want and press the GO button.  All selected lines will be added to the Required Resource table and the Workorder will be redisplayed.</P>
 <P><FONT style="font-weight:bold; " >Assorted Updates</FONT></P>
 <P>Corrects ‘Key is missing error’ importing required resources from JC history.</P>
 <P>Defaulting of the Equipment Id on the WO's Required Resource tab now works the same as it does for Labor, Inventory, etc. If one piece of Equipment is listed on the Equipment tab, its Equipment Id will default when a Required Resource line is entered. If more than one piece of Equipment is listed on the Work Order, the Equipment Id does NOT default so that the user can select the correct item. This defaulting methodology is true for lines manually entered by the user as well as those imported from Job History or an external file via the Import ReqRes button. </P>
 <P>Note: the Equipment on the Required Resource pick lists is limited to the Equipment on the Work Order Equipment tab. The user is not permitted to select Equipment not on the Equipment tab. </P>
 <H3>11.1.3 Labor Tab</H3>
 <P>This release corrects the posting of WO-Labor to Job History when the Work Order is set to Invoice Ready so that employees are not paid for Quoted lines. </P>
 <P>If user enters the Hours first, and then sets the Start End times (resulting in the Hours changing), the Revenue Amount is now updated correctly.</P>
 <P>The Start/End times from the Labor Journal (if included in the customization) are now used to update the Work Order Labor tab when labor is imported to the Work Order via Import Costs. </P>
 <P>The system now warns the user when entering time for a terminated employee; the Date Terminated (from the Employee record) will be included in the warning. </P>
 <P>Due to popular demand, the tab order has been changed so that the Description comes after the Effective Date – in previous versions of 7.2 and 7.3, it was after the flat rate field. If your upgrade to this version did not require a database conversion, you will require a new v.cus file to see this change (contact your support rep). </P>
 <P>This release corrects the revenue calculation of the first Labor line if the registry option (in sys-viewer-vwrkordr) DefaultLineDateFromDateWorkCompleted=true is implemented; previously, the Date validation was skipped when the Date defaulted in. </P>
 <H3>11.1.4 Technician Tab</H3>
 <P><FONT style="font-weight:bold; " >New Button: TechFinder</FONT><FONT style="font-weight:bold; " >:</FONT> <BR>A TechFinder button has been added to the Technicians tab. When clicked, the TechFinder opens, with the work order's Client Site Zone and the Certification for the first piece of equipment on the Equipment tab passed to the TechFinder filters. When the user completes the TechFinder processing, the system returns the selected Technician Id, Date and Time to the appropriate Technician line.</P>
 <P><FONT style="font-weight:bold; " >Tech Unavailability</FONT><FONT style="font-weight:bold; " >: </FONT>The following enhancement is enabled if the registry option IdentifyUnavailableTechs in sys-viewer-vdsptchbrd is set to true and time off has been entered on the Technician record’s Unavailable tab. When the Tech Id or Date Scheduled is added or changed, the user will be warned if the Technician is Unavailable. </P>
 <P><FONT style="font-weight:bold; " >Changed Button: Release to Tech<BR></FONT>A new registry option allows the user to define the statuses impacted by the Release to Tech button. See user note 2.8.12. </P>
 <P><FONT style="font-weight:bold; " >Changed Field: Log Type Id<BR></FONT>A new log order log type of 'No Bill' has been implemented.&nbsp; The expected usage is for PM work orders that have been pre-billed on PM Invoices. The precedence falls between Billed and Cancelled. If the Work Order Log type of No Bill has precedence, its Work Order Escalation Status will be set to ‘No Bill’ and the Escalation Category will be set to Billed.</P>
 <H3>11.1.5. COD (Parent Tab) </H3>
 <P>The following validation has been added to the WO’s parent COD tab:</P>
 <P style="margin-left:36.00pt;">1. Warn the user when any field is changed on the COD parent tab and the Work Order's terms are not COD.</P>
 <P style="margin-left:36.00pt;">2. Default the COD GL Account Id from the new field in the Payment Type record when the Payment Id is changed.</P>
 <P style="margin-left:36.00pt;">3. When selected Payment Type record includes a default GL Account, do not permit changes to the COD GL Account Id.</P>
 <P style="margin-left:36.00pt;">4. Treat COD Reference No and Payment Type Id as required fields when COD GL Bank Account Id is not empty.</P>
 <P style="margin-left:36.00pt;">Note: also see user note 11.1.10 for COD Enhancements</P>
 <H3>11.1.6 Revenue Adjustments</H3>
 <P>This version corrects processing when the Import Cost Wizard was invoked with NO lines being imported; Revenue Adjustments are now successfully computed. </P>
 <P>When the work order's Work Type is 'PM Invoice', changes are not allowed on the Revenue Adjustments tab.&nbsp; This includes line inserts and deletes. The previous behavior (to allow changes) can be restored with the following registry setting: <BR></P>
 <P style="margin-left:36.00pt;">Id: sys-viewer-vwrkordr<BR>Setting Key: PreventRevenueAdjustmentAccessOnPMInvoices  Setting Value: false </P>
 <P style="margin-left:36.00pt;">(default true)<BR></P>
 <H3>11.1.7 WO Import Costs Wizard</H3>
 <P><FONT style="font-weight:bold; " > Inventory Screen</FONT></P>
 <P><FONT style="font-weight:bold; " >Changed Field: Qty Used <BR></FONT>This field is now display-only; it defaults from the quantity allocated to this Work Order from the Purchase Order or Required Resource transfer.  </P>
 <P><FONT style="font-weight:bold; " >New Field: Actual Used</FONT><BR>This field defaults from the Qty Used field, and should be used to specify the number of this item that were actually used on this work order. If the user sets the Actual Used to less than the Qty Used, the system will handle the process of returning the unused product to the truck or other location. For example, if 50 items were allocated (Qty Used = 50) on the purchase order, and only 8 were actually used on this work order, two lines would be written to the Work Order Inventory Tab: +8 (those actually used) and -42 (returned to stock – to correct Inventory History which shows all 50 going to the Work Orders). </P>
 <H3>11.1.8 Work Order Other Tab</H3>
 <P>This update concerns users recently upgraded from v7.1 or earlier. When the date on Other tab entries originally entered in an earlier version was changed,  and then the work order was invoiced, the date for this invoice detail did not match the new date on the Other tab. This has been corrected. </P>
 <P>Insert Line with Copy is once again enabled for all lines except the following: <FONT style="font-weight:bold; " > </FONT>Insert-with-copy IS disabled when the line being copied references a closed Accounting Period that has the new WO-Other-to-GL option turned on.  </P>
 <P>This release corrects “Runtime error: Key is missing” problem when changing the Cost Code.  </P>
 <P>The following new fields have been added to this tab to enable the expensing of company assets, as well as to enable Work Order Other to GL functionality. See user note 19.6 for additional information on the changes to the Accounting Period, Other Rate, and Cost Category records required to support this functionality. </P>
 <P><FONT style="font-weight:bold; " >New Fields (click the Magnify button to view):</FONT></P>
 <P><FONT style="font-weight:bold; " >Asset Id:<BR></FONT>Enter the appropriate company equipment Asset Id if you wish to charge it to this  Work Order.

 <H3>11.1.9 Work Order Purchases Tab</H3>
 <P>If multiple inventory receipt journal entries are made for the same PO, the WO Purchases tab now displays the Job Quantity and Quantity Vouchered correctly. </P>
 <H3>11.1.10 Work Order Invoicing Tab</H3>
 <P>Work Orders that reference a Template-type Client will be only eligible for billing if the invoice total is ZERO; see user note 5.9.2 for available details on this validation.</P>
 <P>This release includes updated buttons for Ok to Invoice, Build Description, Print Worksheet, Print Invoice, Compute Taxes and Reset Tax Type. The Preview (Camera) button has been added to this screen (but its use is deprecated.) </P>

 <H3>COD Enhancements</H3>
 <P>This enhancement addresses two issues with COD invoicing:</P>
 <P style="margin-left:36.00pt;">1 - what to do when a work order for a COD Job (referencing a generic COD client) has receivables or overages, and must therefore be linked to an actual Client record. </P>
 <P style="margin-left:36.00pt;">2 - what to do when a work order for a COD Job (referencing an actual client) has receivables or overages, and must therefore recorded with ‘due’ (not COD) terms. </P>
 <P>The solution to both these issues is the addition of two new fields to the Work Order Invoicing tab, Override Terms Id (overrides the AR Terms Code in the WO Header Job) and Override Client Id (overrides the Client in the WO Header Job). When these fields are completed in a Service Compute Work Order, the override field will be used instead of those in the Job Header when the Invoice is computed and posted for the Job reference in the WO Header. </P>
 <P>An updated Service Invoice Report is required for this functionality: see the revised report section below. </P>
 <P><FONT style="font-weight:bold; " >Registry Entries:</FONT></P>
 <P style="margin-left:36.00pt;"><FONT style="font-weight:bold; " >Id: sys-viewer-vwrkordr</FONT> </P>
 <P style="margin-left:36.00pt;">The following registry entries are required to enable use of the Work Order’s Override fields, WO Terms Id and WO Client Id:</P>
 <P style="margin-left:72.00pt;"><FONT style="font-weight:bold; " >Setting Key:</FONT> AllowClientOverride  &nbsp;<FONT style="font-weight:bold; " >Setting Value:</FONT> true   (default is false)</P>
 <P style="margin-left:72.00pt;">This registry option is required to enable use of the Work Order’s Override Client field. If your firm normally uses a generic COD Client for COD work orders, set this value to true to enable the user to select / create on the fly an actual Client record to apply the overage / receivables to. </P>
 <P style="margin-left:72.00pt;"><FONT style="font-weight:bold; " >Setting Key:</FONT> AllowTermsOverride  &nbsp;<FONT style="font-weight:bold; " >Setting Value:</FONT> true  (default is false)</P>
 <P style="margin-left:72.00pt;">This option must be set to true to allow the Override Terms Id in the Work Order to be set by the user. </P>
 <P style="margin-left:72.00pt;">&nbsp;</P>
 <P style="margin-left:72.00pt;">If the technician calculates sales tax for COD work in the field, then set:</P>
 <P style="margin-left:72.00pt;"><FONT style="font-weight:bold; " >Setting Key:</FONT> ServiceComputeSaleTaxEdits    <FONT style="font-weight:bold; " >Setting Value:</FONT> true</P>

 <P style="margin-left:72.00pt;">This entry overrides the default error checking in the Sales Journal (which currently prevents you from mismatching the Job and the Client on a single entry.)  <FONT style="font-size:9pt; " >This registry setting NOT required if AllowClientOverride=false</FONT> AND your firm <FONT style="font-size:9pt; " >uses a separate JOB for each COD (it doesn’t use template COD jobs).  </FONT></P>

 <P><FONT style="font-weight:bold; " >Work Order Invoicing Tab:</FONT></P>
 <P><FONT style="font-weight:bold; " >Changed Field: AR Terms Id relabeled as Job Terms Id:</FONT></P>

 <P><FONT style="font-weight:bold; " >Override</FONT><FONT style="font-weight:bold; " > Client Id:<BR></FONT>If enabled by registry, this field may be used to override the Client in the WO header Job.(displayed as Job Client Id). Typically, this would be used if a Work Order for a COD Job (referencing a generic COD client) has receivables or overages, and must therefore be linked to an actual Client record for tracking AR. When the Work Order is invoiced, the AR Sales and Cash Receipts (if applicable) entries generated will reference the Override Client.</P>
 <P style="margin-left:36.00pt;"><FONT style="font-weight:bold; " >Examples:</FONT></P>
 <P style="margin-left:36.00pt;">The Override Client Id field would be set: </P>
 <P style="margin-left:36.00pt;">a)  to take a COD Workorder and create/specify a BILLABLE client for when a COD payment was not received due to homeowner not home or tech lost the check.  </P>
 <P style="margin-left:36.00pt;">b) if an over/under payment is received so that the balance due is put is assigned to actual client. </P>
 <P style="margin-left:36.00pt;">Important Note: no JOB is created - so that next time service work done for COD  client, COD payment is still expected. If you have to turn a COD client into a 'real' billable account then you MUST set-up a Service Job and change the site's default equip from defaulting to the COD job template to your new billable service job.</P>
 <P style="margin-left:36.00pt;">The Override Terms field would be set:</P>
 <P style="margin-left:36.00pt;">In case of issue a (above), change the terms from cod to DUE.</P>
 <P><FONT style="font-weight:bold; " >Revised Reports:</FONT> serviceinvoice.rpt and serviceworksheet</P>
 <P>If the Billing Address Id is completed, the billing address for the Service Invoice and Worksheet come from this field. If the Override Client Id is completed, but the Billing Address Id is not, the billing address for the Service Invoice and Worksheet come from the Override Client record.  </P>
 <P>Updated reports are required to support this functionality: </P>
 <P>SERVICEWORKSHEETv73b032.rpt  </P>
 <P>SERVICEINVOICEv73b032.rpt</P>
 <P><FONT style="font-weight:bold; " >A Note on Report Naming:</FONT></P>
 <P>The version and build number of the first Version/Build a report is valid for will now be appended to the filename of the user reports generated and update by our Data-Basics report writers. Note that is NOT necessary to change the filename before imported the report into a database: SAM Pro will use the internal Report Id and Name when updating / adding the report. </P>
 <H3>11.1.11 Required Resources Wizard</H3>
 <P>When this Wizard is invoked, the system now defaults the Location from the Work Order header.&nbsp; This Location can be overridden by the user, but can never be blank.</P>

 <P>If you double click on one of the lines on the Escalation parent tab, the applicable Scheduled Event record is now opened. </P>
 <H3>11.1.14 Scheduled Events Button</H3>
 <P>This release corrects a performance issue launching the Scheduled Event viewer from Work Order viewer’s Scheduled Event button. </P>
 <H3>11.1.15 Metrics Tab</H3>
 <P>The Metrics tab is now correctly updated when equipment is added, inserted or deleted from the Equipment tab, as well as when the Equipment Id is changed. </P>
 <P style="margin-left:36.00pt;"><FONT style="font-weight:bold; " >Note:</FONT> If an Equipment Id associated with Metrics is deleted, only those lines on the Metrics tab that have been recorded (a date and/or value has been entered) will be retained. If the same Equipment Id is re-entered, the system does not restore blank Metrics lines that were not recorded. </P>
 <H2>11.2 New Call</H2>
 <P>Previously, if you decided that your site/equipment selections were not correct and entered a different search string, fields that were previously completed were not automatically cleared. In this release, whenever a user tabs out of the search text box in New Call 1, all fields except the Service Category be cleared in preparation for selecting a new Site and Equipment..</P>
 <P>Corrects a “Key is missing” error in 7.3.498.093 that occurred when the user attempted to add a work order that had been created from a web log. </P>
 <P><FONT style="font-weight:bold; " >Tech Unavailability</FONT></P>
 <P>This enhancement is enabled if the registry option IdentifyUnavailableTechs in sys-viewer-vdsptchbrd is set to true and time off has been entered on the Technician record’s Unavailable tab. If the Technician and Date scheduled are both entered, a Warning will appear saying the Tech is Unavailable when the New Call is saved.<BR><BR>When you use New Call to create a Work Order from a Web Log, the Web Log's change entry is now updated with the Date, Time, and User Id and the description&nbsp;WOFromNewCall .</P>
 <P>The Client Site’s WO Other tab may be used to generate standard trip/truck charges to Work Orders created in New Call (this feature is not recommended for TechAnywhere users as this information is not uploaded to the TechAnywhere device). Previously, the Sales Tax Group and Type for the Work Order Other lines generated in this fashion were derived from the Sales Tax Group on the Client Site COP tab. In this release, the system uses the Sale Tax Group in the Job record when generating the Work Order Other tab line. </P>
 <P>Corrects a display issue that occurred if a Site with a Service Manager was picked a second time; this Service Manager Id was selected correctly, but not redisplayed in the field. </P>
 <H3>11.2.1 New Call -  New COD Site</H3>
 <P>Previously, the Zip Code’s Branch ID &amp; Service Zone were displayed when the New Call New COD Site view was first accessed, but as soon as you select one of your&nbsp;COD templates, the Service Zone was overridden from the COD Site Template, even if blank. This behavior has been changed this so that information from the Zip code is not overridden by blank Branch and Service Zone fields from the COD Site Template. </P>
 <P>Corrects an error encountered if the Service Manager was set in the CS Equipment record associated with the Site template. </P>
 <P>Corrects a problem where the Equipment the first WO created for a new COD site referenced the COD template, not the new site. Contact your service representative if existing data needs to be corrected. </P>
 <P>When a new COD Site is created, the Account Manager, Sales Rep, Service Manager and Dispatcher are now set from the Site Template. </P>
 <P>When a COD work order is created using this function, the Account Manager, Service Manager, Dispatcher and Sales Rep now default from the Site if the corresponding fields in the selected Equipment are blank.</P>
 <H3>11.2.2 New Call Work Order List</H3>
 <P>The Customer PO has been added as a column to the work order list in New Call. The Work Order list in the lower right-hand corner of the New Call screen now displays the columns in the following order for the standard WinII and CA customizations. </P>

 <H3>11.2.3  New Call New Client (Flashlight) Screen </H3>
 <P>Two new fields, Log Form Id:  and Escalation Profile Id: have been added to the Equipment section of this screen so that the user can specify them when creating new equipment and generating a work order. </P>
 <H3>11.2.4 New Call (Original Screen)</H3>
 <P>The Log Form Id: field has been added to this screen. It defaults from the Equipment record, but may be changed by the user to select which log form id will be specified on the new work order. </P>

 <P style="margin-left:36.00pt;"><FONT style="font-weight:bold; " >Important Note on Metrics:</FONT> when a work order referencing a log form is created in SAM Pro, metrics will only be written to the work order metrics tab if the Technician is not a TechAnywhere tech (e.g., Remote Access is set to None) or no Tech is specified.  If the work order initially assigned to a technician with remote access, metrics will be uploaded to the technician’s device, and then posted to the work order in SAM Pro when they have been completed in the field.  </P>
 <H2>11.3 Dispatch Board </H2>
 <P>Minor cosmetic changes to the positioning of the top toolbar buttons.</P>
 <P>The Client Site’s Shipping Street Address Line 2 has been added to the lower half of the Dispatch Board. This field will show up near the end of the list if you have customized your Dispatch Board columns. You must drag the field to the desired location. If the column order of the Dispatch Board has not yet been customized, the new field will be positioned between the first street address line and the city.  </P>
 <P>This release corrects a display issue on the Dispatch Board's top toolbar.</P>
 <H3>11.3.1 Filter Tab</H3>
 <P>The Work Order’s Date Closed (on the Invoicing Tab) has been added as a range filter. You can now scroll all the way down the Filter tab instead of having to tab through the ranges.</P>
 <H3>11.3.2 Classic Board</H3>
 <P>In recent releases, if the Classic board was resized, clicking in it would maximize it.  The Classic board now retains the window size that you select. </P>
 <P>The Priority has been added as an editable field to the Work Order edit form that is accessible in the lower pane of the Classic board.&nbsp; </P>
 <P>Corrects a problem that resulted in the Technician Id on the Classic Board’s WO Summary (the lower half of the board) being case sensitive. </P>
 <P>This release<FONT style="font-weight:bold; " > </FONT>corrects an error that occurred in the Classic Board if you clicked the cell one past the last column and that row had a valid WO in the last column.</P>
 <H3>11.3.3 Unavailable Techs Enhancement</H3>
 <P>This release extends the Unavailable Technician functionality to the Classic Board when the Change Orientation button is clicked. Unavailable Techs will now have their row header displayed with a red background. </P>
 <P>The Dispatch board (both Power and Classic) are now able to indicate that a Technician is unavailable. A registry entry is required to turn this functionality on. The Unavailable Days are set in a new tab in the Technician record (see user note 11.11.2). </P>
 <P style="margin-left:36.00pt;"><FONT style="font-weight:bold; " >Classic Board:</FONT> On the Classic board, unavailability is indicated with a red background on the column or row header displaying the Technician’s information for those days that he or she is unavailable. On the Power board, a currently unavailable Technician’s line in the Technician Summary (upper portion of the board) will be displayed in red. </P>
 <P style="margin-left:36.00pt;"><FONT style="font-weight:bold; " >NewCall</FONT><BR>If the Technician and Date scheduled are both entered, a Warning will appear saying the Tech is Unavailable when the New Call is saved.<BR><BR><FONT style="font-weight:bold; " >TechFinder</FONT><BR>In TechFinder, the word ‘OFF’ will appear on the Technician hours pane if the technician is Unavailable.

 <H3>11.3.4 ReleaseWO / Release to Tech button</H3>
 <P>A new registry option allows the user to define the statuses impacted by the ReleaseWO / Release to Tech button on the dispatch board. See user note 2.8.12. </P>
 <H2>11.4 TechFinder </H2>
 <P><FONT style="font-weight:bold; " >Tech Unavailability</FONT><FONT style="font-weight:bold; " >: </FONT>The word ‘OFF’ will appear on the Technician hours pane if the technician is Unavailable. A Warning will appear saying the Tech is Unavailable if you select an Unavailable date.<BR>This enhancement is enabled if the registry option IdentifyUnavailableTechs in sys-viewer-vdsptchbrd is set to true and time off has been entered on the Technician record’s Unavailable tab. </P>
 <P>This release corrects an error that occurred when accessing TechFinder when the selected Work Order’s Service Zone had no Techs assigned to it. </P>
 <P>Corrects spurious error if you flag the Restrict the ‘Techs Already Scheduled in Work Zones’ box.</P>
 <H2>11.5 Archive Workorders</H2>
 <P>The two new functions, Start Archive Work Orders and Start Autoarchive Work Orders are designed to allow high-volume customers to set older Work Orders to an Archived status. The Update Function may need to be run to access these functions. To be eligible for archiving, the Work Order’s Date Closed must be set, and the Escalation Status would typically be set to Billed or Cancelled. </P>
 <P>When Work Order is Archived, a Tech line will be added set to the Log Type of Archive with will override all other statuses when setting the Escalation Status and Status Category. To ‘unarchive’ a Work Order, the user can simply delete or change the ‘archived’ Tech line and save the Work Order. </P>
 <P>Archived Work Orders will not appear on the Dispatch Board, but are still listed in the New Call WO pane. </P>
 <P>A new button, Archived, has been added to the Work Order List; clicking this button filters the list to Archived Work Orders only. </P>
 <H3>11.5.1 Start Autoarchive Work Orders</H3>
 <P>This function is designed to be run as a scheduled event. The following registry options must be in effect. </P>
 <P>Registry setting parameters: </P>
 <P><FONT style="font-weight:bold; " >Id: </FONT>sys-start-sautoarchivewo</P>

 <H2>11.6 Start Create PM Work Orders</H2>
 <P>A new Job Id Range Filter has been added to Start Create PM WOs function. This enables the user to limit this functions to a specific Job or Jobs. This filtering impacts lines entered directly on the Client Site Equipment PM Schedule tab, as well as lines that will be generated from Master Contract. </P>
 <P>When Required Resource processing is enabled for Create PM Work Orders, and the registry options are in order so that Requires Resource lines should be written,  the Equipment Id on the Required Resource line is now completed from the Client Site Equipment record that needed the line.</P>
 <P>If your firm uses required resources, a new registry may be used to prevent the writing of PM parts to the Required Resources tab for non-subcontractor technician (Required Resource lines are <FONT style="font-weight:bold; text-decoration:underline;" >never</FONT> written if the PM is created for a subcontractor technician). See user note 2.11.2 for details. </P>
 <H2>11.7 Scheduled Event Manager</H2>
 <P>This release corrects problems with handling read-only documents. </P>
 <H3>11.7.1 Scheduled Events </H3>
 <P><FONT style="font-weight:bold; " >New button - Fix Tokens</FONT></P>
 <P>If the user wishes to manually release a scheduled event, click this button causes the system to evaluate and replace any tokens. Previously, the user had to manually replace all tokens.</P>
 <H2>11.8  Escalation Profiles</H2>
 <P><FONT style="font-weight:bold; " >New Field: Obsolete<BR></FONT>By default, this field not checked. If it is checked, the record is considered Obsolete. </P>
 <P>Note that although validation logic denies direct entry of obsolete record Ids, the Escalation Manager will continue to use obsolete Escalation Profiles if they are attached to work orders / web logs. </P>
 <P>When you check the Obsolete field, the following message box will be displayed:</P>
 <P>&quot;You have elected to obsolete this record.  Would you like to see existing references to this record?&quot;</P>
 <P>If you click Yes, the system will display a viewer that provides click-through access to all tables referencing this record.  It is strongly recommended that you edit active Client Sites / Equipment to replace Obsolete Escalation Profiles.  </P>
 <H3>11.8.2 Web Log Profiles</H3>
 <P>This enhancement allows escalation management to sense and trigger events based on web log changes (e.g., to Canceled or Duplicate), allowing the user to define escalation profile rules to send email notifications automatically. </P>
 <H2>11.9 Notification Categories </H2>
 <P><FONT style="font-weight:bold; " >New Field: Obsolete<BR></FONT>By default, this field not checked. If it is checked, the record is considered Obsolete. </P>

 <H2>11.11 Technician Viewer </H2>
 <H3>11.11.1 Remote Access Tab</H3>
 <P><FONT style="font-weight:bold; " >Changed Field: Remote Device Type:</FONT></P>
 <P>A new option named 'Android' has been added.</P>
 <P>The option named 'Windows' replaces the old option named 'XP'.&nbsp; Automated data conversion is not necessary as 'XP' and 'Windows' will be equivalents inside the SAMPRO and DB Exchange code.&nbsp; However, when a SAMPRO user loads an XP-type Technician record into the viewer, the following message will be display:</P>
 <P style="margin-left:36.00pt;">This Technician Device Type is being switched from ‘XP’ to ‘Windows’.<BR>Please save the record to make the change permanent.</P>
 <P>The user should click OK to clear the message, and save the Technician record.</P>
 <H3>11.11.2 New Tab – Unavailable</H3>
 <P><FONT style="font-weight:bold; " >Purpose:</FONT></P>
 <P>Specify the days a technician is unavailable for regular work. </P>
 <P><FONT style="font-weight:bold; " >Usage: </FONT></P>
 <P>The Dispatch board (both Power and Classic) are now able to indicate that a Technician is unavailable. A registry entry (see user note 2.28) is required to turn this functionality on. On the Classic board, unavailability is indicated with a red background on the column or row header displaying the Technician’s information for those days that he or she is unavailable. On the Power board, a currently unavailable Technician’s line in the Technician Summary (upper portion of the board) will be displayed in red. </P>

 <H2>11.12 Edit Daily WOs </H2>
 <P>When launched from the Dispatch Board, this function once again uses the<FONT style="font-weight:bold; " > </FONT>statuses selected on that Dispatch Board.  </P>
 <H2>11.13 Start Create PM Billings</H2>
 <P>A new Job Id Range Filter has been added to enable the user to limit this function to a specific Job or Jobs. This filtering impacts lines entered directly on the Client Site PM Billing tab as well as lines that will be generated from Master Contract. </P>
 <H2>11.14 Master Contract</H2>
 <H3>11.14.1 Setup/Renew enhancements</H3>
 <P>In previous releases, the user could not use the AutoPopulate button to adjust Inspection and/or Advanced Billing for the current date range if these lines already existed on the Master Contract: the message  'Start Date cannot precede Original End Date' was displayed. In this release, the user is only restricted from using the AutoPopulate button if any of the existing scheduled or billed lines have been used to generate corresponding lines in the Client Site PM Billing or Client Site Equipment PM tables. Further, if these lines exist, the message has been clarified to display: &quot;Advanced Billing and or Schedule lines have already been generated for this date range; the Start Date cannot precede the original End Date&quot;.</P>
 <P>If the deprecated RemoveValidations registry option is in effect, the “Warning – This action will replace the existing schedule. Any previously generated invoices and work orders will still exist. Are you sure you want to continue?” will be suppressed if the Auto Populate button is pressed but no ‘used’ advanced billing or inspection lines are found.</P>
 <H2>11.15  Web Log </H2>
 <P>The Status field may once again be set by the user.  </P>
 <P><FONT style="font-weight:bold; " >New Field: <BR>Previous Status:  New      Acknowledged      Unacknowledged      Cancelled       Duplicate<BR></FONT>These fields are maintained by the system, and are used in by escalation management to sense and trigger events based on web log changes (e.g.,  to Cancelled or Duplicate), allowing the user to define escalation profile rules to send email notifications automatically</P>
 <H2>11.16 Start Archive Work Orders</H2>
 <H3>Purpose:</H3>
 <P>This function is designed to allow high-volume customers to set older Work Orders to an Archived status. To be eligible for archiving, the Work Order’s Date Closed must be set, and the Escalation Status would typically be set to Billed or Cancelled. </P>
 <P>When Work Order is Archived, a Tech line will be added set to the Log Type of Archive which will override all other statuses when setting the Escalation Status and Status Category. To ‘unarchive’ a Work Order, the user can simply delete or change the ‘archived’ Tech line and save the Work Order. </P>
 <P>Archived Work Orders will not appear on the Dispatch Board, but are still listed in the New Call WO pane. </P>
 <P>A new button, Archived, has been added to the Work Order List; clicking this button filters the list to Archived Work Orders only. </P>
 <H3>Usage:</H3>
 <P>This function may be run by the user to archive selected work orders. </P>
 <P style="margin-left:36.00pt;">Warning: use with caution if many work orders are being archived (e.g, the first time the function is run) – it is a CPU intensive function.  </P>
 <H3>Important Fields: Range Screen</H3>
 <P><FONT style="font-weight:bold; " >Date Opened / Date Closed: <BR></FONT>At least one of these fields must be completed.  Workorders opened on or before the Date Opening, or closed on or before the Date Closed will be archived (subject to entries in the other range fields. </P>

 <H2>11.17 Start Autoarchive Workorders</H2>
 <H3>Purpose:</H3>
 <P>The function Start Autoarchive Work Orders is designed to allow high-volume customers to set older Work Orders to an Archived status. </P>
 <H3>Usage:</H3>
 <P>This function is designed to be run as a scheduled event. The following registry options must be in effect.  Contact your support representative for assistance in setting this up. </P>

 <P>This is the recommended setting. Archiving ‘completed’ work orders with this function is NOT recommended as they may have unbilled costs.</P>
 <H2>11.18 Service Evaluation Enhancement </H2>
 <P style="margin-left:36.00pt;"><FONT style="font-weight:bold; " >Note: Change</FONT><FONT style="font-weight:bold; " >s</FONT><FONT style="font-weight:bold; " > to Default Behavior:<BR></FONT>When a work order is created all service evaluation questions from the Work Order’s Service Evaluation table are moved to the Work Order Evaluation child table and the answers are set to unknown.</P>
 <P style="margin-left:36.00pt;">The Service Evaluation Wizard is now titled as the Unanswered Service Evaluation Wizard. Only unanswered questions (where the answer is set to unknown) will appear on the Wizard. The Wizard will be launched as discussed in section 11.18.1 below. </P>
 <H3>11.18.1 Service Evaluation Record - Category: General (new option)</H3>
 <P>This new option allows the inclusion of general questions to be included in Service Evaluations. The Unanswered Service Evaluation Questions Wizard will be invoked when the Work Order Escalation Status is set to the value (or one of the values) defined in the sys-viewer-vwrkordr registry’s  GeneralEvaluationLogTypes option. Note that all unanswered questions (including Closings and Invoicing questions) will be displayed in the wizard when it is invoked in this fashion. </P>
 <H3>11.18.2 Work Order Service Evaluation Changes</H3>
 <P>When a work order is created all service evaluation questions from the Work Order’s Service Evaluation table are moved to the Work Order Evaluation child table and the answers are set to unknown.</P>
 <P>The name of the Service Evaluation Wizard has been changed to the Unanswered Service Evaluation Wizard because only unanswered questions (answers are set to unknown) will be included when it is run. As is previous releases, the wizard will be invoked when the work order is completed or invoiced. </P>
 <P>In this release, the Unanswered Service Evaluation Questions Wizard will be also be invoked when the Work Order Escalation Status is set to the value (or one of the values) defined in the sys-viewer-vwrkordr registry’s  GeneralEvaluationLogTypes option. All unanswered questions (including Closing, Invoicing  and General questions) will be displayed in the wizard when it is invoked in this fashion. </P>
 <P style="margin-left:36.00pt;">When the wizard pops up based on the registry setting, ALL unanswered questions will appear, but the user is NOT required to answer any of the questions.<BR><BR>When the 'closing' wizard pops up, any unanswered CLOSING or GENERAL-type questions will appear. The user is NOT required to answer any of the questions.<BR><BR> When the 'invoicing' wizard pops up, ALL unanswered questions will appear. The user IS required to answer each question.</P>
 <H3>11.18.3 Registry Entry to Implement</H3>
 <P>A new registry entry is required to implement this enhancement:</P>
 <P>Id: sys-viewer-vwrkordr</P>
 <P>Setting Key: GeneralEvaluationLogTypes  &nbsp;Setting Values: <FONT style="font-style:italic; " >list of work order escalation statuses.</FONT></P>
 <P>When the Workorder is escalated to one of the registry statuses listed, all unanswered questions are displayed in a Wizard and must be answered.</P>
 <H2>11.19  Log Form Lines Viewer (Metrics)</H2>
 <P>Two rows in the same Log Form record may not contain identical Heading and Line contents. This viewer now displays the following error if you attempt to save the record with this situation: “LogFormLinesByDescriptionByParentRn for table ‘lgfrmlne’ would not be unique.” The user must edit the one of the offending row entries to insure its uniqueness before the record can be saved. </P>
 <P>Example: </P>

 <P style="margin-top:0;margin-bottom:0">&nbsp;</P>
 <H1>12. TechAnywhere</H1>
 <P>The sys-ffv-global-settings registry includes an option, BranchSequence = nextwo, that enables a branch prefix to be prepended to the Work Order Id.  TechAnywhere now checks to see if it should use a branch prefix and use it when posting NewWOs message.</P>
 <P>Tech Anywhere now supports<FONT style="font-weight:bold; " > </FONT>COD payments when the message payload contains multiple Workorders.</P>
 <P>This release fixes the handling of Negative Values with a minus sign in first character. Also sets the price for Labor/Inventory and Other lines. The extra flag is set, the billing rate id to 'unit price'.</P>
 <H2>12.1 TechAnywhere Post </H2>
 <P>Corrects issue with Labor Rate erroneously defaulting from the Employee record if the client’s customization includes reordering of the Labor Journal Hours tab. See case for details. </P>
 <P>This release corrects a problem where the Work Order Updates from TechAnywhere caused a WO Tech RN change. Also improves email alert processing. </P>
 <P>Corrects Tech Anywhere intermittent issue posting COD multiple times.</P>
 <P>The posting of new work order messages can now handle the time scheduled of &quot;00:00&quot;, a valid time format for midnight.</P>
 <P>Fixed problem where work orders created from TechAnywhere would have initial status of &quot;Pending&quot; rather than &quot;Unacknowledged&quot;.</P>
 <P>Now properly posts flat rate items from TechAnywhere Android.</P>
 <P>This release reduces the amount of memory required to process TechAnywhere message data. Previously, memory spikes on large messages might cause out of memory errors.</P>
 <P>Inventory from TechAnywhere can be posted to the default accounting period, even if the effective date is outside of the period range. A registry entry is now available to adjust either the date or accounting period to keep them in sync.&nbsp; See user note 2.9.2 for details. </P>
 <P>The system now verifies that a TechAnywhere message contains the following before posting: Date Scheduled, Time Scheduled, Technician Id, Site Id and Equipment Id. If any of these fields are missing, the message fails and sends an email alert.</P>
 <P>The security override from the Work Order is correctly applied to Labor Journal, Purchase Order, Sales Journal, and new Site Equipment records during the TechAnywhere Post UNLESS the record is included in the sys-securityexceptionsbytable registry entry (specifying that its security should be zero).</P>
 <P>In previous releases, all TechAnywhere attachments came in with the Web Viewable CRM, Web Viewable CSR, and Web Viewable Tech flags checked. For signatures captured in TechAnywhere, all 3 are now cleared. </P>
 <P>In this release, the TechAnywhere event manager no longer attempts to re-post messages with the status of &quot;PostedBy User&quot;. This allows clients to resume processing of posting other messages by restarting the TechAnywhere event manager. </P>
 <P>This release corrects the reference number written to the WO COD tab during the TechAnywhere post so that the Check Number (and not the Message Id) is displayed.</P>
 <P>If the amount of data entered into the recommendation field by the tech surpasses the 1024 character limit, SAM Pro truncates the data so it will fit into a weblog and post the message.</P>
 <P>Signature data now removed during the posting, inspecting, or exporting of messages. The signature data is still stored on the receipt that was generated in the field and attached to the SAM Pro records.</P>
 <P>Previously, if<FONT style="font-weight:bold; " > </FONT>an Inventory Item Id was changed and the technicians were not instructed to perform a sync to retrieve inventory, the tech would apply the old ID to Workorders which resulted in the post failing. The system now uses the Inventory RN (internal number)  during the post to the work order and when using required resources.</P>
 <P>Posting Required Resources from Tech Anywhere now sets the Equipment Id.</P>
 <P>The TechAnywhere Post now supports allow multiple payment methods (e.g., the customer pays part in cash, part by credit card).</P>
 <P>Invoices created by TA will use the standard Invoice Next Numbers from Sampro. The Invoice Description field will have the TA Reference Invoice Number (for auditing).</P>
 <P>GL accounts for COD payment entries and the cash receipt are now taken via GL account listed in payment type.</P>
 <H3>12.1.1 Registry Entry for COD Work Orders: do not post to AR Sales / Cash Receipts</H3>
 <P>A new registry Item has been added to allow COD-type work orders to be invoiced from SAM Pro instead of occurring as part of the TechAnywhere post. This allows the back office staff to review the Tech Anywhere COD Invoices before posting to AR. </P>
 <P> <FONT style="font-weight:bold; " >Id: sys-techanywhere</FONT></P>
 <P><FONT style="font-weight:bold; " >Setting Key:</FONT> AutoPostCOD&nbsp;<FONT style="font-weight:bold; " >Setting Value:</FONT> false or true</P>
 <P>The default is true. If the option is absent or set to true, the current default is retained: the post will create an Invoice, AR Sales Journal, and Cash Receipt.</P>
 <P>When the Setting Value is false, the behavior is completely changed. AR Sales Journal, Cash Receipt and Invoice Master records are NOT created. All imported lines come in without an AR invoice reference ID so that they can be billed normally via Service Compute. AR entries can then be created through SAMPro.</P>
 <P style="margin-left:36.00pt;"><FONT style="font-weight:bold; " >Note: </FONT>Previously, AutoPostCOD (false) created a one-sided GL History entry. Now the post no longer creates a one-sided GL history line, or an invoice master with the status of New. The Invoice Master should not be needed as TechAnywhere does not assign invoice IDs as it has in the past.</P>
 <H2>12.2 TechAnywhere Event Manager</H2>
 <P>This release corrects a Tech Anywhere and Scheduled Event Manager Posting Conflict. </P>
 <P>In this release, 'billed' has been added to the list of work order log types that get skipped in the update SQL when the TechAnywhere Event Manager runs. </P>
 <H2>12.3 Remote Tech – Blackberry/Mirifex</H2>
 <P>Corrects problem with Blackberry uploads including a Resolution code. </P>
 <P>Corrects problem where Blackberry/Mirifex Posting was hanging due to Work Order's &quot;open remote techs&quot; warning message.</P>
 <H2>12.4 Start Purge Message Table</H2>
 <P><FONT style="font-weight:bold; " >Important Note:</FONT> The correct registry Id for this function is sys-start-sprgemssge (was previously documented as sys-start-sprgemssgetble). </P>
 <P>This release: adds a commit at the end of processing; corrects a Sybase (-157 error); and implements a progress meter.</P>
 <H1>13. ServiceChannel FMMS</H1>
 <P>This release includes improved support of message handling in New Call. </P>
 <P>This release ensures that the data from multiple ServiceChannel tracking #'s is separated into individual files for proper processing.</P>
 <P>To prevent naming conflicts, the Archive and Reject folders are included in the naming conflict resolution. </P>
 <P>Better handling of bad data occasionally sent to us from ServiceChannel.  </P>
 <P>When the Upload to Service Channel button is pushed in the Quote Viewer, a confirming message ('This Quote has been queued for uploading to ServiceChannel') is displayed. </P>
 <P>Also corrects issue with the Proposal Upload. </P>
 <P>Internal fixes to databridge.</P>
 <P>The Quote upload was only uploading Scopes with a status of 'Open': this has extended to include Scopes with a status of 'Printed'. </P>
 <P>The SAM Pro data are now always updated when an Invoice has been uploaded to Service Channel.</P>
 <P>The Invoice Date uploaded to Service Channel now includes the time using the format 'mm/dd/yyyy hh:mm' where the hh:mm represents the current time.</P>
 <P>The ServiceChannel invoice upload is now successfully gets the User Id and Password from the registry</P>
 <H2>13.1 Message Viewer</H2>
 <P>The Message viewer now hides the message type of FMMS. The default setting of the Message Type range has been changed from !SageQuest to ~SageQuest,FMMS.</P>
 <H2>13.2 Multiple Company/PIN Support</H2>
 <P>This release allows our ServiceChannel FMMS bridge to support multiple companies (ServiceChannel PIN's) if needed. To support this, additional sampro registries can be made in the form of:</P>
 <P>sys-fmms-vendor-ServiceChannel-pin-XXXX<BR><BR>This registry setting should only need to contain the user/password (InvoiceUID &amp; InvoicePWD) options for that particular company (pin), but could be used to override other settings if needed. All other registry settings default from the base registry setting (sys-fmms-vendor-ServiceChannel), and the &quot;pin&quot; registry can be used to override the settings on a pin by pin basis.</P>
 <H1>14. SageQuest</H1>
 <P>When Work Orders were uploaded to SageQuest, they were previously sent using an hours format like “estimatedHours=2.5”. At SageQuest’s request, we now convert estimated hours from hours to seconds before we send it up to them.</P>
 <P><FONT style="font-weight:bold; " >Web Services / Sagequest:</FONT> Internal changes to increase performance.</P>
 <H2>14.1 SageQuest / TechAnywhere </H2>
 <P>TechAnywhere records the date and time that a status change was made. So the tech may make a status change of onsite at noon, but if he is out of range that status change may not get updated till he is in range (let's say 1:30).</P>
 <P>Previously, the TechAnywhere Post updated SageQuest at the time the post occurred. (in our example the post time would be 1:30). The problem was that SageQuest knows when the vehicle arrives (noon) but the status change time is 1:30. This made the Workorder Variance report incorrect. </P>
 <P>To correct this problem,  fields have been added to the Work Order Technician tab with the status change date and time, not the time posted. When TechAnywhere posts it updates these fields with the date and time that a status change was made (noon). The SageQuest integration now uses these fields when they are populated with relevant data to send the correct time up to SageQuest.</P>

 <P><FONT style="font-weight:bold; " >Sa</FONT><FONT style="font-weight:bold; " >ge Quest</FONT><FONT style="font-weight:bold; " >:</FONT> If the Work Order Escalation Status is set to Cancelled, Credit Hold, or Archived, SAM Pro will send a message to SageQuest to say that it is cancelled; the Work Order is then removed from the SageQuest map.</P>
 <H2>14.3 SageQuest Garmin Support</H2>
 <P>The CreateStopForWorkorder functionality is now only called if the status of a work order is changing TO the registry set (stop value). </P>
 <H2>14.4 SageQuest / Client Site </H2>
 <P>This release handles an error that occurred when the Sage Quest interface was on and the user loaded a client site record with the Site Latitude field  is blank, and Work/Ship Street Address includes the @ character.</P>

 <H3>15.1.1 Transfer Tickets</H3>
 <P><FONT style="font-weight:bold; " >Shop Order Transfer Ticket – New Fields<BR>Full Orders Only</FONT><BR>If this field is checked, only Shop Order Transfer Tickets for Full Orders will be printed. The definition of a Full Order is: </P>
 <P style="margin-left:36.00pt;">1. All BOM items are released to pick<BR>2. No BOM items are on backorder for the shop order</P>
 <P><FONT style="font-weight:bold; " >Work Order Id:<BR>Work Order Type:</FONT><BR>These range fields have been added to enable the user to filter Shop Order Transfer tickets to those generated by Material Requisitioning. For example, to print tickets for only those Shop Orders generated by Service Work Orders, you would enter the word Service in the Work Order Type range. To limit the tickets to those generated by PM Work Orders, enter P% in the Work Order Type Range. </P>
 <P>The Work Order Id range can be used to generate the Shop Order Transfer Tickets for a specific Work Order, or several Work Orders as a comma-delimited list&nbsp; (11101, 11154, 11213).</P>
 <H3>11.1.2 Shop Order Pick List Entry</H3>
 <P>This release corrects reversing logic when a line is deleted so that the default date and accounting period are set correctly.  </P>
 <H2>15.2 Client Order </H2>
 <P><FONT style="font-weight:bold; " >COP Sales Tax Handling:</FONT> The system now allows changes to Sales Tax Group in Client Orders. The Client Site COP Tax Exempt field in tax calculations is now included in COP Invoice calculations. If this box is flagged, sales tax will not be included on the COP Invoice.</P>
 <P>When COP orders are invoiced, extraneous pricing lines (with only a GL Entity and a Revenue Type) are no longer written to the AR Sales Journal.   </P>
 <P>The GL Entity for lines designated as Drop Ship PO is now transferred to the PO that is generated. </P>
 <H3>15.2.1 Items Tab</H3>
 <P>This version includes assorted enhancements to make this work as described below:</P>
 <P style="margin-left:36.00pt;"><FONT style="font-weight:bold; " >Enhanced </FONT><FONT style="font-weight:bold; " >Substitute Item Number Functionality:<BR></FONT><FONT style="font-weight:bold; " >1. </FONT>When entering an order line, enter the item number the customer thinks he is getting in the Inventory Item Id field – not the Substitute Item Field. This will properly load up the item description and the cost for the last time the customer ordered that item. It will also set the Substitute item number to the item number entered.</P>
 <P style="margin-left:36.00pt;"><FONT style="font-weight:bold; " >2.</FONT> Then, change the item number in the Inventory Item Id field to the item number actually to be shipped. </P>
 <P style="margin-left:36.00pt;"><FONT style="font-weight:bold; " >3.</FONT> The system will ask if you want to copy this to the substitute item number field. Answer ‘No’.</P>
 <P style="margin-left:36.00pt;"><FONT style="font-weight:bold; " >4.</FONT> Proceed as usual. At this point, the first field on the child tab is the 'actual' item number. That is, this is the item that is withdrawn from inventory. The 'substitute' part number only appears on paperwork. The customer thinks that they are getting the 'substitute' item but they are really getting the 'actual' item.</P>
 <P style="margin-left:36.00pt;">The ‘substitute’ item will appear on the COP Invoice and Order Acknowledgement that is sent to the customer.  </P>
 <P style="margin-left:36.00pt;">On the Pick Ticket, the first page lists the Substitute Item so that this page may be sent to the customer as a packing slip. The second page of the Pick Ticket is flagged as “INTERNAL COMMENTS – DO NOT SHIP THIS PAGE TO CLIENT”, and shows the part substitution as follows:</P>
 <P style="margin-left:66.25pt;">***** PART NUMBER SUBSTITUTION *****</P>
 <P style="margin-left:66.25pt;">For this Part Number&nbsp;Substitute this Part</P>
 <P style="margin-left:66.25pt;">123100*&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;123105</P>
 <H3>15.2.2  Cancelling Client Orders</H3>
 <P>In this release, a Client Order may be cancelled if a Pick Ticket has not been printed for any of the Items on the order.  Cancelling an order will automatically reverse its backorders/allocations from IM history. </P>
 <P>COP Processing has been disabled for Cancelled Orders as follows: </P>
 <P style="margin-left:36.00pt;">Pick Tickets cannot be printed for Cancelled Orders.<BR>View Client Pick List Entry is disabled for Cancelled Orders.<BR>View Client Order To Ship is disabled for Cancelled Orders. </P>
 <P><FONT style="font-weight:bold; " >New Fields: Client Order Parent Screen</FONT></P>
 <P><FONT style="font-weight:bold; " >Cancelled Date:  Cancelled By: <BR></FONT>These fields may only be completed if a Pick Ticket has not yet been printed for any of the items on the order. When you save this Order with these fields completed, it will be Cancelled and the system will automatically reverse its backorders/allocations from IM history</P>
 <P><FONT style="font-weight:bold; " >New Tab: IM History</FONT></P>
 <P>This tab displays a summary of the Inventory History for this client order. If you cancel a Client Order by completing the Cancelled Date and Cancelled by fields, existing allocations/backorders for this order will be reversed, and this tab will be blank. </P>
 <P><FONT style="font-weight:bold; " >New Tab: Pick Tickets</FONT></P>
 <P>This tab displays the Pick Ticket detail for this order. If you cancel a Client Order by completing the Cancelled Date and Cancelled By fields, pick tickets are no longer applicable for this order, and this tab will be blank. </P>
 <P><FONT style="font-weight:bold; " >Client</FONT><FONT style="font-weight:bold; " > Order Range</FONT><FONT style="font-weight:bold; " > View</FONT></P>
 <P><FONT style="font-weight:bold; " >New Range: Date Cancelled<BR></FONT>A new range, Date Cancelled, has been added to the range view.  This range is prefilled to exclude orders cancelled today (and in the past) from the list of Active Client Orders. </P>
 <H2>15.3 Fill Shop Backorders</H2>
 <P>This version corrects a problem with partially filled shop backorders. </P>
 <P>Also corrects a sporadic problem handling negative quantities. </P>
 <H2>15.4 Shop Order</H2>
 <P>The Transfer Qty BO'd has been added to the BOM full screen view of the Shop Order.&nbsp;</P>
 <H2>15.5 Shop Order (Transfer Ticket) Pick List Entry</H2>
 <P>Entering a non-zero value in the Qty Transferred field now forces the Transfer Done field to True: this field must be flagged for correct processing.</P>
 <P style="margin-top:0;margin-bottom:0">&nbsp;</P>
 <H1>16. Requisitioning</H1>
 <H2>16.1 WO Material Requisition Wizard</H2>
 <P>Corrects a problem where the last line on the Work Order Required Resource tab was generated to a different po from the other lines - even though they were tagged for the same vendor and location.</P>
 <P>Corrects ‘date string must be 8 characters’ error when running the wizard launched by the Material Requisition button in the Work Order viewer. </P>
 <H2>16.2 Tech Material Pickup (Start Workorder Material Pickup) </H2>
 <P>The ‘To’ location is now a required field. </P>
 <P style="margin-top:0;margin-bottom:0">&nbsp;</P>
 <H1>17. CRMAnywhere</H1>
 <H2>17.1 Quote Page</H2>
 <P>The sidebar graphic now correctly appears on the Print Quote page. The Quote now also supports the CRMReportType registry option of pdf; if this option is implemented, the Quote itself will be displayed in pdf format.</P>
 <P>The Quote page now displays tables for Quote and Site attachments that are flagged as CRM Viewable.  </P>
 <H2>17.2 View Invoice Page</H2>
 <P>If the user clicked the link “View Invoice PDF” before the PDF had been generated, the 404 page not found error appeared. The software now waits a bit before attempting to display the file. </P>
 <H2>17.3 CRM Anywhere / CSR Anywhere Header Graphics</H2>
 <P>This enhancement may be enabled to improve the way the page headers in CRMAnywhere and CSRAnywhere are handled. Modifications to your existing graphics will be needed to support the change.</P>
 <P>When these functions were first implemented, lower resolution screens were the norm, and the CSRAnywhere and CRMAnywhere headers were designed be left justified on 600X800 pixel screens, with the HTML generated by SAM Pro centered.</P>
 <P>To be more suitable for larger screen, the following registry entry may be used to enable the centering of headers with an appropriate background graphic, and a right-justified graphic to complete the screen:</P>
 <P>Id: web-settings<BR>Setting Key: NewHeaders  Setting Value: true</P>
 <P>If this registry is implemented, changes will need to be made to existing graphics – be sure to save the original versions of all graphics first:</P>
 <P>1. The right-hand side of a header gif should be cropped and saved as right.gif. This graphic will appear at the right-hand side of the header for all pages. </P>
 <P>2. The portion of the header gif’s containing the title (e.g., Main Menu, View Quotes, etc.) should be cropped to remove the left and right portions of the graphics, and resaved under their original name. These graphics will be centered in header.</P>
 <P>3. A one or two pixel wide vertical slice of the graphic’s background should be cropped and saved as slice.gif. This graphic will be repeated as the header background.</P>
 <P>The web server should be restarted after the registry change has been made and the revised graphics installed. </P>
 <P><IMG src="images/crmheaders.gif" border="0" height="595" width="503" alt="images\crmheaders.gif"> </P>
 <H2>17.4  CRMAnywhere Open Requests Page</H2>

 <H2>17.5 CRMAnywhere – Appointment Confirmation</H2>
 <P>This enhancement is designed to allow customers (typically residential customers not normally set up with a full Web User account for CRMAnywhere) to log on via an email link and confirm or reject an appointment for a service call. The customer will receive an email generated via escalation manager that will include a link to the CRMAnywhere Appointment Confirmation page; once there they can confirm or reject the appointment. </P>
 <H3>17.5.1 Graphics Setup</H3>
 <P>A banner for the Confirm Appointment page, named appointment.gif, and a sidebar logo named sidebarLogoOnly. They should conform to the standards for the other CRMAnywhere banners and sidebars:</P>
 <P>If the web-settings registry specifies the New Headers format (Setting Key: NewHeaders  Setting Value: true): </P>
 <P style="margin-left:36.00pt;">The right-hand side of the header should be named right.gif. It should be 68 pixels high, and wide enough to display the desired graphic. This graphic is also used in the other CRMAnywhere screens.</P>
 <P style="margin-left:36.00pt;">The gif containing the title (e.g., Confirm Appointment) should be wide enough to display the appropriate title, and be 68 pixels high. This graphic will be centered in the header, and must be named appointment.gif. </P>
 <P style="margin-left:36.00pt;">A one or two pixel wide and 68 pixel high vertical slice of the graphic’s background should be named slice.gif. This graphic will be repeated as the header background, and is used in the other CRMAnywhere pages.</P>
 <P style="margin-left:36.00pt;">A sidebar area - 112 pixels wide by 440 pixels high, named sidebarLogoOnly.gif.  Note that a menu will NOT appear on the sidebar in the Confirm Appointment screen.</P>
 <P>If the web-settings registry does NOT specify the New Headers format: </P>
 <P style="margin-left:36.00pt;">The gif containing the title (e.g., Confirm Appointment) should be wide enough to display the appropriate title, and be 68 pixels high and of the same width as your other CRMAnywhere banners. This graphic will be left-justified against the sidebar graphic. It should be named appointment.gif. </P>
 <P style="margin-left:36.00pt;">A sidebar area - 112 pixels wide by 440 pixels high, named sidebarLogoOnly.gif.  Note that a menu will NOT appear on the sidebar in the Confirm Appointment screen.</P>
 <H3>17.5.2  Registry</H3>
 <P>This registry setting is required to implement the Appointment Confirmation functionality.</P>

 <H3>Statuses for Confirmed and Rejected Work Order</H3>
 <P>These options control the status changes that will occurred when the customer confirms or rejects the appointment.  Only WO Tech lines with the Date/Time Scheduled that match the web page get updated to the new status. The WO Escalation Status gets updated when the WO is escalated which happens shortly after updating the WO Tech lines.</P>

 <P class="support" style="margin-top:0;margin-bottom:0">&nbsp;</P>
 <H3>17.5.3 Web User Account for Appointment Confirmation</H3>
 <P>A Web User account must be set up for use as the guest account.&nbsp; The Web User Id and Password must be consistent with the registry settings.  It is not necessary to specify the Web Profile. </P>
 <H3>17.5.4  Escalation Profile</H3>
 <P>New Token: ^confirmappointmentlink^</P>
 <P>A new Escalation Profile token has been implemented as part of this enhancement.&nbsp; The token entered into the profile should read ^confirmappointmentlink^.&nbsp; This token will be replaced by a web link to the guest page when the scheduled event executes; the customer will simply click this link to access the Appointment Confirmation page. </P>
 <P>The link consists of these components: the URL from the registry entry, the guest account login from the registry, the work order id and rn, and the scheduled event id which generated the e-mail.  The id, rn and event values are extracted from the link and used to 'authenticate' the incoming request.&nbsp; SQL statements confirm that the values make sense relative to one another.&nbsp; Access is denied when the link's values are not successfully authenticated.</P>
 <P style="margin-left:30.25pt;"><FONT style="text-decoration:underline;" >Example: Escalation Profile</FONT></P>

 <P>If confirmed, the work order status will change to &quot;scheduled&quot; (or any value you set).</P>
 <P>If rejected, the work order status will change to &quot;Rescheduled&quot; (or any value you set).</P>
 <H2>17.6 Site View Page </H2>
 <P>In previous releases, if the registry option disablecrmmanagequotes was set to true in the web-settings registry to remove the Manage Quotes page, the Quote table was also suppressed in the Site View page.  In this release, the Quote table is also suppressed in the Site View page when this option is implemented in the registry tab of the Web Profile or Web User record.</P>
 <P style="margin-top:0;margin-bottom:0">&nbsp;</P>
 <H1>18. CSR Anywhere </H1>
 <H2>18.1 Logon Screen</H2>
 <P>The system displays the message 'No user record found for the employee linked to this technician' if the Employee Id in the Tech record does not link to a User record. The web server remains running.</P>
 <P>The Web Security<FONT style="font-weight:bold; " > </FONT>viewer has been added back to the viewer function list for use with CSRAnywhere – note that you may need to run Start Function List Update to see this viewer, and assign it to the appropriate user groups.</P>
 <H2>18.2 Quote Pages </H2>
 <P>If you add an option to an existing quote, the Quote's Status and Status Category are now correctly updated if adding the option should have changed them.  In addition, the Quote's record change log is updated with the date, time, userid and a description of CSRAnywhere.</P>
 <P>The Description field on the Manage Open Leads/Quotes Options page has been repositioned as the last data-entry field on the page. This will prevent its being overwritten when the user enters the Unit Cost or Other Rate Id when tabbing through the fields. </P>
 <P>This page<FONT style="font-weight:bold; " > </FONT>now displays the Site’s work/shipping address instead of the obsolete mailing address.</P>
 <P>CSR's can mark Quotes options &quot;declined&quot;.</P>
 <P>CSR's can select the Quote Reason Id for options.</P>
 <P>The ability to print quotes from CSRAnywhere has been added.  </P>

 <H3>7.3.498.078</H3>
 <P><FONT style="font-weight:bold; " >Important Installation Note</FONT><FONT style="font-weight:bold; " >:</FONT> The zip file for this release<FONT style="font-weight:bold; " > </FONT>includes a file containing all bitmap definitions in the image (master~pushbuttons.obj) and an executable image (v.exe) stripped of all bitmaps. The bitmaps will be loaded at runtime from the master~pushbuttons.obj file and the SKIN1 directory (if bitmap skinning is in effect). Running this release requires the presence of the change.log, recover.log and master~pushbuttons.obj files in the same directory as the image (v.exe) file. This configuration should allow XP users to run without ‘non-continuable protection fault errors’.</P>
 <P><FONT style="font-weight:bold; " >Import</FONT><FONT style="font-weight:bold; " >ant</FONT><FONT style="font-weight:bold; " > Note on Colors:</FONT> In order to fully support Bitmap Skinning, users’ computer display settings must be set to 24 or 32 bit color.  If the Color Quality is set to 16 bit (Medium in XP, or High Color in Windows 7), the new bitmaps will appear with their standard, pale gray background, but the registry settable background and mouse over color changes will not appear.  Setting the Color Quality to 24 or 32 bit should provide the full bitmap skinning functionality. </P>
 <P><FONT style="font-weight:bold; " >VM Memory:</FONT> SAM Pro’s Smalltalk virtual memory has been expanded to 250MB from 150MB.  This should better support the running of extremely long reports and the unfiltered display of large record viewers without encountering out of memory errors. </P>
 <P><FONT style="font-weight:bold; " >Viewers</FONT><FONT style="font-weight:bold; " > (General)</FONT><FONT style="font-weight:bold; " >: </FONT></P>
 <P style="margin-left:36.00pt;">In this release, History record viewers will start at the Range screen to avoid the unnecessary load time need to display the entire list of entries.  In previous releases, the registry entry sys-startscreen-filter was required to implement this functionality.  </P>
 <P style="margin-left:36.00pt;">This release eliminates a sporadic problem where the Change Record message displayed twice when leaving a record without saving your changes.</P>
 <P style="margin-left:36.00pt;">This release corrects a problem where the wrong sidebar appeared when the Refresh button was clicked in the Client Site Equipment and Job Billing Item viewers</P>
 <P style="margin-left:36.00pt;">The error ‘Not enough storage is available to process this command. ( OS error 16r8 )’ may occur if the user’s systems do not support the bitmap cloning associated with the new skins. In this release, bitmap cloning is disabled when the 'sys-gui' registry not available, a Skin Id is not specified, and when logging in as the support user. Note that the User’s Registry Tab may be used to turn skinning off or on by user.</P>
 <P style="margin-left:36.00pt;">In previous releases, the mouse over box drawn around bitmaps was not always removed when the mouse was quickly run over a series of buttons.  This problem has been corrected so that these “leftover” boxes no longer appear when the mouse has moved off of the button.  </P>
 <P style="margin-left:36.00pt;">This release extends the ability to successfully create a named range to history viewers opened at the filter screen. </P>

 <P><FONT style="font-weight:bold; " >AR </FONT><FONT style="font-weight:bold; " >Sales Journal:</FONT> Validation has been added to prevent the user from changing the Entry Type on an existing entry.

 <P><FONT style="font-weight:bold; " >Quotes:</FONT> Validation currently disallows changes to all scope lines (and the detail lines associated with the scope) unless the status is set to Open, forcing the user to first change the status to Open to make changes. A registry setting allows changes to Accepted options; see user note 2.3.4 for details.  </P>
