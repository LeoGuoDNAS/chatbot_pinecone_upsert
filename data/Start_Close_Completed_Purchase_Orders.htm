<h1>Start Close Completed Purchase Orders</h1>
<h2>Purpose:</h2>
<p>This Starter function allows users to &#39;mass close&#39; PO&#39;s.</p>
<p>The updating process sets the PO&#39;s Received-in-Full flag, changes the PO Status to Closed and sets the Date Closed field if it has not been completed.  The function also determines which POs have been vouchered-in-full. The PO Vouchered-in-Full flag is also set during the update process if applicable.</p>
<p>See <a href="Start_Close_Open_POs.htm">Start Close Open POs</a> for information on this related function.</p>
<h2>Usage:</h2>
<p>Eligibility is determined as follows:</p>
<p>1. Credit-type POs are eligible, however the criteria for closing a credit-type PO is based on vouchered-in-full instead of received-in-full.  A PO Type Range been added to the so that the user can elect to include only Purchase or Credit type Purchase Orders.</p>
<p>2. Since a PO must be fully received prior to becoming fully vouchered, it can be closed before reaching the fully vouchered state.  For this reason, previously closed POs that haven&#39;t been fully vouchered are now included in the check list so that they can be flagged as fully vouchered. If the Data Closed was previously set, it will not be changed by this function. If it was previously blank, it will be set to today’s date.</p>
<p>3. The PO has to have one or more child lines.</p>
