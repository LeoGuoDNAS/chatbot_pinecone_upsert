<h1>Shop Order Viewer</h1>
<h2>Purpose:</h2>
<p>Create and maintain shop orders used for an item or assembly that must 
 be manufactured for a client or for stocking purposes. For an overview 
 of the steps required to take a shop order from initial created to transferring 
 the manufactured item back into stock, click on <a href="Shop_Order_Overview.htm">Shop 
 Order Overview</a>.</p>
<p>Shop Orders are also automatically generated as part of the Requisitioning 
 process. See <a href="Material_Requisitioning_Overview_and_Setup.htm">Requisitioning 
 Overview</a> for details.</p>
<h2>Usage:</h2>
<p>This viewer is required to create and modify shop orders for items that 
 must be assembled. The PO Reorder Advice Report will specify which items 
 must be manufactured (and therefore must have Shop Orders created). If 
 a manufactured item is itself comprised of several subassemblies, this 
 information will be automatically entered into the system when the first 
 Shop Order is created. The new subassemblies will appear on the next day&#39;s 
 PO Reorder Advice report, which will be used to generate shop orders for 
 the subassemblies. The items on the shop order must be flagged as Released 
 to Pick in order for a Transfer Ticket to be printed.</p>
<p><font style="font-weight: bold;">Note:</font> Omitting Transfers: depending 
 upon the way in which your firm operates, you may choose to employ the 
 Omit Transfers option which simulates the procedures normally completed 
 by printing and entering a transfer ticket.</p>
<p><font style="font-weight: bold;">Shop Order Modes<br/>
</font>There are several methods of handling Shop Order creation and closure 
 that are controlled by your customization file and/or registry entries. 
 The most typical mode is discussing in the following help topic: <a href="Registry_Entry_Shop_Order_Mode.htm">Registry 
 Entry Shop Order Mode</a> For additional information, contact your support 
 representative.</p>
<h2>Example:</h2>
<p>Create a shop order for gadget1, a manufactured item.</p>
<h2>Important Fields:</h2>
<p>This viewer is divided into two sections. The upper section includes 
 the header information for the order: Job Id, Job Cost Code, etc.</p>
<h2>Upper Section:</h2>
<p class="Tab" style="background-color: #e5e5e5; border-top: 1.50pt solid #000000; 
	 border-bottom: 1.50pt solid #000000; border-left: 1.50pt solid #000000; 
	 border-right: 1.50pt solid #000000;">Main Tab</p>
<p><font style="font-weight: bold;">Order Id:</font><br/>
If you are running in an inventory-centric (keystone mode), this field 
 will be completed for you when you save this record. If you are not running 
 in this mode, you will need to enter an id. It is recommended that the 
 Shop Order and Job Order Id&#39;s be related. For example, if you were creating 
 Shop Orders for Job 1098, you might create shop orders with Id&#39;s 1098-1, 
 1098-2 and so on.</p>
<p><font style="font-weight: bold;">Order Description</font><br/>
Briefly describes this order for internal use.</p>
<p><font style="font-weight: bold;">Inventory Item Id:</font><br/>
The item to be assembled.</p>
<p><font style="font-weight: bold;">Quantity:</font><br/>
The quantity of the item to be assembled. The Quantity is constrained to 
 zero or one if the item being manufactured is serialized. Shop Orders 
 automatically generated via Requisitioning</p>
<p><font style="font-weight: bold;">Location Id:</font><br/>
Identifies the location in your firm where the item will be assembled. 
 Generally, you would create a Location corresponding to the Job Id for 
 the assembly.</p>
<p class="Body_Text"><font style="font-weight: bold;">Transfer From Location:</font><br/>
Identifies the location where the parts and components for this item are 
 to be transferred from. In general, this will be your main warehouse or 
 stocking location.</p>
<p class="Body_Text"><font style="font-weight: bold;">Released to Pick<br/>
</font>This a sticky field; it will default to the last value you entered 
 when you create a new shop order. If you check this box <font style="font-weight: bold;">before</font> 
 entering the Inventory Item Id in the Main tab, all items imported from 
 its BOM tab will be flagged as Released to Pick (you must click the magnify 
 button to see this field). This box may only be checked if you are using 
 the job-centric model and Omit Transfers is clear. If you are adding new 
 entries directly to the detail section (in the lower part of the screen), 
 check this box for all additions to be flagged as ‘Released to Pick’ automatically.</p>
<p><font style="font-weight: bold;">New Srl Nmbr:<br/>
</font>This field enables you to assign a serial number to the serialized 
 item you are creating with this shop order. This field may only be entered 
 if the actual serial number is empty. (Note: It may never be filled in 
 the Keystone customization. This is NOT the Keystone mode in the registry 
 entry.) If it is filled in, a new serial/lot master will be created when 
 the record is saved and that serial number will be then appear in the 
 parent window. If it is not filled in, a new serial/lot number will be 
 assigned by the system.</p>
<p><font style="font-weight: bold;">Date Required:</font><br/>
The date that this item is required by. You may enter this date in mmddyyyy 
 format from the keyboard, or press Alt+F7 (or double-click on the field) 
 to display the Calendar viewer.</p>
<p><font style="font-weight: bold;">Date Promised:<br/>
</font>The date you promised the customer this item.</p>
<p><font style="font-weight: bold;">Date Entered: Time Entered: Entered 
 By:</font><br/>
These display-only fields are maintained by the system.</p>
<p><font style="font-weight: bold;">Date Closed:</font>  <font style="font-weight: bold;">Close 
 Cost:</font><br/>
If this is an Omit Transfer Shop Order, only the Date Closed field should 
 be entered by the user.</p>
<p>In some customizations (e.g., Keystone) these fields should be filled 
 in when this item has been completed, since doing so will relieve the 
 parts/components at the assembly location and transfer the assembled item(s) 
 to the location specified. Doing so closed the shop order (it is not to 
 use the Shop Order Journal to do so). Note that the Date Closed will be 
 used as the Effective Date on the system-generated journal entries. The 
 Close Cost must match the BOM Cost.</p>
<p><font style="font-weight: bold;">Period Id:<br/>
</font>This field must completed if the Date Closed is entered; it will 
 be used when the system generates journal entries for the transfers. Note 
 that the Date Closed must fall within the Start and End dates of the accounting 
 period that you have selected.</p>
<p><img src="assets/images/image/printshoppacket.gif" alt="image\printshoppacket.gif" title="image\printshoppacket.gif" width="100" height="17" align="left" border="0"/> This button links to the Shop Packet report. The 
 report will launch, filtered for this Shop Order, if it has been imported 
 into your database.</p>
<p><img src="assets/images/image/fillbackorders.gif" alt="image\fillbackorders.gif" title="image\fillbackorders.gif" width="100" height="17" border="0"/> Clicking this button moves 
 BO’d quantities, where possible, to Allocated. This feature is especially 
 useful your shop orders are initially created (via registry) with all 
 quantities initially set to Back Orders. The Shop Order should be saved 
 after implementing this function.</p>
<p><img src="assets/images/image/printtransferticket.gif" alt="image\printtransferticket.gif" title="image\printtransferticket.gif" width="100" height="17" border="0"/> Clicking this button launches Report Transfer Ticket, 
 filtered for this shop order. Click Refresh after printing this report 
 and returning to this viewer.</p>
<p><img src="assets/images/image/recordtransferticket.gif" alt="image\recordtransferticket.gif" title="image\recordtransferticket.gif" width="100" height="17" border="0"/> Clicking this button launches the Record Transfer 
 Ticket function. Click Refresh after completing recording the transfer 
 and returning to this viewer.</p>
<p><img src="assets/images/image/recomputeshoporder.gif" alt="image\recomputeshoporder.gif" title="image\recomputeshoporder.gif" width="100" height="17" align="left" border="0"/> Click this button if the Bill of Material in the 
 Inventory Item record has changed and you wish this Shop Order to reflect 
 the revised Inventory Item values.</p>

 button allows a Shop Order to be canceled. This functionality is only 
 allowed if the Transfers Printed and Transfers Recorded boxes are NOT 
 checked.</span></p>
<p style="font-weight: bold;"><span style="font-weight: normal;">When 
 it is clicked, the quantities allocated or back ordered will be zeroed, 
 and the Date Closed will be set to today. If the Work Order Id is set, 
 the Requisitioned flag and Shop Order Id on the Work Order&#39;s ReqResources 
 tab will be cleared. This provides a way of undoing the Start Materials 
 Requisitioning function which generated the Shop Order.</span></p>

<p><font style="font-weight: bold;">Extended Description:</font><br/>
This optional field may be used to enter user notes on this order. These 
 notes will be printed on the transfer ticket.</p>
<p><font style="font-weight: bold;">Omit Transfers</font><br/>
If you are running in inventory-centric mode, this box will be checked. 
 If so, the system will automatically simulate the procedures normally 
 completed by printing and entering a transfer ticket, allocating the BOM 
 parts in the Transfer From location. When you filled in the Date Closed 
 and save the record, the system will post to GL using information in the 
 Inventory Group record associated with the Asset Account (debit) for the 
 master item being created. In addition, the system will credit the Asset 
 Account of the Inventory Group(s) associated with the raw materials or 
 components. Finally, the appropriate quantity will be transferred to the 
 Location designated in this Shop Order record.</p>
<p class="Body_Text" style="margin-left: 36.00pt;"><font style="font-weight: bold;">Note:</font> 
 if this box is checked, you cannot flag the Released to Pick field.</p>

<p><font style="font-weight: bold;">This tab is used for job-centric shop 
 order processing only.  It is NOT completed for shop orders generated 
 by Materials Requisitioning.</font></p>
<p><font style="font-weight: bold;">Job Id:</font><br/>
This required field identifies the Job this order is for. Enter a valid 
 Job Id or press Alt+F7 (or double-click on this field) to select from 
 a list of Jobs. If this Job is associated with a project, the display-only 
 Project Id and Name fields will default from the Job record.</p>

 Alt+F7 (or double-click on this field) to select from a list.</p>
<p><font style="font-weight: bold;">Job Cost Category Id:</font><br/>
Select a Job Cost Category with a Cost Type of Material or 
 Equipment for this field. This 
 field supports enhanced filtering provided by the Cost Code&#39;s Job Cost 
 Category Usage Filter.</p>
<h2>Important Fields Lower Section:</h2>
<p>When the inventory item being assembled is specified in the header (upper) 
 section of the Shop Order record, its component parts and sub-assemblies 
 will automatically be filled in from the BOM (Bill of Material) tab. The 
 detail lines in a Shop Order can be directly changed, added or deleted 
 if the BOM was incorrect. When a Shop Order is saved, the components will 
 be ordered by Inventory Item Id.</p>
<p><font style="font-weight: bold;" color="#000080">TIP:</font> Update 
 the BOM of the Inventory Item being assembled (if this is a permanent 
 change) and then click the Recompute button to revise the Shop Order.</p>
<p class="Tab" style="background-color: #e5e5e5; border-top: 1.50pt solid #000000; 
	 border-bottom: 1.50pt solid #000000; border-left: 1.50pt solid #000000; 
	 border-right: 1.50pt solid #000000;">BOM Tab</p>
<p>Note: the system will prevent deletion of BOM lines where the &#39;Qty Transfer 
 Ticket Recorded&#39; is greater than zero.</p>
<p>The system validates that a valid Inventory Item Id has been entered 
 on the BOM tab when the user attempts to tab out of the line or Save or 
 Add the record.</p>
<p>The system now denies the deletion of BOM lines whose transfer has been 
 recorded. In addition, changes cannot be made to shop orders with unfilled 
 transfers (the transfer ticket has been printed but not yet recorded).</p>
<p>Users are not allowed to CLOSE a shop order which has un-transferred 
 ITEMS on the BOM and whose status is: TRANSFERS PENDING. If the Shop Order 
 is ready to be closed and the Date or Cost fields have already been set, 
 the user should clear the Date Closed and Cost Closed, delete any lines 
 which have not yet been transferred, and save the work order. Once the 
 Shop Order has been saved and the status set to Transfers Records, a Closed 
 Date and Cost may be entered, and the Shop Order saved again as closed.</p>
<p><font style="font-weight: bold;">Inventory Item Id:</font><br/>
A component or part required to complete this shop order. This field defaults 
 from the Bill of Material of the Item being assembled, but may be changed 
 by the user as needed. The display only Unit of Measure and Inventory 
 Item Name fields will appear when this field is completed. The system 
 recomputes backorder &amp; allocation quantities when component id&#39;s are 
 changed in this field.</p>
<p><font style="font-weight: bold;">Qty Req&#39;d</font><br/>
The actual number of this part or component that is required for this shop 
 order. This field defaults from the Bill of Material of the item being 
 assembled, but may be changed by the user if needed.</p>
<p style="margin-left: 36.00pt;"><font style="font-weight: bold;">Validations 
 Note:</font> the system will prevent changes to this field when the &#39;Qty 
 Transfer Ticket Printed&#39; is greater than zero (Transfer Ticket must  be 
 recorded first). It will also prevent the Quantity Required from being 
 less than &#39;Qty Transfer Ticket Recorded&#39;.</p>
<p><font style="font-weight: bold;">Qty Alloc:<br/>
</font>This field defaults from the Required field.</p>
<p><font style="font-weight: bold;">Qty Avail: Qty Rjcted: BOrd:<br/>
</font> These display-only fields are maintained by the system. The Qty 
 Avail: field shows how many of this item have been reserved for this shop 
 order (by running the Fill Shop Backorders function). The Qty Rejected 
 field displays information on rejected lot-controlled items. Finally, 
 the BOrd field shows how many of these items are on backorder for this 
 shop order.</p>
<p><font style="font-weight: bold;">Description:</font><br/>
This optional field may be used to enter a brief description for informational 
 purposes.</p>
<p class="Tip_Note_Heading" style="margin-top: 4.00pt;">Serial #:<br/>
<font style="font-weight: normal;">When you double-click this field, the 
 serial/lot number will be filtered to only those for the selected Inventory 
 Item number.</font></p>
<p><font style="font-weight: bold;">Unit Cost: Extended Cost:<br/>
</font>The cost of this component; these fields default from the Inventory 
 Item record, but may be adjusted by the user if needed.</p>
<p><img src="assets/images/image/Magnify.gif" alt="image\Magnify.gif" title="image\Magnify.gif" width="18" height="18" border="0"/></p>
<p>The following fields appear of the detail view of of the line, accessed 
 by clicking the about button.</p>
<p><font style="font-weight: bold;">Released?</font><br/>
Flag this field if these items are to be released to this Shop Order. Double-click 
 on this field (or press the Spacebar) to flag or clear it. Items will 
 not be allocated to this Shop Order unless this field is flagged. This 
 enables you to set up a Shop Order, but delay actually implementing it 
 until the time is right.</p>
<p><font style="font-weight: bold;">Released</font><br/>
The date that these items are released to this shop order. This field will 
 default to today&#39;s date.</p>
<p><font style="font-weight: bold;">Released to Pick?</font><br/>
Flag this field if these items should be transferred to the shop order 
 assembly location. Double-click on this field (or press the Spacebar) 
 to flag or clear it. A shop order transfer ticket will not print unless 
 this field is flagged.</p>
<p style="margin-left: 36.00pt;"><font style="font-weight: bold;">Tip:</font>
