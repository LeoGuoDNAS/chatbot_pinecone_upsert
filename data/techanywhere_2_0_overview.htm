<H1>TechAnywhere 2.0 Overview</H1>
 <H2>Basic Components</H2>
 <P>As the following illustration depicts, TechAnywhere requires your SAM Pro servers and software, wireless technician devices and TechAnywhere software, and a server to manage secure communications between the two.</P>
 <P><IMG src="images/components1.gif" border=0 height=457 width=561 alt="images\components1.gif"> </P>
 <P class="Reference_Line" style="margin-bottom:0.00pt;">As mentioned above, you will need to discuss configuration details with your support representative including: </P>
 <P class="Reference_Line" style="margin-left:23.75pt;margin-bottom:0.00pt;">- Setting up a Server for TechAnywhere</P>
 <P class="Reference_Line" style="margin-left:23.75pt;margin-bottom:0.00pt;">- Supported Devices for TechAnywhere</P>
 <P class="Reference_Line" style="margin-left:23.75pt;margin-bottom:0.00pt;">- Setting Up Technician Devices for TechAnywhere</P>
 <P class="Reference_Line" style="margin-left:23.75pt;margin-bottom:0.00pt;text-indent:12.25pt;">XP</P>
 <P class="Reference_Line" style="margin-left:23.75pt;margin-bottom:0.00pt;text-indent:12.25pt;">Internet Explorer 6.0 or better</P>
 <P class="Reference_Line" style="margin-left:23.75pt;margin-bottom:0.00pt;text-indent:12.25pt;">Enable ‘Allow Active Control for Programs on My Computer’ under security</P>
 <P class="Reference_Line" style="margin-bottom:0.00pt;text-indent:12.25pt;">Purchasing any additional remote user licenses</P>
 <H2>Data and Functions Considerations</H2>
 <P class="Reference_Line" style="margin-bottom:0.00pt;">Your data must be set up correctly in order for TechAnywhere to function correctly.  A vgsrtry.cus file with TechAnywhere enabled and the number of user licenses specified must be in place in the directory containing your SAM Pro executable file (v.exe). </P>
 <H3>Payroll Period</H3>
 <P>If your Technicians will be recording labor hours via TechAnywhere, the Payroll Period that they record them to must </P>
 <P style="margin-left:23.75pt;">Be Active</P>
 <P style="margin-left:23.75pt;">Must have the Remote Technician Applet: Ok to Use box checked</P>
 <H3>Technician Record</H3>
 <P>On the Remote Access tab: </P>
 <P style="text-indent:18.00pt;">Web Access must be set to Technician</P>
 <P style="text-indent:18.00pt;">Remote Device Type set to either CE or XP</P>
 <P style="text-indent:18.00pt;">The TechAnywhere Prefix field must be completed (this will be used on PO’s generated from TechAnywhere) </P>
 <P style="text-indent:18.00pt;">The Technician record must point to a valid employee record, and there must be a one-to-one correspondence between the Technician record and the Employee record.</P>
 <H3>Document Viewer</H3>
 <P>Document Attachments (to work order, client or equipment records) must be flagged as Web Viewable Tech in order for your TechAnywhere users to see them. </P>
 <H3>Scheduled Event Manager</H3>
 <P>TechAnywhere requires that the Scheduled Event Manager be running.  The Scheduled Event manager will check for and process status changes and time sheet downloads from TechAnywhere. </P>
 <H3>Client Site Equipment</H3>
 <P>A default service job should be specified in all active Equipment records.</P>
 <H3>Escalation Profile</H3>
 <P>If one has not already been created, an Escalation Profile should be set up to alert the appropriate individuals that a web log has been created (as a result of the Technician entering a Recommendation in TechAnywhere).  We recommend an initial notification to the dispatcher, and a followup if the web log has not been attended to in an appropriate period of time.  Be sure to carefully review your business processes with your support representative when setting up this profile. The following illustration shows a typical example. </P>
 <P><IMG src="images/ta001.gif" border=0 height=555 width=845 alt="images\ta001.gif"> </P>
 <P>A registry entry (discussed in the following section) is required to attach the escalation profile to your web logs.</P>
 <H3>Registry Settings</H3>
 <P>The following registry entries should be created/checked prior to implementing TechAnywhere:</P>
 <P class="Tip_Note_Heading" style="margin-left:36.00pt;margin-top:4.00pt;">sys-email</P>
 <P style="margin-left:36.00pt;">If you will be running TechAnywhere in a test environment, we suggest using the RedirectAll= option to redirect all email to the individual in charge of the testing. This will avoid confusing regular personnel by sending them test date. </P>
 <P style="margin-left:36.00pt;"><FONT style="font-weight:bold; " >sys-weblog-escalation</FONT></P>
 <P style="margin-left:36.00pt;">This registry entry specifies which Escalation Profile will be attached to weblogs created from TechAnywhere. </P>
 <P class="Tip_Note_Heading" style="margin-left:36.00pt;margin-top:4.00pt;">sys-techanywhere</P>
 <P style="margin-left:36.00pt;">This entry is required to assign the applicable Job Cost Category to Inventory written to Work Orders from TechAnywhere. It may also be used to email the contents of the posting logs to the appropriate email address. &nbsp;</P>
 <P class="Tip_Note_Heading" style="margin-left:36.00pt;margin-top:4.00pt;">sys-web-access-technician</P>
 <P style="margin-left:36.00pt;">If you want your dispatch to control the release of work orders to your technicians’ wireless devices, the  NewWorkOrderStatus=Pending option may be used. When this option is implemented, all new wo’s will be created with a status of Pending. When the Release to Tech button (on the dispatch board or the work order Technician tab), the line’s status will be changed from Pending to the Default Status for the technician – when this is Unacknowledged, the dispatch will be eligible to be sent to the Technician’s device. </P>
 <H2>Process Overview</H2>
 <P class="Reference_Line" style="margin-left:29.50pt;margin-bottom:0.00pt;">1. When a TechAnywhere User first logs on and synchronizes his/her data, any unacknowledged work orders assigned to that user will appear in the Pending Work Order list.  </P>
 <P style="margin-left:47.50pt;">Purchase Orders associated with work orders assigned to TechAnywhere Techs will be uploaded to the TechAnywhere device if the PO exists when the WO is uploaded. These PO’s will display both inventory and misc. in TechAnywhere regardless of whether or not it has been received. This allows the technicians to see that those items that are already associated with the work order.  The PO number, quantities, part numbers and descriptions will be displayed in TechAnywhere.</P>
 <P class="Reference_Line" style="margin-bottom:0.00pt;text-indent:30.25pt;">2. In addition, the Tech may use the On Call Work Order function to create a new work order.  </P>
 <P class="Reference_Line" style="margin-bottom:0.00pt;">&nbsp;a. This will be sent as a Message to SAM Pro.</P>
 <P class="Reference_Line" style="margin-bottom:0.00pt;">&nbsp;b. When SAM Pro receives the Message, it will automatically generate a work order.</P>
 <P class="Reference_Line" style="margin-left:59.75pt;margin-bottom:0.00pt;">&nbsp;c. The next time the tech synchronizes, this new created work order will be uploaded to the wireless devices as a pended work order. </P>
 <P class="Reference_Line" style="margin-left:29.50pt;margin-bottom:0.00pt;">3. When the Tech acknowledges the work order (whether created in SAM Pro by the dispatcher, or as an On Call Work Order in TechAnywhere), a Message will be sent to SAM Pro. The Scheduled Event Manager will process this Message and change the status of the work order to waiting service in SAM Pro. </P>
 <P class="Reference_Line" style="margin-left:29.50pt;margin-bottom:0.00pt;">4. The Tech may change the status of the work order to Travel / Onsite / Waiting Parts as appropriate. These status changes will be delivered as Messages to SAM Pro; the Scheduled Event Manager will automatically pick them up and update the work order in SAM Pro. </P>
 <P class="Reference_Line" style="margin-left:29.50pt;margin-bottom:0.00pt;">5. The Tech may:</P>
 <P class="Reference_Line" style="margin-left:59.75pt;margin-bottom:0.00pt;">a. Add time, materials and inventory to the work order as needed. </P>
 <P class="Reference_Line" style="margin-left:59.75pt;margin-bottom:0.00pt;">b. Create Purchase Orders.</P>
 <P class="Reference_Line" style="margin-left:59.75pt;margin-bottom:0.00pt;">c. Capture customer signatures</P>
 <P class="Reference_Line" style="margin-left:59.75pt;margin-bottom:0.00pt;">d. Create Service Recommendations; that will be transformed into web logs. </P>
 <P class="Reference_Line" style="margin-left:59.75pt;margin-bottom:0.00pt;">e. Add additional existing equipment to the work order, or create new equipment.</P>
 <P class="Reference_Line" style="margin-left:29.50pt;margin-bottom:0.00pt;">6. The Tech may review and submit his time sheet if a pay ending is ending; this information will be sent as a message to SAM Pro and automatically processed by the Scheduled Event Manager as Labor Journal Entries.</P>
 <P class="Reference_Line" style="margin-left:29.50pt;margin-bottom:0.00pt;">7. When the Tech changes the status to ‘Completed’ and synchronizes, all detail lines (including previously unsent labor lines) and purchase orders will be downloaded to SAM Pro.</P>
