<h1>Employee Viewer Deductions Tab</h1>
<h2>Purpose:</h2>
<p>Create and maintain an employee&#39;s individualized Deductions information 
 that is used by the system when computing payroll. If the Deductions Group 
 Id is filled out in the main Employee record, the system will include 
 both the Group Deductions and those specified on this tab.</p>
<h2>Example:</h2>
<p>401(k), Vacation, Dues, garnishments, etc.</p>
<h2>Usage:</h2>
<p>This tab should be completed for each employee on your payroll, <font style="font-weight: bold; font-style: italic;">unless</font> they 
 are part of the Deductions Group specified in the main Employee record. 
 In this case, additional deductions not included in the Deduction Group 
 should be included on this tab.</p>
<p style="margin-left: 36.00pt;"><font style="font-weight: bold;">Worker’s 
 Comp Employee Portion:</font> If you are implementing 
 support for the employee portion of the Worker’s Comp 
 Expense in the Worker’s Comp Category record, 
 change the ending date to so that this deduction for Worker’s Comp will not be included as of the Payroll that includes 
 the addition of the Deduction Id to the Worker’s Comp category.</p>
<h2>Important Fields:</h2>
<p><font style="font-weight: bold;">Deduction Id:</font><br/>
Enter a valid Deduction Id (or double-click to select from your firm&#39;s 
 list of Deduction records).</p>
<p style="margin-left: 36.00pt;"><font style="font-weight: bold;" color="#0000FF">Tip:</font> 
 <font style="font-weight: bold;">Don&#39;t Overlap Dates with Same Deduction 
 Id</font><br/>
A specific Deduction Id should be used no more than once for the date range 
 defined by the Start and End Dates. <a data-target="POPUP530042842" data-rhwidget="DropSpot" href="#" class="dropspot"><span data-open-text="true" data-skip-index="true">Click

<p style="font-weight: bold;">Amount Type:<br/>
<span style="font-weight: normal;">This field specifies what the Amount 
 field represents. Double-click on this field to select from a list.</span> 
 </p>
<p style="margin-left: 48px; font-weight: normal;">fixed (fixed amount 
 in dollars)<br/>
hourly (hourly by hours worked in dollars)<br/>
hours paid (hourly by hours paid in dollars)<br/>

<p style="margin-left: 48px; font-weight: normal; font-style: normal;"><span style="font-weight: bold;">Important Notes on Garnishments:</span> 
 <br/>
Deductions for garnishments are typically entered as a percent of wages.</p>
<p style="margin-left: 48px;">Disposable 
 pay calculations for US and Canadian Payroll users where the garnishment 
 is a percentage of disposable pay are based on the settings of the Disposable 
 Income fields in the <a href="Deductions_Viewer.htm">Deductions</a> records. 
 </p>
<p><font style="font-weight: bold;">Amount:</font><br/>
The amount (per Amount Type): For example, 5.00 percent, $40 fixed, etc. 
 If this field is left blank, the amount (if any) will default from the 
 BASE Deduction record when the Compute Payroll process is run.  The 
 BASE Deduction Amount (if used) will trump any amounts entered here on 
 the employee.</p>
<p><font style="font-weight: bold;">Ded Limit Type:</font><br/>
If deductions of this type have no dollar limit, enter n/a (or double-click 
 on this field to select from a list). If deductions are capped by law 
 or company policy, select the appropriate time period for the Limit (amount, 
 pay period, monthly, annual, or quarterly). Please also see the Important 
 Note in the Limit field below.</p>
<p>The Limit Type of ‘amount’ should be used to handle loan repayments 
 and other miscellaneous deductions whose payback time frames span calendar 
 years (the previous Limit Types of pay period, monthly, annual, and quarterly 
 did not support this functionality). Typically, the Deduction Limit Type 
 of ‘amount’ would be used with an Amount Type of ‘percent’ with the Limit 
 set to the total amount of the loan.</p>
<p style="margin-left: 36.00pt;"><font style="text-decoration: underline; ">Example:</font></p>
<p style="margin-left: 36.00pt;">In this example, a loan of 5000 is to 
 be repaid at the rate of 5% per pay period. The following deduction could 
 be set up:</p>
<p style="margin-left: 88px;">Deduction Id: Loan<br/>
Ded Amount Type: percent<br/>
Amount: 5<br/>
Deduction Limit Type: amount<br/>
Limit: 5000</p>
<p style="margin-left: 36.00pt;">In this example, care must be taken to 
 set the End Date far enough into the future that the loan can be repaid. 
 When the Limit is reached (or the End Date is past), this Deduction will 
 no longer be taken.</p>
<p style="margin-left: 8px;"><font style="font-weight: bold;">Disposable 
 Limit: (click Magnify button to see field)<br/>
</font>The maximum percentage of disposable income that may be garnished. 
 This limit varies according to the type of garnishment being applied. 
 <span style="font-weight: bold;">Note: if this field is blank for a garnishment 
 deduction, payroll taxes will NOT be deducted before the garnishment is 
 assessed. We recommend setting this field to 99 unless a specific percentage 
 is required.</span> Click <a href="#Disposable_Limit:">Disposable Limit 
 Details</a> for additional information.</p>
<p><font style="font-weight: bold;">Limit:</font><br/>
The dollar limit (if any) for deductions of this type. The system validates 
 &amp; enforces that the Limit Value must be 0 when the Ded. Limit Type 
 = &quot;n/a&quot;.  </p>
<p style="margin-left: 36.00pt;"><font style="font-weight: bold;">IMPORTANT 
 NOTE:</font> If the Employee&#39;s Deduction limit is 0, compute payroll uses 
 the Deduction Limit and Deduction Limit Type from the BASE Deduction record. 
  This being the case, then when setting the Deduction Limit Types 
 (n/a, annual, pay period, etc) in the BASE Deduction, the BASE Deduction 
 should contain the UNIVERSAL RULE that apply to ALL employees,  if 
 the deduction limit type varies by employee, then set the Deduction Limit 
 Type to &quot;N/A&quot; in the BASE Deduction.</p>
<p><font style="font-weight: bold;">Start Date: End Date:</font> (date 
 format mmddyyyy)<br/>
The time period (pertaining to the Effective Dates of labor hours entered, 
 not the Payroll Check date) this amount is valid (e.g., fiscal year, contract 
 period, etc.) A Deductions Id may appear more than once in a table if 
 the date ranges do not overlap. Use the End Date to stop a deduction or 
 use an S in Cycle to skip the deduction(s).</p>
<p style="margin-left: 36.00pt;"><font style="font-weight: bold;" color="#0000FF">Tip:</font> 
 <font style="font-weight: bold;">Handling Deduction Changes</font><br/>
If this employee&#39;s deductions change, you would add a new Deduction line 
 (or lines) with a Start Date corresponding to the first working day at 
 the new deduction amount. The End Date of the old Deduction line (at the 
 previous rate or amount) should be the last day worked at that rate and 
 should correspond to the end of a Payroll Period.</p>
<p><font style="font-weight: bold;">C:</font> (1 character)<br/>
Describes the deduction Cycle: m (monthly) p (pay period) a (annual) q 
 (quarterly) etc. The deduction Cycle(s) are entered when running the Compute 
 Payroll process to know when a deduction should be taken or skipped.  To 
 skip a deduction cycle, the Compute Payroll is run without that cycle 
 code.  For example, a cycle code of S can be used to skip the 
 deduction by NEVER entering it in Compute Payroll. <span style="font-size: 11.0pt;

<h3><a name="Employee_Miscellaneous_Deductions_Checks" id="Employee_Miscellaneous_Deductions_Checks"></a>Employee 
 Miscellaneous Deductions Checks</h3>
<p>The following fields enable check printing/processing capabilities for 
 Employee PR Miscellaneous Deductions. This functionality is particularly 
 useful for various types of garnishments (for child support payments, 
 for example), as well as for deductions such as United Way.</p>
<p>Checks for Employee PR Deductions are printed using the Report PR Miscellaneous 
 Deductions Check / Report PR Miscellaneous Deductions Check Detail functions. 
 Note that these reports must be run <font style="font-weight: bold;">after</font> 
 your regular payroll checks have been printed and posted. EFT / AFT processing 
 is <span style="font-weight: bold;">NOT</span> supported for Vendors paid 
 by <span style="font-weight: bold;">PRMD</span> (Payroll Miscellaneous 
 Deduction) Checks. </p>

 to see the pertinent fields.</p>
<p><font style="font-weight: bold;">Vendor Id:<br/>
</font>Enter the Vendor that the check generated from this deduction should 
 be sent to. For example, in the case of a garnishment the Vendor might 
 be a court. </p>
<p><font style="font-weight: bold;">Remit Description:<br/>
</font>The Description that should appear on the check that is generated 
 when the Report PR Miscellaneous Deductions Check / Report PR Miscellaneous 
 Deductions Check Detail functions are run. For a garnishment, this might 
 reference the court order number.</p>
<p class="Reference_Line" style="margin-bottom: 0.00pt;"><font style="font-weight: bold;">Remit 
 Type:<br/>
</font>This field determines whether or not multiple deductions will be 
 will be combined then the checks are generated.</p>
<p class="Reference_Line" style="margin-left: 36.00pt; margin-bottom: 0.00pt;"><font style="font-weight: bold;">By Deduction:</font> one check per deduction</p>
<p class="Reference_Line" style="margin-left: 36.00pt; margin-bottom: 0.00pt;"><font style="font-weight: bold;">By Employee:</font> if multiple deductions 
 exist for the same Employee / Vendor combination, one check for this Employee 
 will be generated for the Vendor.</p>
<p class="Reference_Line" style="margin-left: 36.00pt; margin-bottom: 0.00pt;"><font style="font-weight: bold;">By Vendor:</font> this option might be 
 selected it the case of a charitable deduction. In this case, deductions 
 for multiple employees would be combined on the same check.</p>
<p><font style="font-weight: bold;">Amount Type: and Amount<br/>
</font>Deductions for garnishments are entered as a percent of wages (Amount 
 Type = percent) but are calculated based on disposable income (less taxes).</p>
<p style="margin-left: 48px;"><font style="font-weight: bold;">Important 
 Note:</font> the Deduction Amount Type of ‘Standard’ is reserved for future 
 use, and should NOT be selected.</p>
<p><font style="font-weight: bold;"><a name="Disposable_Limit:" id="Disposable_Limit:">Disposable 
 Limit:</a><br/>
</font>The maximum percentage of disposable income that may be garnished. 
 This limit varies according to the type of garnishment being applied. 
 <span style="font-weight: bold;">Note: if this field is blank for a garnishment 
 deduction, payroll taxes will NOT be deducted before the garnishment is 
 assessed. We recommend setting this field to 99 unless a specific percentage 
 is required. </span>Thus, if three garnishments of 10% each are applied, 
 and the maximum percentage that may be garnished in this case is 25%, 
 one of the deductions will be ‘clipped’ to 5%. Note that both the Disposable 
 Limit and the Limit (see above) will be observed.</p>
<p style="margin-left: 36.00pt;"><font style="text-decoration: underline; ">Example:<br/>
</font>Assume a judgment is issued that says 10% of disposable income should 
 be garnished from each pay with an annual limit of $2,500. This case, 
 Limit would be set to $2,500, Deduction Limit Type to percent, Amount 
 to 10.0, and Disposable Limit to 10. If an employee has $1,000 of disposable 
 income per week would generate a $100 deduction per week.  After 
 25 weeks, the full annual amount of $2,500 has been deducted. Since 
 the system looks at both the Limit and the Disposable Limit when Compute 
 is run, the garnishment would not be taken in the 26<font style="vertical-align: super;">th</font> 
 week.</p>
<p>In addition, the system now validates &amp; enforces that the Limit 
 Value must be 0, when Limit Amount Type = &quot;n/a&quot;.</p>
<p class="Reference_Line" style="margin-bottom: 0.00pt;"><font style="font-weight: bold;">Priority:<br/>
</font>This field determines the order in which deductions will be processed 
 if the Disposable Limit is reached. Suppose that three garnishments of 
 10% each are in effect: one which a priority of 1, the next 2, and the 
 third 3. If the maximum percentage that may be garnished in this case 
 is 25%, the deduction with priority 3 will be ‘clipped’ to 5%.</p>
