<h1>Payroll Check Report</h1>
<h2>Purpose:</h2>
<p>This report produces the Payroll Checks used to pay your employees. 
 Direct Deposit Advice will also appear on this report for employees set 
 up for Direct Deposit rather than live paycheck. A voided check stub displaying 
 the first three direct deposit accounts will be produced, and a check 
 number will be used. Note that if more than three active direct deposit 
 accounts are specified in the Employee DDEP tab, the third line of direct 
 deposit will summarize the remaining account information.</p>
<p>Paid time off (by pay time) will also be printed on the pay stub.</p>
<p>This function excludes employees whose Security Id does not match the 
 Security Id of the user running Report PR Checks.</p>
<p><font style="font-weight: bold;">PR Checks</font> <font style="font-weight: bold;">in 
 a Multi-User Environment</font><font style="font-weight: bold;">:</font><br/>
The system prevents users from doing multiple simultaneous check runs for 
 the same GL / Entity combination. Compute Payroll ignores employees with 
 in-use PR data (if a PR Check is being run for that Employee, they will 
 be skipped by Compute PR).</p>
<p><font style="font-weight: bold;">Direct Deposit Payroll checks:</font> 
 Only the last four digits of the employee’s bank account number (used 
 for direct deposit) will now be printed on the PR check stub; the other 
 digits will be replaced by *s. </p>

<h2>Usage:</h2>
<p>After you complete the fields and click the Go button, the system will 
 ask you to confirm that the checks printed correctly. After you click 
 Yes, the system will then display the Check Print Checklist. At this point, 
 you can decide whether to post the transaction, void the transaction, 
 or reuse the check.</p>
<p>Validation prevents the user from closing the Payroll Check Checklist 
 (which appears after the user has confirmed the print) by clicking the 
 Windows Red X, abandoning the check run. If the user clicks the Red X, 
 he will be informed that &quot;This process cannot be canceled.&quot; 
  After clearing the message box by clicking Ok, the user must then 
 choose to Post, Reuse or Void the checks, and then click Go.</p>
<p>When Payroll is posted to the General Ledger (after printing payroll 
 checks) employee names and id&#39;s will not be included in the transaction 
 detail. This preserves employee confidentiality on GL reports.</p>
<p>After the Direct Deposit Advice has successfully been printed, the <a href="Report_EFT.htm">Report EFT (Generate EFT Register)</a> function 
 should be run to produce your ACH file.</p>

 Payroll Checks</a> for details.</p>
<h2>Registry Entries:</h2>
<p><a href="Registry_Entry_Payroll_Check.htm">Registry Entry Payroll Check</a></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: bold;">Modify 
 Employee PIN:</span> See the <a href="Registry_Employee_PDF_PIN.htm">Registry 
 Employee PDF PIN</a> for a setting to generate the PIN differently using 
 information in the Employee record. </p>
<h2>Report Description:</h2>
<p>PR Checks will be printed on an 8.5&quot; x 11&quot; form with dual 
 stubs at the top and bottom. Wage detail will appear on the stubs.</p>
<p>Fringes will also be printed on the stubs if an <a href="Earnings_Viewer.htm">Earnings</a> 
 record is marked as Fringe, and the Fringe on Check box is checked. Typically, 
 this option is used in conjunction with union payroll packages to verify 
 to the employee that the fringes specified in their contracts are being 
 accounted for.</p>
<p>Reimbursables (if applicable) will be listed in the Recap section of 
 the stub.</p>
<p>The Payroll Period Start and End dates, and the Check Date, also appear 
 on the Recap portion of the Payroll Check stubs.</p>
<p class="Body_Text">The check label &quot;Various&quot; will be used when 
 the number and type of Pay Types on the check stub exceed the available 
 space.</p>
<p class="Body_Text" style="margin-left: 36.00pt;"><font style="font-weight: bold; 
														 text-decoration: underline; ">Example:<br/>
</font> If for a particular payroll run an employee has the following PTO 
 types (Holiday, Vacation, Sick, Personal). The results on the check stub 
 for labels may be something like Holiday, Vacation, Various. This is also 
 true for other pay types and deductions as well.</p>
<h2>Important Fields:</h2>
<p><font style="font-weight: bold;">Report Options:</font><br/>
The Report Options selector pane controls how the report will be output. 
 Click <a href="Report_Options.htm">Report Options</a> to learn more.</p>
<p><font style="font-weight: bold; font-style: italic;">Verify that your 
 check stock is loaded in the printer and that the correct printer is selected 
 before proceeding.</font></p>
<p><font style="font-weight: bold;">Payroll Period Id:</font><br/>
Required. Enter a valid Payroll Period Id or double-click on this field 
 to select from a list. The Start and End Check Date display-only fields 
 will be filled in when this Id is entered.</p>
<p><font style="font-weight: bold;">GL Entity Id:</font><br/>
If your company departmentalizes or uses profit centers for paychecks, 
 enter the appropriate GL Entity to be credited or double-click on this 
 field to select from a list of Id&#39;s. Note that the system uses the combination 
 of GL Entity and GL Account Number when determining the check number sequences; 
 a specific GL Account might have checks 1,2 and 3 for GL Entity 1, checks 
 1,2,3 and 4 for GL Entity 2, and so on. Therefore, depending upon how 
 your company data is set up, you would most likely <font style="font-weight: bold;">always</font> 
 specify a GL Entity, or <font style="font-weight: bold;">never</font> 
 specify a GL Entity.</p>
<p><font style="font-weight: bold;">GL Account Id:</font><br/>
(Required.) The bank (cash) account on which payroll checks are drawn. 
 Double-click on this field to select from a list of Id&#39;s. When you enter 
 the GL Entity (if used) and GL Account Id&#39;s, the system will automatically 
 default the next sequential check number (the last number that you used 
 for this GL Account/Entity combination plus 1).</p>
<p><font style="font-weight: bold;">Check Date</font><br/>
(Required.) The date as it will appear on the check(s). Press the Spacebar 
 to enter today&#39;s date, or double-click to display the calendar viewer. 
 Note that this date must fall within the range specified by the display 
 only Start and End Check Date fields.</p>
<p><font style="font-weight: bold;">Check Number:</font><br/>
The number of the first check to be printed for this range. If you have 
 run checks for this GL Entity/GL Account combination before, the check 
 number will default to the last sequentially used number plus 1. The user 
 may change the Check Number if needed. However, if a gap exists between 
 the last check printed for this GL Account Id/GL Entity and the Check 
 Number that you fill in (e.g., you fill in 150, and the last check printed 
 was 144), the system will alert you that no checks may be issued in the 
 future for numbers within the gap (e.g., 145-149) in addition to the checks 
 that you actually print. Similarly, the system will alert you if the check 
 number that you entered has already been used.</p>
<p><font style="font-weight: bold;">Employee Id</font>:<br/>
To print a check for a specific Employee, enter the Id. Several Employees 
 may be listed by entering their Id&#39;s separated by commas (1028,1376,2645).</p>
<p><font style="font-weight: bold;">Branch Id:</font><br/>
If you enter a Branch Id in this range field (or double-click on this range 
 to select from a list of branches), only Payroll checks for this Branch 
 will be include in the check run.</p>
<p>This report supports the Hard Block 
 logic (implemented by the BranchFilterWithHardBlock global settings registry 
 option) in this version.  The Hard Block is maintained regardless 
 of how the Branch filter range is set.</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: bold;">All 
 Checks - Physical Checks - EFT Checks<br/>
</span>This field may be used to separate EFT and Physical Checks. The 
 All Checks option prints both Physical and EFT checks.  Select Physical 
 Checks to only print live checks, or  EFT Checks to limit the run 
 to EFT&#39;s. </p>
<p><font style="font-weight: bold;">Executive Payroll</font>:<br/>
If you are an Executive Payroll user, this field will default to Y; to 
 print checks for all employees (Executive or not) clear this range.</p>
<p>If your user record is not flagged as Executive Payroll, you will only 
 be able to print checks for other non-Executive users.</p>
