<h1>Compute Job Invoice</h1>
<p>The Compute Job Invoice function offers the most efficient method of 
 computing Job Invoices for non-service compute work orders and PMâ€™s that 
 are not billed from the Client Site Billing schedule.</p>
<p style="margin-left: 48px;"><font style="font-weight: bold;">COD Functionality:</font><br/>
This feature is designed for Service users with residential customers. 
 Typically, payment is calculated with preprinted forms and collected from 
 certain residential clients by the technician when the work is done. The 
 status of COD Invoices can be set directly to Ok to Post, and the Cash 
 Receipt automatically recorded. Note that Labor, Material, and Other charges 
 must have been recorded on the Work Order.</p>
<p><font style="font-weight: bold;">1.</font> Go to the Invoicing tab of 
 the Folders viewer (Accounting Topic) and click the Compute Job Invoice 
 function.</p>
<p><font style="font-weight: bold;">2.</font> When the Batch Invoices screen 
 appears, fill in the following:</p>
<p>__ Invoice Date: the date that you wish to appear on the Invoice<br/>
__ End Date (charges with effective dates after the End Date will not be 
 included on the Invoice)<br/>
__ Invoice Status for COD Jobs: Ok to Print Ok to Post<br/>
By default, OK to Print is selected. This option should be selected if 
 you want to produce hard copy invoices for your COD Jobs. Select OK to 
 Post if you do not want to print your COD invoices. In this case, the 
 status of COD Invoices will be set directly to Ok to Post; they will be 
 included with your non-COD Invoices when you run the post.</p>
<p>__ GL Bank Account Id: the GL Bank Account Id that specifies where the 
 COD funds were deposited.<br/>
__ Job Id (leave blank to compute for all jobs)<br/>
__ Billing Cycle (note that leaving this field blank computes invoices 
 only for jobs whose Billing Cycle field is blank)</p>
<p><font style="font-weight: bold;">3.</font> Click the Go button.</p>
<p><font style="font-weight: bold;">4.</font> A checklist of jobs will 
 appear: you may select which are to be computed and then click the Go 
 button on this screen. At this point, you will also enter the check number 
 (or the word Cash) for those COD invoices for which you have already received 
 payment.</p>
<p>__ Invoice Id: if this field is blank, it will automatically be assigned 
 the next number by the system. If you are using preprinted forms to invoice 
 your COD customers, you may enter the appropriate reference number.</p>
<p>__ Check Number: this field must be completed for COD processing. If 
 the customer paid by check, enter the check number. If the customer paid 
 by cash, enter the word cash.</p>
<p>When you click the Go button, the status of your COD Invoices will be 
 set to OK to Print or OK to Post, depending upon which option you selected 
 in the previous screen. The system will make a cash receipt entry to the 
 specified GL Bank Account Id for all selected COD invoices when they are 
 posted.</p>
<p>After running the Compute function, you should print the Billing Worksheet, 
 make any Billing Adjustments needed, and then Print and Post the Invoices 
 (as discussed in <a href="Job_Invoice_Overview.htm">Job Invoice Overview</a>. 
 )</p>
