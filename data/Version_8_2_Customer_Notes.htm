<p>Click to go to <a href="#8.2_Recent_Updates">8.2_Recent_Updates</a>.</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: bold;">Current 8.2 Users:</span> The system allows multiple lines on the Work Order Technician tab with the same Tech Id and Date but a different Time Scheduled (compatible with TechAnywhere 3.0.048.006+). If a TechAnywhere Tech must be sent back to work on a Work Order later in the day, a new line for the Tech (with the same date, but a unique time) would be added to the Work Order. A change to the Work Order indices is required for current 8.2 installations; contact support to arrange for this change.</p>
<p style="font-weight: bold;">AP Journal (Important Note on the Main Tab - GL Entity field):<br />
<span style="font-weight: normal;">This field also sets the GL Entity for manual checks, EFT and CC/DR Card transactions when posting to a Bank Account. Previously, it just assigned an Entity to the AP Control Account and Discounts Earned. Because of this change:</span></p>
<p style="margin-left: 48px;">If InterCompany IS enabled, set to a Corporate GL Entity for the company.</p>
<p style="margin-left: 48px;">If InterCompany is NOT enabled, this field should be BLANK for manual checks, EFT and CC transactions to avoid Bank Reconciliation issues. &#160;</p>

<h1>1 System</h1>
<h2>1.1 Intercompany Processing</h2>
<h3>1.1.1 Overview</h3>
<p>This enhancement supports Intercompany Processing at the GL level via automated ‘Due To’ and ‘Due From’ transactions any time costs or revenues are incurred/earned by one company on behalf of another company. Anytime the system sees a difference between the company that a balance sheet GL Entity belongs to and the company that the Income Statement GL Entity belongs to, the automated 'Due To' and 'Due From' transactions will be made.</p>
<p>For example, if monies are received in the AR Cash Receipts by Company A for work billed by Company B, the system would make the usual debit to the AR account and credit to the bank account. In addition, the Due From account in Company A would be debited, and the Due To account in Company B would be credited: this processing keeps the balance sheet accounts in balance.</p>
<p>Alternately if monies are received in the AR Cash Receipts by Company A for work billed by Company A, the system would only make the usual debit to the AR account and credit to the bank account: the automated intercompany transactions would not be needed.</p>
<p>Currently, Intercompany Processing does NOT support one company’s ‘profiting’ from work performed for another company. All restitutions are made via the Bank Transfer function.</p>
<h3>1.1.2 Setup</h3>
<p>Ideally, Intercompany Processing would be implemented when first starting to use SAMPro. If there is any possibility of a new company being acquired in the future, new ‘one company’ firms can be set up for Intercompany Processing; if and when a new company is acquired, it can be more easily integrated into the database.</p>
<p>Firms currently running SAMPro without Intercompany Processing should consult their support representative if they are thinking about implementing this functionality: a significant amount of work will be required to convert an existing system.</p>
<p>The existing GL Entity and Security records and the new Company record are at the heart of Intercompany Processing.</p>
<p><font style="font-weight: bold;">GL Entity:</font> Each GL Entity must specify a specific Company.&#160;&#160;In addition to the GL Entities designated for the various profit centers within a company, a ‘balance sheet’ Entity will be created for use with Intercompany postings.</p>
<p><font style="font-weight: bold;">GL Account:</font> A ‘Due To’ Asset account and a ‘Due From’ Liability account should be created for each company. A good technique for the Due To and Due From GL accounts is to create a root account with the company extension (i.e. DUE TO 1200-A for company A and 1200-B for company B …)</p>
<p><font style="font-weight: bold;">Security:</font> A Security record must be created for each Company</p>
<p><font style="font-weight: bold;">Company:</font> The Company record defines the Security Id, GL Entity (for balance sheet transactions), and Due To and Due From GL Accounts.</p>
<h3>1.1.3 New Record: Company</h3>
<p style="font-weight: bold;">Purpose:</p>
<p>This record is required for Intercompany Processing. The Company record defines the Security Id, GL Entity (for balance sheet transactions), and Due To and Due From GL Accounts.</p>
<p style="font-weight: bold;">Important Fields: Upper Section</p>
<p style="font-weight: bold;">Main Tab:</p>
<p style="margin-left: 36.00pt;"><font style="font-weight: bold;">Company Id:<br /></font>Uniquely identifies this company. It is recommended that the Company Id and Security Id match.</p>
<p style="margin-left: 36.00pt;"><font style="font-weight: bold;">Company Name:<br /></font> The Name of the Company. If a report is run for a selected company, the company name on the report will default from this field. If a report is run for all companies, the company name on the report will default from the companyname registry entry.</p>
<p style="margin-left: 36.00pt;"><font style="font-weight: bold;">Security Id:<br /></font>This required field specifies the Security applied to transactions for this company.</p>
<p style="margin-left: 36.00pt;"><font style="font-weight: bold;">Federal EIN:<br /></font>The Federal EIN for this Company. This field is reserved for future use with reporting.</p>
<p style="font-weight: bold;">GL Tab:</p>
<p style="margin-left: 36.00pt;"><font style="font-weight: bold;">Balance Sheet Default: GL Entity Id:<br /></font>The GL Entity to be applied only to Intercompany transactions. This GL Entity should NOT represent a profit center.</p>
<p style="margin-left: 36.00pt;"><font style="font-weight: bold;">Intercompany DUE FROM this Company: GL Account Id:<br /></font>The Asset account to be debited in Intercompany transactions.</p>

<p style="font-weight: bold;">User Fields Tab:</p>
<p style="margin-left: 36.00pt;"><font style="font-weight: bold;">Company User 1-5:<br /></font>These optional fields enable you to retain additional information about this Company.</p>
<p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">&#160;</p>
<p style="font-weight: bold;">Important Fields: Lower Section</p>
<p style="font-weight: bold;">Registry Tab:</p>
<p style="margin-left: 36.00pt;"><font style="font-weight: bold;">Key:</font> <font style="font-weight: bold;">Value:</font> <font style="font-weight: bold;">Description</font>:</p>
<p style="margin-left: 36.00pt;">These fields are reserved for future use.</p>
<p style="font-weight: bold;">States Tab:</p>
<p style="margin-left: 36.00pt; font-weight: bold;">ST:</p>
<p style="margin-left: 36.00pt;">This tab should be used to define the State/States associated with this Company.</p>
<p style="margin-left: 36.00pt; font-weight: bold;">State EIN:</p>
<p style="margin-left: 36.00pt;">This field is reserved for future use with reporting.</p>
<p style="font-weight: bold;">Entities Tab:</p>
<p>This tab displays the Balance Sheet and Profit Center Entities that point at this Company record.</p>
<p class="Support" style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">&#160;</p>
<h3>1.1.4 Records/Functions Changed to Support Company Processing</h3>
<p style="font-weight: bold;">GL Entity:</p>
<p style="margin-left: 36.00pt;">In addition to the GL Entities defined for profit centers, if Intercompany Processing is implemented, a GL Entity should be defined for use in Due To / Due From transactions. This type of Entity will be referenced on the Company record’s GL Tab in the Balance Sheet Default GL Entity field.</p>
<p style="margin-left: 36.00pt;"><font style="font-weight: bold;">New Field: Company Id</font><br />
This field must be completed if Intercompany Processing is implemented (the sys-ffv-global-settings registry’s IntercompanyEnabled option is set to true).</p>
<p style="font-weight: bold;">GL Account:</p>
<p style="margin-left: 36.00pt;">If Intercompany Processing is implemented a Due To Asset account and a Due From Liability account should be created for each Company record. A good technique for the Due To and Due From GL accounts is to create a root account with the company extension (i.e. DUE TO 1200-A for company A and 1200-B for company B …).</p>
<p style="font-weight: bold;">AP Journal Main Tab:</p>
<p style="margin-left: 36.00pt;"><font style="font-weight: bold;">Changed Field: GL Entity:<br /></font>If Intercompany Processing is implemented and if this Entity does not match the GL Entities referenced in the child tabs, the appropriate Intercompany postings to GL History will be made when this transaction is saved.</p>
<p><font style="font-weight: bold;">AR Cash Receipts</font> <font style="font-weight: bold;">Main Tab:</font></p>
<p style="margin-left: 36.00pt;"><font style="font-weight: bold;">Changed Field: GL Entity:</font><br />
If Intercompany Processing is implemented (the sys-ffv-global-settings registry’s IntercompanyEnabled option is set to true) and if this Entity does not match the GL Entities referenced in the child tabs, the appropriate Intercompany postings to GL History will be made when this transaction is saved.</p>
<p style="margin-left: 36.00pt;">Entries now post the correct Security to AR and Job History when Intercompany Processing is enabled.</p>
<p style="font-weight: bold;">Job Record:</p>
<p style="margin-left: 36.00pt;"><font style="font-weight: bold;">Changed Field: Job GL Entity Id<br /></font>When Intercompany Processing is enabled, the GL Entities specified in the Job record MUST reference the same Company as the GL Entities specified in its Cost Codes. Validation will not allow the GL Entity to be changed to one referencing a different Company.</p>
<p style="font-weight: bold;">Job Cost Code Record:</p>
<p style="margin-left: 36.00pt;"><font style="font-weight: bold;">Changed Field: GL Entity Id<br /></font>When Intercompany Processing is enabled, the GL Entities specified in the Job record MUST reference the same Company as the GL Entities specified in its Cost Codes. Validation will not allow the GL Entity to be changed to one referencing a different Company.</p>
<p><font style="font-weight: bold;">Location:</font> complete the GL Entity field; it is required for Intercompany Processing.</p>
<p style="font-weight: bold;">Purchase Order Record:</p>
<p style="margin-left: 36.00pt;"><font style="font-weight: bold;">Status Tab -</font> <font style="font-weight: bold;">New Field: GL Entity Id<br /></font>This field defaults from the Location record. It is required if Intercompany Processing is enabled.</p>
<p><font style="font-weight: bold;">New Call</font> <font style="font-weight: bold;">and Create PM Work Orders:</font></p>
<p style="margin-left: 36.00pt;">When Intercompany Processing is enabled, the Job GL Entity specified in the selected Job will determine the Work Order’s Company/Security.</p>
<p style="font-weight: bold;">Compute PR:</p>
<p style="margin-left: 36.00pt;">When Intercompany Processing is enabled, the GL Entity specified in the Employee record provided the override for the Company/Security of the post.</p>
<p style="font-weight: bold;">Bank Transfer Journal:</p>
<p style="margin-left: 36.00pt;">When Intercompany Processing is enabled, the Bank Entity is required: it decides which Company/Service the transfer belongs to. The Transfer From Entity is also required for Intercompany Processing.</p>
<p><font style="font-weight: bold;">Bank</font> <font style="font-weight: bold;">Deposit</font> <font style="font-weight: bold;">Journal:</font></p>
<p style="margin-left: 36.00pt;">When Intercompany Processing is enabled, the Bank and Sweep Entities are both required. The Bank Entity controls what Company/Security the deposit is applied to. The Sweep Entity defines the Company/Security the deposit is from. If the Bank and Sweep Entities are different, an automatic Intercompany Processing GL transaction will be generated.</p>
<p style="font-weight: bold;">Bank Reconciliation Journal:</p>
<p style="margin-left: 48px;">1. GL Entity Ids are required for Interco customizations.<br />
2. All entities must reference the same Company when intercompany is ON.<br />
3. The system posts Company Security Rn to GLH Security Rn when intercompany is ON.</p>
<p style="font-weight: bold;">Record Billing Adjustments/ Progress Billing:</p>
<p style="margin-left: 36.00pt;">When intercompany processing is enabled, the Company/Security is now correctly set for the AR Sales Journal and resulting history records when Progress Invoices are posted.</p>
<p style="margin-left: 36.00pt;">The A/R Control GL Entity is now displayed on the Progress Billing Post Report. Although the GL Entities for the Sale Tax entries do not appear on this report, they are written to history correctly.</p>
<p style="font-weight: bold;">Job Cost EOM Processing:</p>
<p style="margin-left: 36.00pt;">When intercompany processing is enabled, the Company/Security is recorded in General Ledger History when this function is run.</p>
<p style="font-weight: bold;">Voiding Checks:</p>
<p style="margin-left: 36.00pt;">When intercompany processing is enabled, the Company/Security is set in history when running this functionality.</p>
<p style="margin-left: 8px; font-weight: bold;">Inventory Adjustment Journal:</p>
<p style="margin-left: 48px;">The system now validates that the GL Entity not blank when intercompany is enabled. When an Inventory Adjustment is created, the system generates Intercompany GLH when appropriate.&#160;&#160;This does NOT apply to Adjustment-type entries.&#160;&#160;No Intercompany GLH is generated when From/To entities belong to the same company.</p>
<p style="margin-left: 48px;">The full screen view now shows To/From Company Ids.</p>
<p style="margin-left: 8px; font-weight: bold;">Start Fill Backorders: &#160;<span style="font-weight: normal;">(for Materials Requisitioning)</span></p>
<p style="margin-left: 8px; font-weight: bold;">Start Generate Purchase Orders: &#160;<span style="font-weight: normal;">(PO header now includes GL Entity from Location).</span></p>
<p style="margin-left: 8px;">R<span style="font-weight: bold;">eport PR Checks:</span> When intercompany is enabled, the Security Id is set in the Check record when Checks are posted or voided.</p>
<p style="margin-left: 8px;"><span style="font-weight: bold;">Report PR Misc Deductions Checks:</span> When intercompany is enabled, the Security Id is set in the Check record when Checks are posted or voided.</p>
<h3>1.1.5 History Tables Changed to Support Intercompany Processing</h3>
<p>An Intercompany? field has been added to the following History tables: it will be checked if the transaction records an intercompany transaction: AP GL History (apglhstry_intrcmpny), AR GL History (arglhstry_intrcmpny) and GL History (glhstry_intrcmpny).</p>
<p>The Company/Security field (cmpny_sscrty_rn) has been added to: AP History, AP GL History, AR History, AR GL History, GL History, IM History, JC History, PR History, Sales Commission History, Tax History.</p>
<p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">&#160;</p>
<h3>1.1.6 Intercompany Reporting</h3>
<p>To support Intercompany Processing, the bitmap path is now saved in the dbr file itself, so that the registry is not required to display the desired bitmap when the report is redisplayed. If the saved report is from an earlier release where the bitmap path was not saved, the applicable registry entry will be used. This functionality has been expanded to the code SAMPro uses to generate the XML file used by the xmltopdf.jar file so that .PDF’s are also generated correctly.</p>
<p>Functionality has been added to all reporting functions to support Company-based security.</p>
<p style="font-weight: bold;">Report Range Viewer: New Select Company Pane</p>
<p>The new Select Company pane (located in the upper part of the screen between the Preview/Print/Schedule pane and the Report Ranges pane) will list the Company records defined in your database. To run the report the report for a specific company, click on a line to select it. To run the report for all Companies, do NOT select a Company: all will be shown.</p>
<p>If the report is run for all companies, the company name on the report will default from the companyname registry entry. If the report is run for a selected company, the company name on the report will default from the Company record’s Company Name field.</p>
<p style="font-weight: bold;">Start Compute Service Invoice</p>
<p><font style="font-weight: bold;">New Field: Company Id:<br /></font>If Intercompany Processing is enabled, this field is required to run Service Invoices. The Service Invoices generated will use the bitmaps specified by the sys-report-serviceinvoice-securityid registry unless overridden by a user-specific registry.</p>
<p>The system now uses the registry setting with security (if applicable) to determine the directory to use when saving the attachment. The security settings are also retained when saving the dbr report so that when it is displayed later the correct bitmaps will appear.</p>
<h2>1.2 Book Viewer</h2>
<p>Invoices for two or more Clients may be generated from one work order (e.g., Warranty / Non-Warranty). Previously, when invoices were auto-filled for one of the Clients, invoices for the other Client (referencing the same WO) also appeared. &#160;In this release, only invoices for the Client specified in the Book record are auto-filled.</p>
<p>Invoices/associated documents are now correctly filtered based on the Date Range.</p>
<h3>1.2.1 Registry To Display Files as they Generate (restores previous behavior)</h3>
<p>In previous releases, when .PDF files were created from the Book viewer, they were immediately displayed, along with a document log workspace. Since this could generate an alarming number of windows, the default is to NOT display the .PDF or Workspace files.</p>
<p>If you would prefer that the .PDF files be displayed as they are generated, the following registry is required.</p>
<p><font style="font-weight: bold;">Id:</font> sys-viewer-vbk</p>
<p><font style="font-weight: bold;">Setting Key:</font> ShowMakePDFInfo Setting Value: true&#160;&#160;(default is false)</p>
<h3>1.2.2 Make PDF Enhancements</h3>
<p>When you run Make PDF from a Book record where a PDF has already been made, you are given the option to clear the previous documents to prevent duplicates: if you use the Make PDF button multiple times, you will end up with multiple copies of the PDF books when you e-mail from the Book viewer; this has to do with multiple instances of Document files being generated.</p>
<p>Email PDF has been fixed to use Chapter titles as Attachment names even if only the Archive document can be found. This will allow the Movement of book folders from SAMPro Base Directory to the normal PDF directory in registry sys-viewer-vbk PDFDirectory.<br /></p>
<p>If the Book is by Invoice, Make PDF now names chapters 'Inv#',chapter,'[',BookId,']'.pdf<br />
where chapter is an invoice number.</p>
<p>If the Book is by Site, Make PDF now names chapters 'Site',chapter,'[',BookId,']'.pdf<br />
where chapter is a Site Id.</p>
<p>A progress Meter has been added to Make PDF to see how it is progressing; this will only appear if more than one PDF file is being generated.</p>
<p>A confirmation has been added if Make PDF is pressed after Make PDF has been run; the message ‘Directory holding Chapters for this Book already exists. Are you sure you want to run this function again?’</p>
<p>Make PDF will put chapters in the book directory from registry as follows:</p>
<p style="margin-left: 36.00pt;">PDFDirectory from registry sys-viewer-vbk or<br />
Directory from dbreportfiles or<br />
else the default is the SAMPro Base Directory.</p>
<h3>1.2.3 Select Documents Tab</h3>
<p><font style="font-weight: bold;">New Field:</font> <font style="font-weight: bold;">Omit Booked Invoices?<br /></font>When this field is flagged, only those documents related to invoices that have not yet been included in a Book document will be included list when the Autopopulate button is clicked.</p>
<h3>1.2.4 Emailing Books</h3>
<p>Outlook may have issues with pathing on multiple attachments. When the Email button is clicked in the Book viewer, the SAMPro mailer is now launched if multiple attachments exist, even if UseOutlook is set to True in the sys-email registry. If only a single attachment exists, the Outlook Email form will be used if UseOutlook is set to true.</p>
<h3>1.2.6 Revised PdfJoiner.jar File</h3>
<p>The revised PDFJoiner.jar file included with this release will 'flatten' (make non-editable) PDF forms that are to be merged together to allow them to be combined when the Make PDF button clicked.</p>
<p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">&#160;</p>
<h2>1.3 Reporting</h2>
<p>This release corrects a problem where reports generated as PDF's in earlier 8.2 releases did not include their logo if the report's bitmap registry entry contained the x,y offsets and/or size parameters (most users do not have these parameters set).</p>
<h3>1.3.1 Redisplaying Saved Reports</h3>
<p>When a report is archived, the bitmap path is now saved in the dbr file itself, so that the registry is not required to display the desired bitmap when the report is redisplayed. If the saved report is from an earlier release where the bitmap path was not saved, the applicable registry entry will be used. This functionality has been expanded to the code SAMPro uses to generate the XML file used by the xmltopdf.jar file so that .PDF’s are also generated correctly.</p>
<h3>1.3.2 Document Management – PDF and DBR Reports</h3>
<p>Although SAMPro supports saving/archiving Invoices as PDFs there is a downside.&#160;&#160;Specifically, viewing saved PDF documents is not done 'within' SAMPro; this means that SAMPro’s Email Report option is not available from the PDF document reader.</p>
<p>The registry setting described below allows for the DBR and the PDF versions of saved report to coexist.&#160;&#160;Viewing the saved document from within SAMPro uses the DBR version.&#160;&#160;Viewing from the DBAnalytics framework uses the PDF version.&#160;&#160;This feature eliminates the need to have DBRs converted to PDFs before emailing to DBAnalytics and FMAnywhere users.&#160;&#160;Instead, the PDF can be viewed instantly from within the browser.</p>
<p>To use this new feature you must add the following registry entry:<br />
Id: sys-ffv-global-settings</p>
<p>Setting Key: UseConvertedDBRs &#160;Setting Value: true<br />
<br />
When implemented, the system converts DBR documents to archived pdf documents and saves original archive DBR file in the ConvertedDBRs subfolder, within the appropriate Month/Year directory.</p>
<h3>1.3.3 Converting Large Reports to PDF</h3>
<p>This release addresses the problem of running very large reports and then saving them to PDF after they had previewed on the screen. In previous versions, this could fail when Smalltalk ran out of memory.&#160;&#160;In this release, the XML generation has been changed from running in memory to running in WriteStream. A temporary file will be generated by WriteStream; it will be</p>
<p style="margin-left: 36.00pt;">Saved in the basedir/username directory.</p>
<p style="margin-left: 36.00pt;">The temp filename includes the time (tempXML_HHMMSS) in the name.</p>
<p style="margin-left: 36.00pt;">The temp file is removed at the end of the process.</p>
<p>In addition, a registry entry has been added to support increased memory for the Java run time: this setting is only necessary for someone attempting to convert a very large report into a PDF.&#160;&#160;When the new setting is present, XMLtoPDF is instructed to allocate more memory for the Java run time so that it can process the larger XML files without running out of memory.</p>
<p style="margin-left: 36.00pt;">Registry Id: sys-ffv-global-settings<br />
Setting Key: vmflagsxmltopdf &#160;Setting Value: -Xms800m -Xmx800m</p>
<p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">&#160;</p>
<h3>1.3.4 Viewer List Reports</h3>
<p>The Export column in User Group Functions determines whether the List contents of a viewer may be printed or exported to a .csv file.&#160;&#160;The Export box should be checked for User Group All for all viewers but is not for some of our more recent additions.&#160;To correct this issue, the validation code has been changed so that it assumes access/exporting is ALWAYS available when the user belongs to group ALL.</p>
<h3>1.3.5 Registry to Set Document Record's FM, CRM, Sub or Tech Viewable Fields When a Report is Auto-Attached</h3>
<p><span id="BugEvents2222">This release adds the ability to set the Document's 'Viewable' flags when a report is auto-attached to an applicable record.</span></p>

<h3>1.3.6 Printer Selection Box</h3>
<p>This release corrects an issue where the Printer Dialog box could sometimes show an incorrect list of printers. In this version, the system obtains the printer list from the 'enumPrinters' Windows subroutine instead of the &#160;WIN.INI file as in previous releases.</p>
<p>In the unlikely event that it is necessary to override the new behavior, use the 'sys-printernames' registry entry and the following option:</p>
<p style="margin-left: 48px;">Setting Key: method &#160;Setting Value: winini</p>
<p>Any other value will cause the new default mechanism to be used.</p>
<h3>1.3.7 &#160;'olddialog' Printing Option</h3>
<p>In previous releases, if the olddialog was enabled in sys-printer-dialog-ssrvcebllngcmpte, the posting report would launch when the user said 'No' to the print confirmation.&#160;In addition, invoices were prematurely e-mailed before the print confirmation. This release eliminates premature emailing for service invoicing when olddialog is enabled.</p>
<p style="margin-left: 48px; font-weight: bold;">'olddialog' Limitations<br />
<span style="font-weight: normal;">Multiple copies/collating are not supported with the 'olddialog' option.</span> &#160;&#160;</p>
<h3>1.3.8 Record Viewer and Report Filtering</h3>
<p style="margin-left: 8px; font-weight: normal;">This releases supports the use of the double hyphen character combination to disable the rest of the characters on the line.&#160;&#160;</p>
<p style="font-weight: bold; margin-left: 48px;"><span style="font-weight: normal;">Examples:<br />
<br />
'--A,B,C' ... removes the filter value entirely<br />
'A,B --,C' ... removes 'C' from the list</span></p>
<h3 class="Support">1.3.9 Printer Registries&#160;(sys-printer-<span style="font-style: italic;"><i>reportid</i></span>)</h3>
<p>Previously, if a 'sys-printer-XXX' entry existed for a report function (e.g., setting the COP Invoice to Portrait), the report always printed to the user's default printer. In this release, the printer dialog box will appear unless the appropriate 'defaultprinter' option exists in the registry.</p>
<h3>1.3.9 Printer Selection</h3>
<p style="margin-left: 8px; font-weight: normal;">This release corrects an OS error 122 when getting the list of printers from SAMPro where a very large number of printers are available to a user. &#160;</p>
<h3>1.3.10 Password Protect Non-Section Key Reports Autosaved as PDF's</h3>
<p>An updated XmlToPdf.jar file (dated 1/16/2014 or later) and the following registry entry(ies) are required to implement this behavior for reports which do NOT contain section logic. These settings can be used to password protect PDF files which are auto-saved.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes;">&#160;</span>&#160;Note that the registry must also include the applicable autosave (or autosavewhenprinted), autosavefilename, and autosavedirectory entries.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes;">&#160;</span>&#160;In addition, the autosavefiletype option MUST be set to PDF (Setting Key: autosavefiletype<span style="mso-spacerun: yes;">&#160;</span>&#160;Setting Value: PDF).</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: bold;">Id:</span> sys-report-<span style="font-style: italic;"><i>functionid &#160;&#160;</i></span>(be sure to implement for all Branch and or Security entries)</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: bold;">Setting Key:</span> ReportPasswordProtect &#160;&#160;<span style="font-weight: bold;">Setting Value:</span> true</p>
<p>This option implements password protection for this report.</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: bold;">Setting Key:</span> ReportUserPassword &#160;&#160;&#160;<span style="font-weight: bold;">Setting Value:</span> <span style="font-style: italic;"><i>password</i></span></p>
<p>This option specifies the password required to open the auto-saved report. &#160;Note that if this password is changed, reports created with earlier password still require the earlier password to open.</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: bold;">Setting Key:</span> ReportOwnerPassword &#160;&#160;<span style="font-weight: bold;">Setting Value:</span> <span style="font-style: italic;"><i>password</i></span></p>
<p>A default Owner password (for Data-Basics Support only) will be used unless one is set through this registry entry.</p>
<h3><span style="font-weight: bold;">1.3.11 User Defined Reports:</span></h3>
<p>This release corrects the column header display if the point size is changed.</p>
<h3>1.3.12 Reporting - Override Global Preview Reports as PDF Option</h3>
<p>The setting the sys-ffv-global-settings option PreviewReportsAsPDF to true results in all reports (except posting reports such as service invoice) being displayed as PDF's when they are run. This release provides the ability to disable this functionality on an individual report basis by implementing the following registry:</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: bold;">Id:</span> sys-report-<span style="font-style: italic;"><i>reportfunctionid</i></span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: bold;">Setting Key:</span> PreviewReportsAsPDF &#160;&#160;<span style="font-weight: bold;">Setting Value:</span> false</p>
<h2>1.4 Notes</h2>
<p style="margin-left: 8px;">The Notes button displays the blank Note icon if only Obsoleted notes (or no notes) are attached.</p>
<p style="margin-left: 8px;">This release corrects spurious "Change Record?" and "You cannot change the record" messages when using the Next/Previous buttons to scroll through regular Notes records.</p>
<p><font style="font-weight: bold;">New Field -</font> <font style="font-weight: bold;">Obsolete:<br /></font> If this field is checked, the record is considered Obsolete, and will not appear on the active notes list. Obsoleted Notes can be accessed by clearing the Notes Obsolete field (accessed via the Find Data button). The Obsolete option can be undone when necessary.</p>
<p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">&#160;</p>
<p><img src="image/SKIN1_SendEmail.gif" alt="image\SKIN1_SendEmail.gif" title="image\SKIN1_SendEmail.gif" width="94" height="28" border="0" /> The Email button has been added to side button bar so that the user can e-mail the note directly. When the Email button is clicked, the SAMPro mailer will appear. The Note Summary will be defaulted to the Subject, and the Note Text will appear in the body of the e-mail. This functionality does not currently support UseOutlook.</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: bold;">New Field: Contact Id</span><br />
The Contact Id gives the user access to SAMPro Contact records and the email addresses contained in them. When a Contact record is selected, SAMPro automatically inserts its main email address in the Email To field, adding it to the existing list of recipients. &#160;</p>
<p>In addition, when the Contact record contains multiple addresses, they are added to the list of Email Addresses displayed when the user double-clicks in the Email To or CC fields. This will allow the SAMPro user to select one of the Contact's secondary email addresses.</p>
<h2>1.5 Expand Smalltalk Memory to 600 MB</h2>
<p>SAMPro’s Smalltalk virtual memory has been expanded to 600MB from 500MB to better accommodate extremely long reports and the unfiltered display of history viewers.</p>
<h2>1.6 XmlToPdf.jar and PDFJoiner.jar files</h2>
<h3>1.6.1 XmlToPdf.jar File</h3>
<p>The revised file dated 2017-12-27 supports the revised W-2 reporting format. It also corrects a file 'cannot find this file' error&#160;when running with UseOutlook enabled.</p>
<h3>1.6.2 PDFJoiner File</h3>
<p>The PDFJoiner.jar (revised 12/4/2014) and XmlToPdf.jar files&#160;included with this image supports PDF's generated by scanners using newer PDF standards.</p>
<h2>1.7 WebHelp</h2>
<p>This release corrects the WebHelp map update so that the message is not repeatedly displayed.</p>
<p>The WebHelp distributed with this release of SAMPro supports Internet Explorer 10 and 11. It also supports earlier versions of IE, as well as current versions of Firefox and Chrome (when run from your firm's network).</p>
<p>If Internet Explorer is your default browser, the 'Allow active content to run on files in My Computer' <span style="text-decoration: underline;"><u>must</u></span> be enabled for WebHelp's Search function to work properly (and without having to "Allow Active Contact" every time you access WebHelp). If the Search tab in WebHelp looks like the following, active content is NOT being allowed.</p>
<p><img src="image4.jpg" alt="" style="border: none;" width="243" height="346" border="0" /></p>
<p>The above Search tab is less than useless, and you need to allow active content to run in files on your computer. To allow active content (without having to confirm the "Allow Active Content" browser message each time you run WebHelp), access the following screen by going to Internet Explorer's Tools menu and select Internet Options. This field is set on the Advanced tab, under Security.</p>
<p><img src="image2.jpg" alt="" style="border: none;" width="396" height="507" border="0" /></p>
<p>Close and restart WebHelp; your Search tab should look like the following. &#160;You may Search throughout WebHelp for words, registry ids, setting keys, and so on. &#160;The Search function will return ranked results:</p>
<p style="font-weight: bold;"><img src="image7.jpg" alt="" style="border: none;" width="705" height="520" border="0" /></p>
<p>&#160;</p>
<p>If IE 10 or 11 is your default browser, it is no longer necessary to run with 'Display Intranet Sites in Compatibility View' checked if active content is allowed to run on your computer. This option (accessed from IE's Tool &gt; Compatibility Views settings) may be cleared.</p>
<p><img src="image3.jpg" alt="" style="border: none;" width="331" height="390" border="0" /></p>
<h2>1.8&#160;Registry Viewer</h2>
<p>Double-clicking in the Registry Viewer’s Setting Value now displays a list of options for selected Registry Id’s. After selecting an entry, the user must then edit the entry so that:</p>
<p>The Setting Key only contains the text before (to the left of) the equal sign</p>
<p>The Setting Value contains the desire value following the equal sign (not including the brackets)</p>
<p style="margin-left: 36.00pt;">For example, if the sys-ffv-global-settings COPDropShipReceipts={serialized,manual} was selected, it would be edited as follows:</p>
<p style="margin-left: 36.00pt;">Setting Key: COPDropShipReceipts</p>
<p style="margin-left: 36.00pt;">Setting Value: manual</p>
<p style="margin-left: 36.00pt;">Notice that both the equal sign and the brackets have been removed.</p>
<h2>1.9 Quick Attach</h2>
<p>Quick Attach is now supported in the Site Equipment, Job Cost Code, and Job Billing Item viewers. In previous releases, Quick Attach did not handle these dual-key records.</p>
<p>In recent releases, the Quick Attach Description only retained text generated via registry. Now text entered by the user when the Wizard is run is also retained.</p>
<p>This release corrects a sporadic 'key is missing' error when attaching documents to AP Journal entries referencing a PO which did not point to a Job or Work Order.</p>
<h3>1.9.1 Quick Attach / AP Journal</h3>
<p>This release corrects a timing issue that could result in duplicate Vendor Invoices being generated if Quick Attach failed due to file access errors. In addition, Quick Attach opens the copied file in the 'Save' directory. &#160;The copied file retains its original filename; if a conflict exists it will be saved with a copy number appended to the file base name (like Windows). If (2) exists then (3) and so on.</p>
<h3>1.9.2 Detailed Description of New Quick Attach Functionality</h3>
<p>In previous releases, the Quick Attach functionality could not be used to attach files to records that could not be saved: this was a particular problem with the AP Journal. This enhancement changes Quick Attach so that the file is immediately attached to existing records, and to new records when they are added. Since it is no longer necessary to save an existing record to attach the file, Quick Attach may be used for locked Journal Entries and other records.</p>
<p>In this release, if QuickAttach is enabled for a viewer, pressing the button opens a browser with the directory to the QuickAttachOpenPath (defined via registry), and then shows all files in that directory. The user should then select the correct file and click Open. Once you select a file Windows will open the appropriate viewer (e.g., MS Paint, or the Adobe Reader). Simply close this as usual.</p>
<p>At this point, SAM Pro’s Select Options for Attaching a Document prompter window will appear. The Category and Description fields will default from the applicable registry settings, but may be changed by the user.</p>
<p>Pressing OK on the Prompter Window</p>
<p style="margin-left: 36.00pt;">- Attaches the file by creating a new document record that references the existing record immediately or the new record when it is created</p>
<p style="margin-left: 36.00pt;">- AND deletes the attached file from the QuickAttachOpenPath directory</p>
<p>Pressing Cancel</p>
<p style="margin-left: 36.00pt;">- Simply clears the cache: the file is not deleted from the QuickAttachOpenPath directory, and is also not attached to the record.</p>
<h3>1.9.3 Quick Attach - Multiple File Handling</h3>
<p style="margin-left: 8px;">This release corrects the "The system cannon find the file specified" runtime error if a user started but did NOT complete a new transaction after selecting files for attachment. &#160;In this release, the system clears the collection of file names when New Record button or Refresh button is pushed.</p>
<p style="margin-left: 8px;">In addition, SAMPro now prompts the user when multiple files have been selected:</p>
<p style="margin-left: 48px;">NOTICE: The following files are pending attachment to this record.<br />
Click 'Yes' to keep these pending files for attachment, and add a new one.<br />
Click 'No' to clear this pending list, and just add a new one.</p>

<p><font style="font-weight: bold;">Common Phrases</font> <font style="font-weight: bold;">User 1-5:<br /></font>These fields may be used by TechAnywhere assist in filtering records for TechAnywhere access, or for entering any information your company wishes to retain.</p>
<h2>1.11 Custom Field</h2>
<p><font style="font-weight: bold;">Changed Field: Default Value<br /></font>This release extends the Custom Field Default Value functionally to Check Boxes, Radio Buttons, Integer, Decimal, Date and Time fields. <font style="font-weight: bold;">These fields should only be set on record header fields.</font></p>
<p style="margin-left: 36.00pt;"><font style="font-weight: bold;">Note:</font> Certain fields are hard-coded to specific values. In these cases, the Default Value you entered will be overridden by the hard-coded value.</p>
<p>Custom Fields must be enabled in the user's User Groups and Functions (typically, only an Admin would have this privilege).</p>
<p style="margin-left: 36.00pt; font-weight: bold; text-decoration: underline;">Set the Default Value of a Check Box</p>
<p style="margin-left: 36.00pt;">1. Go to the viewer you wish to customize, and select and right-click on the check box you wish to set to checked. Click 'Yes' when the system asks if you wish to customize this field.</p>
<p style="margin-left: 36.00pt;">2. When the Custom Fields viewer opens, enter a Y in the Default Value header field, and save the Custom Fields record (NOTE: for Boolean-type fields, only the first character of the Default Value field is evaluated. If the first character is 't', 'T', 'y' or 'Y', then the field defaults to True.)</p>
<p style="margin-left: 36.00pt;">3. <font style="font-weight: bold; font-style: italic; text-decoration: underline;">Close and re-open your original viewer.</font> When you click the New button, the check box you customized should now default to checked when you start a new record.</p>
<p class="Support" style="margin-left: 66.25pt;">&#160;</p>
<p style="margin-left: 36.00pt; font-weight: bold; text-decoration: underline;">Set the Default Value of a Radio Button</p>
<p style="margin-left: 36.00pt;">1. Go to the viewer you wish to customize. Carefully note the exact spelling of the radio button you wish to select as the default. Select and right-click on the radio button, and then click 'Yes' when the system asks if you wish to customize this field.</p>
<p style="margin-left: 36.00pt;">2. Set the Default Value in the Custom Fields viewer to the exact spelling of the radio button. Specifying an unsupported value results in no button being selected. Save the Custom Fields record.</p>
<p style="margin-left: 36.00pt;">3. <font style="font-weight: bold; font-style: italic; text-decoration: underline;">Close and re-open your original viewer.</font> When you click the New button, the radio button you set as default should be selected when you start a new record.<br /></p>
<p style="margin-left: 36.00pt; font-weight: bold; text-decoration: underline;">Set the Default Value of a Integer or Decimal Field</p>
<p style="margin-left: 36.00pt;">1. Go to the viewer you wish to customize. Carefully note the format of the field so that the default value you enter does not exceed the size of the field. Select and right-click on the field, and then click 'Yes' when the system asks if you wish to customize this field.</p>
<p style="margin-left: 36.00pt;">2. Set the Default Value in the Custom Fields viewer to the integer or decimal value desired. Errors WILL occur if the user-specified default value isn't appropriate for the field type.</p>
<p style="margin-left: 36.00pt;">3. <font style="font-weight: bold; font-style: italic; text-decoration: underline;">Close and re-open your original viewer.</font> When you click the New button, the integer or decimal field should be set to the default value you specified.<br /></p>
<p style="margin-left: 36.00pt; font-weight: bold; text-decoration: underline;">Set the Default Date / or Time</p>
<p style="margin-left: 36.00pt;">Date and Time include special support for <font style="font-weight: bold;">now</font> entered in the Default Value which sets the default value the current system date/time.</p>
<p style="margin-left: 36.00pt;">1. Go to the viewer you wish to customize, and select and right-click on the date or time field you wish to default. Click 'Yes' when the system asks if you wish to customize this field.</p>
<p style="margin-left: 36.00pt;">2. When the Custom Fields viewer opens, enter <font style="font-weight: bold;">now</font> in the Default Value header field, and save the Custom Fields record</p>
<p style="margin-left: 36.00pt;">3. <font style="font-weight: bold; font-style: italic; text-decoration: underline;">Close and re-open your original viewer.</font> When you click the New button, the date/time field you customized should now default to the current system value when you start a new record.</p>

<h2>1.12 Document Management</h2>
<p>The Start Document Archive Maintenance function has been enhanced to create a .pdf if the original file is missing but a .xml file with the same base name exists in the directory.</p>
<p>Corrects a sporadic document locking issue in the Scan Document Wizard.</p>
<p>In this release, the Show Document button successfully checks for child subfolders when looking for the Other Files tab documents to display.</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: bold;">Changed Field: &#160;</span><span id="BugEvents2221" style="font-weight: bold;">Web Viewable FM?</span> <span><br />
This field was previously labeled Web Viewable CRM?. &#160;It determines if an FMAnywhere (or old CRM/Client Web Interface) Web User will have access to this document.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: bold;">Changed Field: &#160;</span><span id="BugEvents222121" style="font-weight: bold;">Web Viewable CRM?</span> <span><br />

<h3>1.12.1 XMLToPDF Processing</h3>
<p>Corrects a problem with source file path containing spaces when creating PDFs.</p>
<h3>1.12.2 Start Archive Document Maintenance - Move Original Docs</h3>
<p>The Archive Document Maintenance function processes documents, makes sure they are archived and moves the archived documents to sub folders (month/year). &#160;However, the original document (in most cases invoices) remains in the folders. This enhancement validates that the document has been archived and moves the original document to a 'processed' folder. &#160;This provides a better way to identify original documents that can be moved to offline storage.</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: bold;">New Field: Move Original Docs</span><br />
This box must be checked to enable the above functionality.</p>
<p>The following registry is required for this:</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: bold;">Registry Id:</span> sys-start-sdcmntarchvemntnnce</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: bold;">Setting Key:</span> ProcessDirectory <span style="font-weight: bold;">Setting Value:</span> path to directory to copy original documents</p>
<h3>1.12.3 &#160;Document Archive Maintenance - Force Archive</h3>
<p style="margin-left: 8px; font-weight: bold;">New Option: Force Archive:&#160;&#160;</p>
<p style="margin-left: 8px;">When this option is enabled, this function ignores the presence of a value in dcmnt.dcmnt_fle_lctn_archve and copies the original source document (if available) over top of the previously archived file. This option would be used to help recover archived files if, for example, the machine they resided on was infected by a virus, resulting in the files being corrupted.<br />
<br />
<span style="font-weight: bold;">New Ranges:</span><br />
Logged By: Enter the user's Id to process only those documents they logged by them. Filter this function to multiple users by specifying a comma-separated list of Id's.<br />
&#160;<br />
<span style="font-weight: bold;">File Location:</span><br />
To limit this function to a specific folder or file, enter the completed path (including the filename) to the original file<br />
<span style="font-weight: bold;">New Registry Option:</span><br />
<span style="font-weight: bold;">Registry Id:</span> sys-start-sdcmntarchvemntnnce<br />
<span style="font-weight: bold;">Setting Key:</span> ForceArchive&#160;&#160;Setting Value: true<br />
<br />
This registry sets the default value of the Force Archive option to checked for the manual Start Document Archive Maintenance function and the Start Document Archive Maintenance (Automated) function. Typically, this would only be set if there was a problem with lost or corruption of archived files. Shouldn't be used for normal archive maintenance cycles.</p>
<h3>1.12.4 Scanning With NAPS2</h3>
<h5>Overview</h5>
<p class="MsoNormal">SAMPro has used a program called Acquire for a long time to interface the program to the local scanner. This program has not been updated or changed in many years. Due to the introduction of 64bit machines and newer Operating Systems, there have been problems with some environments recently. Due to this, we have another created another method for scanning. The program is called NAPS2. The current version is 2.6.3.</p>
<p class="MsoNormal">The NAPS2 interface may be enabled for all users or on a user by user basis via registry. &#160;</p>
<h5>Installation</h5>
<p class="MsoListParagraph" style="text-indent: -.25in; mso-list: l0 level1 lfo1;"><span style="mso-bidi-font-family: Calibri; mso-bidi-theme-font: minor-latin;"><span style="mso-list: Ignore;">1.<span style="font: 7.0pt 'Times New Roman';"><font size="1" style="font-size:7pt;">&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;</font></span></span></span>&#160;You must install your current scanner to the PC. You must install at least the WIA driver for your particular scanner. You can also install the TWAIN driver if provided. Please verify that you scanner will work on the PC. Once that is done, you will need to install the SAMPro scanner software.</p>
<p class="MsoListParagraph" style="text-indent: -.25in; mso-list: l0 level1 lfo1;"><span style="mso-bidi-font-family: Calibri; mso-bidi-theme-font: minor-latin; mso-list: Ignore;">2.&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;</span>&#160;Install the SAMPro interface software (naps2-2.6.3-setup.exe); this will be available from your SAMPro support representative. Install the program on every PC that is going to scan using this protocol. Once set up, you must open up the program and set up a Profile.</p>

The <b style="mso-bidi-font-weight: normal;">name is IMPORTANT</b> because it is the profile SAMPro will reference. In this example, I will name it SamproWIA.</p>

<p class="MsoNormal" style="margin-left: .5in;">You can use either the TWAIN Driver or the WIA Driver. We recommend using the WIA Driver since it is the default in most Windows versions. Click on the Choose Device button and select the scanner you will use.</p>
<p class="MsoNormal" style="margin-left: .5in;">There are two settings that can be used. One is the “Use predefined settings” and the other is “Use native WIA UI”. If you use the predefined settings, you can set all of the settings that will be used EVERY time you scan. If this is not acceptable, you can use the native WIA settings. This will pull up the software interface that was installed with your scanner. This will allow you to change settings each time you scan. There is a process when using this setting which will be explained later.</p>
<p class="MsoNormal" style="margin-left: .5in;"><span style="mso-no-proof: yes;"><img src="clip_image005.jpg" alt="" width="391" height="409" border="0" /></span></p>

There are two ways to set up the registries in SAMPro. Either in the sys-document-archive (global setup) or in the user record's Registry tab. The settings are the same, just in different places.</p>

<p class="MsoNormal" style="margin-left: .5in;">The scanProgramName will always be NAPS2</p>
<p class="MsoNormal" style="margin-left: .5in;">The scanProgram MUST reference the directory where it was actually installed. Note the .exe file is NAPS2.Console.exe, not the NAPS2.exe</p>
<p class="MsoNormal" style="margin-left: .5in;">The scanProfile is the name you put in NAPS2 when you created the Profile. They must be identical.</p>
<p class="MsoNormal" style="margin-left: .25in;">The registries must be entered in the User record or…….</p>
<p class="MsoNormal" style="margin-left: .25in;"><span style="mso-no-proof: yes;"><img src="clip_image007.jpg" alt="" width="509" height="311" border="0" /></span></p>

<p class="MsoNormal" style="margin-left: .25in;">Scanning is the same as Acquire. If you decided to use the native software UI, there is one thing to Note. There will be two windows that open up: the NAPS2 Console in a command prompt window and the native software UI. The UI may be behind the console.</p>
<p class="MsoNormal" style="margin-left: .25in;"><span style="mso-no-proof: yes;"><img src="clip_image011.jpg" alt="" width="577" height="310" border="0" /></span></p>
<p class="MsoNormal" style="margin-left: .25in;">You can minimize the Console, but do NOT CLOSE it. When you are done scanning, you will need to close the UI interface by closing the window by way of the “X”. Do not cancel, or you will not have a scan to be saved. After you close the UI, the console will automatically close.</p>
<h2>1.13 Accounting Period</h2>
<p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span id="BugEvents272">In this release, validation ensures that the End Date does NOT precede the Start Date when the record is saved.&#160;Note that it is not an error when the Start Date and End Date are the same.</span></p>
<p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">&#160;</p>
<h2>1.14 <span>L</span>aunching External Applications</h2>
<p>By default, SAMPro now consults the Windows registry for the correct program to use when opening application files. However if sys-openapp-commmands exists it overrides the Windows registry.</p>
<p>The sys-openapp-commands registry entry may be needed to enable SAMPro to override certain Windows registries regarding file associations. For example, if you attempt to view a scanned document from within SAM Pro, the message ‘Application not found’ might be displayed unless the registry is in effect.&#160;In previous releases, it was necessary to enclose the launch command in double quotes if the path to the executable included one or more spaces. &#160;&#160;In this version, either of the following Setting would work (assuming the executable is available).</p>
<p style="margin-left: 48px;">Setting Value: "C:\Program Files (x86)\Corel\Corel Graphics 11\Programs\CorelPP.exe"</p>

<h3>1.14.1 &#160;Server 2008 R2 64 and Picture Files</h3>
<p>This release corrects a problem when users were not able to open picture files (jpg and jpegs) in Windows 8 running on Server 2008 R2 64 bit. It may also be necessary to enter the following registry entries for your Windows 7 and 8 users to successfully view these files.</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: bold;">Id:</span> sys-openapp-commands</p>
<p><font style="font-weight: bold;">Setting Key:</font> jpg</p>

<p style="font-weight: bold;">Setting Value:</p>
<p>&#160;"rundll32.exe" "c:\Program Files\Windows Photo Viewer\PhotoViewer.dll", ImageView_Fullscreen %1</p>
<p><font style="font-weight: bold;">If your</font> <font style="font-weight: bold;">users are running different versions of Windows (Vista, XP, etc.), the sys-openapp-commands registry</font> <font style="font-weight: bold;">entry must</font> <font style="font-weight: bold;">be by user.</font></p>
<h2>1.15 Viewers (General)</h2>
<p style="margin-left: 8px;">When a user changes a field in a record that has its Change button disabled (and is not in Add mode, the system now warns them that the changes can't be saved. The primary Id of the record is exempt from this processing so that the user can use it to access other records. The following registry may be used to disable this functionality. &#160;</p>
<p style="margin-left: 8px;"><span style="font-weight: bold;">Id:</span> sys-ffv-global-settings &#160;(to disable everywhere)</p>
<p style="margin-left: 8px;"><span style="font-weight: bold;">Id:</span> sys-viewer-vfunctionid &#160;(to disable by viewers - sys-viewer-vjb to disable in the Job Viewer)</p>

<p style="margin-left: 8px;">This release also acorrects a sporadic 'key is missing' error filtering lists when the column compression limit is exceeded.</p>
<h3>1.15.1 Right-Click Enhancements</h3>
<h5><span style="font-weight: bold;">Non-Id Fields:</span></h5>
<p>When the user right clicks on a non-Id, data entry field a menu pops up. This menu displays the following options:</p>
<p style="margin-left: 88px;">Copy (Ctrl+C)<br />
Paste (Ctrl+V)<br />

<p style="margin-left: 8px;">To select an option with the mouse, click on that option. To exist the menu without a selection, click off of the menu.</p>
<p style="margin-left: 8px;">To select an option with the keyboard, use the Up or Down arrow key to highlight the option, and then press Enter to select it. To exit the menu without making a selection using the keyboard, press Esc (Escape).</p>
<p style="margin-left: 8px;">This enhancement makes it easier to copy a field's contents to the clipboard, or paste copied text to the field. The keyboard shortcuts of Ctrl+C and Ctrl+V continue to be supported.</p>
<h5>Id Fields:</h5>
<p style="margin-left: 8px;">Normally, right clicking on an Id field will bring up a Viewer for the parent record. If the user would like to see the above menu instead, the user should hold down the Control key while doing the right click.</p>
<h5>Notes Text Field:</h5>
<p style="margin-left: 8px;">When the user right clicks in the Notes text field, a menu pops up with the options of Copy and Paste. &#160;</p>
<p>To select an option with the mouse, click on that option. To exit the menu without a selection, click off of the menu.</p>
<p>To select an option with the keyboard, use the Up or Down arrow key to highlight the option, and then press Enter to select it. To exit the menu without making a selection using the keyboard, press Esc (Escape).</p>
<p>Notes text may be selected to copy by holding down the left mouse button while scrolling. The selected text may be copied via the right-click menu, or by pressing Ctrl+C.</p>
<h3><span style="font-weight: bold;">1.15.2 Notes Viewer</span></h3>
<p>This release corrects a recent problem in the Notes viewer where Edit-&gt;Paste pasted two copies of the text.</p>
<p>The presence of the pipe character in a field causes the database to ignoring any following text. When you type a pipe character, a space will be now be inserted instead of the pipe. When you paste a string containing a pipe (from the Edit menu or Control-V) any pipe characters will be pasted as a space character.</p>
<h3>1.15.3 Disable Fields Registry Supports Buttons</h3>
<p>The registry to disable fields may also be used to disable a viewer's buttons on the parent or child tabs. The button's field name must be referenced in the registry - it is displayed to the right in the status pane when you position the mouse cursor at the extreme upper left corner of the button.</p>
<p style="font-weight: bold; text-decoration: underline;">Example: &#160;Registry to Disable "Add Taxes" button on AP Journal Viewer</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: bold;">Id:</span> sys-viewer-vapjrnl</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: bold;">Setting Key:</span> disabledFieldsParent &#160;&#160;<span style="font-weight: bold;">Setting Value:</span> push-addTaxAuth</p>

<h3>1.15.4 &#160;Required and Disabled Fields Options Support Multiple Lines</h3>
<p>The RequiredFields and DisabledFields registries did not allow some of our users tag enough fields as required or disabled due to long field names and the character limit of the Setting Value. This release extends multiple registry line support to the RequiredFieldsParent, RequiredFields<span style="font-style: italic;"><i>child</i></span>, DisabledFieldsParent, and DisabledFields<span style="font-style: italic;"><i>child</i></span> Setting Keys.</p>
<p style="margin-left: 48px; text-decoration: underline;">Example:Client Site</p>
<p style="margin-left: 48px;">Id: sys-viewer-vclntste</p>
<p style="margin-left: 48px;">Setting Key: RequiredFieldsParent &#160;Setting Value: jb.lcl: txathrty.id,rteschdle.id</p>
<p style="margin-left: 48px;">Setting Key: RequiredFieldsParent &#160;Setting Value: jb.gl-ar: glaccnt.id</p>
<p style="margin-left: 48px;">…. And additional lines as needed</p>
<h3>1.15.5 Documents</h3>
<p style="margin-left: 8px;">This release disables the requirement that Java is installed when viewing a PDF from SAMPro. &#160;Java must still be installed in order to generate a PDF.</p>
<h2>1.16 <span style="font-weight: bold;">Canadian Users</span></h2>
<p>This release corrects date-related errors that occurred if the Windows localization settings (which control the OS's date format) were for Canada. &#160;In this release, the system now works correctly if National Language Date Format = YYYY-MM-DD (e.g. Canada) or = 'DD-MM-YYYY' &#160;as well as for United States users.</p>
<h2>1.17 Logon Process</h2>
<p>Corrects a stack overflow issue encountered by some Sybase users attempting to log onto SAMPro.</p>
<p>This release manages network issues to avoid "WARNING: SAMPRO's bitmap file (master ~ pushbuttons.obj) is either missing or corrupted" errors when logging onto SAMPro.</p>
<h2>1.18 Filtering</h2>
<h3>1.18.1 Ampersand (&amp;) in Filter Range implements 'AND' option</h3>
<p>When the Ampersand character (&amp;) is used as the first character in a filter range list, ALL of the elements in the list must be true to return a result.</p>
<p style="font-weight: bold;">Example: Inventory Item</p>
<p>In the Inventory Item Name range: &#160;&amp;1%,%pex%,%g</p>
<p>The system will only return items whose name begins with '1', ends with 'g', and has 'pex' somewhere in the middle.</p>
<h2>1.19 Positive Pay</h2>
<h3>1.19.1 Positive Pay (Dollar Bank)</h3>
<p>This release supports Positive Pay for Dollar Bank. If your checks are run against multiple GL Account/Entity combinations, a registry entry should be created for each one for which positive pay reporting is desired. The following registry settings are required:</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: bold;">Id:</span> sys-positive-pay</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: bold;">Setting Key:</span> Format&#160;&#160;<span style="font-weight: bold;">Setting Value:</span> DollarBank</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: bold;">Setting Key:</span> AccountNo&#160;&#160;<span style="font-weight: bold;">Setting Value:</span> as provided by the bank</p>
<p>The filename registry is optional, If you do not use this option, the system will prompt you to select a name and directory for this file. Typically, this option would be used if multiple branches run this report. Typically, the extension is set to txt. The file will be created in the working directory where the SAM Pro executable v.exe is running.</p>
<p><font style="font-weight: bold;">Setting Key:</font> filename <font style="font-weight: bold;">Setting Value:</font> <font style="font-style: italic;">yourfilename^date^^time^.txt</font></p>
<h3>1.19.2 Positive Pay (Anchor Bank)</h3>
<p>This release supports Positive Pay for Anchor Bank. If your checks are run against multiple GL Account/Entity combinations, a registry entry should be created for each one for which positive pay reporting is desired. The following registry settings are required:</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: bold;">Id:</span> sys-positive-pay &#160;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: bold;">Setting Key:</span> Format&#160;&#160;<span style="font-weight: bold;">Setting Value:</span> AnchorBank</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: bold;">Setting Key:</span> AccountNo&#160;&#160;<span style="font-weight: bold;">Setting Value:</span> as provided by the bank</p>
<p>The filename registry is optional, If you do not use this option, the system will prompt you to select a name and directory for this file. Typically, this option would be used if multiple branches run this report. Typically, the extension is set to txt. The file will be created in the working directory where the SAM Pro executable v.exe is running.</p>
<p><font style="font-weight: bold;">Setting Key:</font> filename <font style="font-weight: bold;">Setting Value:</font> <font style="font-style: italic;">yourfilename^date^^time^.ext</font></p>
<h2>1.20 Start Field Label Remapping</h2>
<p>In previous releases, a customization was required to change a label not directly associated with a field. An example is on the Site's parent Contact tab: the Site Contact 1: label over the contact information block. In this release, access to these labels has been added to the Start Field Label Remapping function.</p>
<p>When this function run, it will create or update a dictionary file called 'LabelRemap' that contains the field label replacements that you specify. This file should live in the same directory as the Data-Basics executable, v.exe. 'LabelRemap' is loaded on startup of the Data-Basics software. This file should only be edited by running the Start Field Label Remapping function, and <font style="font-weight: bold;">should be backed up on a regular basis</font>.</p>
<h5>Example: Customizing the Site Contact 1: label</h5>
<p>1. Run 'Start Field Label Remapping', the system will display an Open File dialog box, which should already should point to the LabelRemap file in the directory containing the SAMPro executable. Select Open.</p>
<p>2. The Initial Screen will display a Field Label filter which enables you to filter down which labels will be presented for possible renaming. For example, if you wanted to relabel the Site Contact 1: you could enter Site Contact 1: in the Field Label and then click Go.</p>
<p>3. A List will appear:</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: bold;">Field Label:</span><br />
This display-only field lists the standard field label used within the software.</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: bold;">Field Label Replacement:</span><br />
If this field is blank, the standard label (displayed on the left) will be used by the system. To replace the standard label, simply enter it as you want it displayed on the screen. To avoid screen layout difficulties, the length of the replacement label should not greatly exceed that of the standard label.</p>
<p>4. Click Go to complete the function and save the edited dictionary back to disk. Reopen the Site view to see the changes to the label.</p>
<p style="margin-left: 48px;"><span style="font-weight: bold;">Tip:</span><br />
To undo a label remapping to use the default label, simply clear the remapping field, and the system will start using the original.</p>
<h2>1.21 Disabling User Terminates Active Sessions</h2>
<p>In previous releases, a User Account could be disabled while active sessions were running for the User; Active Sessions could be terminated from View Logon History but this required additional steps. In this release, disabling a User will terminate any active sessions.</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: bold;">Changed Field: Disabled</span><br />
If this field is flagged and the AND the User Account being disabled has active sessions a warning that &#160;'Active Sessions for this User will be terminated' will be displayed. The system will terminate all active sessions when a User Account is disabled and the record is saved. &#160;</p>
<p style="margin-left: 48px;"><span style="font-weight: bold;">Note:</span> If the user being disabled has unsaved changes it may be difficult for them to exit SAMPro; we recommend that you contact the user and instruct them to exit SAMPro. The UserLogonSummary tab should be used to determine if the selected User is active.</p>
<h1>2 Client, Site and Equipment</h1>
<h2>2.1 Registry Entries</h2>
<h3>2.1.1 Clone Site Equipment PM Schedule Button</h3>
<p>In previous releases, if you created a new Site Equipment record, and then used the Clone PM button to copy an existing inspection schedule, only those PM’s that did not have a work order assigned were copied. In this release, the default functionality is to clone ALL lines that are marked OK to Renew, regardless of whether or not a work order is assigned. In this way, when the PM Agreement is renewed via Start Renew Service Contracts or Start Create New PM Work Schedule from Old, the new equipment will have a full set of inspections.</p>
<p>The following registry may be enabled to restore the previous behavior.</p>
<p><font style="font-weight: bold;">Registry Id:</font> sys-viewer-vclntsteeqpmnt</p>
<p><font style="font-weight: bold;">Setting Key:</font> clonePMScheduleIfOkToRenew <font style="font-weight: bold;">Setting Value:</font> false (default will be true)</p>
<p style="margin-left: 36.00pt;"><font style="font-weight: bold;">Note:</font> When Cloning PM Schedules a PM schedule line assigned from a master contract will never be cloned.</p>
<h3>2.1.2 Control Display of WO Tabs on Client Site Equipment Viewer</h3>

<h2>2.2 Client Site</h2>
<h3>2.2.1 Client Site PM Billing Tab</h3>
<p><font style="font-weight: bold;">Changed Field: Extended PM Invoice Description<br /></font>This field has been expanded from 400 to 3000 characters to match the WO's Work Performed field.&#160;&#160;When this field contains a value, it is written to the Invoice Description of Work Performed during the creation of PM Invoice-type work orders. Note that the older Invoice Description on the PM line is still written to the Revenue Adjustment line as in previous releases. The extended invoice description functionality is not supported by Master Contract.</p>
<p style="margin-left: 8px;"><img src="image/Magnify.gif" alt="" style="border: none;" border="0" /> Click the Magnify Button to Display</p>
<p style="margin-left: 8px; font-weight: bold;">New Field: Job Cost Category Id:</p>
<p style="margin-left: 8px;"><span id="BugEvents292">In some States certain Preventive Maintenances are taxable while others are not taxable.&#160;If completed, this field overrides the default Cost Category derived from the &#160;sys-start-scrtepmbllng registry's Cost Category option can be overridden with the value on the Site Billing Schedule line.&#160;&#160;&#160;This will allow the user full control to make the Billing taxable or non-taxable as needed.</span></p>
<p style="margin-left: 8px;"><span>This field also enables a single PM Invoice to be generated with taxable and non-taxable components. To do so, create 2 lines with the following fields entered identically, but with</span> <span style="font-weight: bold;">different</span> <span>Job Cost Categories to define the taxable and non-taxable elements:</span></p>
<p style="margin-left: 48px;"><span id="BugEvents28111">Billing Schedule Date, Job Id, Cost Code, Billing Item</span></p>
<p style="margin-left: 48px;">Tip: Invoice Description</p>
<p style="margin-left: 48px;">You may wish to edit the Invoice Description to better indicate the taxable/non-taxable (material/labor) components of the invoice).</p>
<h3>2.2.2 Client Site Service Tab</h3>
<p><font style="font-weight: bold;">Changed Field: Work Order Comments<br /></font>The Client Site Work Order Comments field has been expanded to a 1200 character text box. It may be updated by TechAnywhere users in the field.</p>
<h3>2.2.3 Client Site WO Other Tab</h3>
<p>When a work order is created in New Call, and an Other line is automatically generated from the Client Site's WO Other tab, the appropriate GL History entries will be generated if the Accounting Period’s WO Other to GL box is flagged.</p>
<p>To determine the correct Accounting Period, the system will look at the date to use on the WO Other line (either the date scheduled, or today's date if there is no scheduled date). If the date is with the default Accounting Period, it will use that. If the date is NOT within the default Accounting Period, it will find the appropriate active Accounting Period and use that.</p>
<p>The Cause Code and Resolution Codes (from the Work Order Equipment lines) have been added as columns.</p>
<h3>2.2.4 Main Tab</h3>
<p><span style="font-weight: bold;">Changed Field - &#160;Client Site Alpha Id:</span><br />
The Client Site Alpha field has been expanded to 40 characters.</p>
<h3>2.2.5 New Tab: Jobs:</h3>
<p>This tab displays all Jobs linked to the selected Client Site record. The following fields are displayed:</p>
<p style="font-weight: bold;">Job Id - Job Name - Client Id - Client Name - Job Date Closed - Job Type - Project Id &#160;</p>
<p>Double-clicking on a line opens the Job record.</p>
<h2>2.3 Client Site Equipment</h2>
<p>This release corrects a "Record not found" error that sometimes occurred when accessing equipment records from the List.</p>
<h3>2.3.1 New Tab: Open WOs</h3>
<p>This new tab lists all work orders created for this Site that have a Work Order Status Category of Open. One line will be displayed for each technician on the work order, with the Equipment filtered to the selected Equipment record only. The most recent work orders appear the top of the list. The Description column displays the Work Order Name. Double-click on a line to view the Work Order itself. See Customer Release Note 2.1.2 for registry entry to control which work orders appear on this tab.</p>
<h3>2.3.2 New Tab: Other WOs</h3>
<p>This Query View tab lists all work orders created for this Site that have a Work Order Status Category that is not set to Open (e.g., Completed, Billed, OK to Invoice, etc.). One line will be displayed for each technician on the work order, with the Equipment filtered to the selected Equipment record only. The most recent work orders appear at the top of the list. Double-click on a line to view the Work Order itself. See Customer Release Note 2.1.2 for registry entry to control which work orders appear on this tab.</p>
<h3>2.3.3 PM Schedule Tab</h3>
<p style="font-weight: bold;">Changed Button: Clone PM</p>
<p>In previous releases, if you used the Clone PM button to copy an existing inspection schedule, only those PM’s that did not have a work order assigned were copied. In this release, the default functionality is to clone ALL lines that are marked OK to Renew, regardless of whether or not a work order is assigned. In this way, when the PM Agreement is renewed via Start Renew Service Contracts or Start Create New PM Work Schedule from Old, the new equipment will have a full set of inspections. See Customer Note 2.1.1 for a registry to restore the previous behavior.</p>
<p><font style="font-weight: bold;">Registry Id:</font> sys-viewer-vclntsteeqpmnt</p>
<p><font style="font-weight: bold;">Setting Key:</font> clonePMScheduleIfOkToRenew <font style="font-weight: bold;">Setting Value:</font> false (default will be true)</p>
<p style="margin-left: 36.00pt;"><font style="font-weight: bold;">Note:</font> When Cloning PM Schedules a PM schedule line assigned from a master contract will never be cloned.</p>
<h3>2.3.4 Client Site Equipment Service Tab</h3>
<p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0; font-weight: bold;">&#160;</p>
<p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span style="font-weight: bold;">New Field - Created By:</span> If a Equipment record is created in TechAnywhere, the Technician Id is now posted to this field. If a new piece of Equipment is created in SAMPro (from New Call, Job Cloning, or by manually adding a new Equipment record), the Created By field will be set to the User's Id. A new v.cus file is required to see this field if you are already running 8.2.</p>
<h3><span style="font-weight: bold;">2.3.5 RefTracking Tab</span></h3>
<p style="margin-left: 8px;"><span style="font-weight: bold;">C</span>licking the RefTracking tab now displays the Refrigerant Tracking history for this Equipment.</p>
<h2>2.4 Client</h2>
<p><span style="font-weight: bold;">Changed Field - &#160;Client Alpha Id:</span><br />
The Client Alpha field has been expanded to 40 characters.</p>
<h3>2.4.1 Client Collections View</h3>
<p>This release corrects a sporadic SQL Error 8152 when customers using an MSSQL database tried to access a Collections screen referencing a Check number which exceeded 20 characters (Sybase users would simply see the check numbers truncated). The Collection screen now displays correctly with the complete Check number.</p>
<p>&#160;</p>
<h1>3 AP</h1>
<h2>3.1 AP Related Registry</h2>
<h3>3.1.1 AP Check Mailer Format for Pressure Seal Checks</h3>
<p>This functionality supports a special AP Check format to support printing on pressure seal check; these checks may be folded and sealed without an envelope needed. This functionality requires registry settings since the printable area is smaller to allow for the seal; as well as registry options to define the mailer portion of the page (prints the address the check is mailed to) and to limit the number of invoices that may be listed on the stub.</p>
<p><font style="font-weight: bold;">Registry Id:</font> sys-report-rapchck</p>
<p><font style="font-weight: bold;">Setting Key:</font> useCustomMailerFormat <font style="font-weight: bold;">Setting Value:</font> true (default false)</p>

<p><font style="font-weight: bold;">Setting Key:</font> MaximumInvoicesForCheck <font style="font-weight: bold;">Setting Value:</font> 17</p>
<p>Note: this format should print correctly with the SectionPositions entry disabled; be sure to verify your settings with plain paper first.</p>
<p>The following settings are used to adjust the lines of the sections.</p>
<p><font style="font-weight: bold;">Setting Key:</font> mailerStubAdjust <font style="font-weight: bold;">Setting Value</font>: x@y where x is horizontal and y is vertical</p>

<p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">&#160;</p>
<h3>3.1.2 Purchase Order Registry for TechAnywhere</h3>
<p>The following registry setting for the Purchase Order viewer should be used to provide control over changes to POs that were generated in the field via TechAnywhere. &#160;In the absence of this setting, changes are allowed and the user is not alerted.</p>
<p>TechAnywhere has a special way of posting Purchase Orders to SAMPro that makes them different from PO's created in SAMPro. Specifically, the TechAnywhere Post sets the Job Quantity Ordered and Job Quantity Received to zero so that the parts do not import to the Work Order (double up) because TechAnywhere will post these to the Work Order when complete. Changing a TechAnywhere Purchase Order may have adverse effects by negating this special post.</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: bold;">Id:</span> sys-viewer-vprchseordrlst</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: bold;">Setting Key:</span> EditTechAnywherePOs</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: bold;">Setting Values:</span> warning &#160;OR error</p>
<p>Warning Message: "WARNING: &#160;This PO was created from TechAnywhere."</p>
<p>Error Message: "This PO was created from TechAnywhere. &#160;Changes are not allowed."</p>
<h3>3.1.3 Vendor Expiration Report Registry</h3>
<p><span style="font-weight: bold;">Id:</span> sys-report-rexprdinsrnce</p>
<p>If the autosavewhenprinted setting is enabled AND <i style="font-weight: normal;">autoemail is also set to true, &#160;</i></p>
<p style="font-style: normal;"><i style="font-style: normal;">the following line <span style="font-weight: bold;">must be added</span> for the auto-mail to occur:</i></p>
<p><b>Setting Key:</b> autoemailwhenprinted&#160;&#160;&#160;<b>Setting Value:</b> true</p>
<p>The autoemail line should be disabled so that the report is not sent twice.</p>
<h3>3.1.4 Registry To Warn / Error if Vendor Tax Does not Match Job Cost Tax</h3>
<p>In previous releases, if the calculated tax did NOT match the vendor invoice and the user adjusted the tax amount on the taxes tab the AP journal could be added/saved.&#160;However,in this case &#160;Job Cost would be incorrect, and the D/C Pass-thru did not equal zero.&#160;&#160;(Debit Expense 106.00, Credit Use Tax Payable 6.00, Debit Use Tax Payable 6.50, Credit A/P 106.50)</p>
<p>In this release, &#160;the following registry may be enabled to either warn the user that job cost tax does match the calculated Vendor Invoice tax (but allow the journal to be saved), or to error and not allow the save until the calculated and job cost tax totals match.</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: bold;">Id:</span> sys-viewer-vapjrnl</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: bold;">Setting Key:</span> ValidateTaxCost &#160;&#160;&#160;<span style="font-weight: bold;">Setting Values:</span> Warning or Error (default is neither)</p>
<p>If Warning is selected, a message will display the Tax Cost Amount on the Tax Tab, and the Tax Cost Amount in the purchase items. When the user clicks OK, the journal entry will be saved / added.</p>
<p>If Error is selected, a message will display the Tax Cost Amount on the Tax Tab, and the Tax Cost Amount in the purchase items, and instruct the user to adjust the tax cost stored in the line items to reflect the correct tax. After clicking OK, the user must adjust these values before the journal entry can be saved / added.</p>
<h3>3.1.5 Registry to Enable Pay All Invoices in Select Invoices for Payment</h3>
<p>The Select Invoices for Payment function has been enhanced to include a new 'Pay All Invoices' option. This new functionality is particularly useful for allowing the user to reset the Gross Payment and Discount to Take if it was previously cleared by voiding a check.</p>
<p>&#160;When this function is enabled via the following registry, the new Pay All Invoices button will be displayed on the Select Invoices for Payment window:</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: bold;">Registry Id:</span> sys-viewer-sapdtetopylst</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: bold;">Setting Key:</span> AllowPayAllInvoices &#160;&#160;<span style="font-weight: bold;">Setting Value:</span> true &#160;&#160;&#160;(default false)</p>
<p>When the Pay All Invoices button is clicked, the system displays a window which prompts the user to enter the Date to Pay and Discounts Date (all available Discounts due on or after the Discount Date you entered will be taken). When the user clicks OK, the Gross Amount, Discount and Retainage fields will be revised based on the dates entered, with all available Payment, Discount and Retainage amounts being completed. The user may make needed adjustments before clicking 'Go'.</p>
<h5>3.1.6 Registry To Skip Report Attachment in Start Create EOM Unvouchered AP GL Entries</h5>
<p>Based on results obtained from performance monitoring on this function, generating the Summary and Detail reports and attaching them to the GL Journal Entry results in some performance issues. &#160;The following registry allows the generation / attachment of one or both of these reports to be skipped when the function is run. These registries may be implemented if needed to improve this function's performance.</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: bold;">Registry Id:</span> sys-start-seomunvchrdap</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: bold;">Setting Key:</span> AttachSummaryDocument &#160;&#160;<span style="font-weight: bold;">Setting Value:</span> false &#160;(default is true)</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: bold;">Setting Key:</span> AttachDetailDocument &#160;&#160;<span style="font-weight: bold;">Setting Value:</span> &#160;false &#160;&#160;(default is true)</p>
<h2>3.2 AP Related Reporting</h2>
<h3>3.2.1 Report AP Check Register</h3>
<p>The five Vendor User fields have been added as range fields to this report (RAPCHEKv72b001.rpt) dated 02/15/2013.</p>
<h3>3.2.2 AP Cash Requirements Report</h3>
<p>The Invoice # column has been expanded to 20 characters. This is a system report and does not need to be imported.</p>
<h3>3.2.3 AP Checks (MICR format)</h3>
<p>Corrects a problem in recent releases where the check number in the MICR format was off one from the check number printed in the body of the check.</p>
<h3>3.2.4 AP Check Checklist</h3>
<p>Validation prevents the user from closing the Checklist (which appears after confirming the print) by clicking the Windows Red X, abandoning the check run. If the Red X is clicked, the message "This process cannot be canceled" appears.&#160;After clearing the message, the user must choose to Post, Reuse or Void the checks, and then click Go.</p>
<h3>3.2.5 Print AP Checks</h3>
<p>EFT/AFT checks now indicate Direct Deposit Advise and Void like they do in Payroll.</p>
<p>EFT Checks which skipped during the print and voided during Post AP Checks are now assigned a Check Type of EFT (was incorrectly set to Check in previous releases).</p>
<h3>3.2.6 Canadian T5018 Form</h3>
<p>Changes to support 2 vendor per page format (previous was 3 vendors per page).</p>
<h3>3.2.7 Report Unvouchered AP Summary</h3>
<p>The revised report (RUNVCHRDAP3) dated 2016-06-15 includes an ending date and fixed page header.</p>
<h2>3.3 AP Journal</h2>
<p>In this release, the GL Entity is also considered when checking for reconciled EFT/Credit Card transactions.</p>
<p>If a General line for a Work Order is added and the Equipment is manually selected, the Equipment Id will be successfully imported to the WO. Previously, the Equipment Id was only imported if it defaulted when a line was added.</p>
<p>The Add Tax button once again generates entries to the Sales Tax tab, correcting a problem introduced in 8.2.545.058. &#160;</p>
<p style="margin-left: 8px;">Corrects an issue in versions 8.1 and up which allowed PO 'Copy' lines to be deleted.</p>
<p>Previously, it was possible to overwrite a system AP Check record with a manual AP Journal Check entry because validation did not take the GL Entity into account. Validation for manual check entries considers both the Bank Account and the GL Entity to prevent this problem.</p>
<p>The Equipment specified on imported PO lines is now defaulted to the AP Journal entry. In previous releases, the Equipment defaulted from the first Equipment line on the associated Work Order.</p>
<p>The system now sets the Check GL Entity (chck.glentty_rn) correctly from the AP Journal header when posting APJ EFT and Credit/Debit Card transactions.</p>
<p>Corrects issues with intercompany reversals in previous images.</p>
<p>In previous releases, the Equipment Id could not be manually entered into AP Journal lines: it was necessary to double-click and select the line from the list. In this release, code has been added to enable the user to type in the Equipment Id following successful entry of the Work Order Id.</p>
<p>When Intercompany Processing is on, the parent security determination is based on the APJ parent GL Entity. The posting of Use Tax Liability also uses the AP parent record's security.</p>
<p>If Intercompany Processing is not enabled, the AP Journal entry and the history records it generates continue to assume the Security Id of the Purchase Order used to generate them.</p>
<h3>3.3.1 AP Journal Main Tab</h3>
<p><span style="font-weight: bold;">New Field - Use Tax Total</span><br />
This display-only field provides a running total of the Use Tax Cost entered on the Inventory, General and Subcontractor lines, excluding lines which have been copied for edit.</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: bold;">Changed Field: Discount %</span><br />
This field has been expanded from 1 to 3 decimal points (00.000) to support various Vendor discount policies.</p>
<p><font style="font-weight: bold;">Changed Field: GL Entity:<br /></font>If Intercompany Processing is implemented and if this Entity does not match the GL Entities referenced in the child tabs, the appropriate Intercompany postings to GL History will be made when this transaction is saved.</p>
<h3>3.3.2 Purchase History Tab</h3>
<p>The User Id associated to the transaction line is now displayed in the last column of this tab. This will be the user who created the PO, user who did the receipt, etc.</p>
<h3>3.3.3 Manual Check</h3>
<p>The Bank Account specified in AP Journal's&#160;AP Manual check now uses the GL Entity specified in the AP Journal header when posting.</p>
<h3>3.3.4 General Tab</h3>
<p>The Tax Type is now evaluated correctly when the Cost Category defaults from an Other Rate on a manually entered General line for a Job/WO related entry.&#160;&#160;</p>
<p><font style="font-weight: bold;">Changed Field:</font> <font style="font-weight: bold;">Revenue<br /></font>In previous releases, if a user added freight on the GEN tab of the AP Journal for a PO referenced on a COP drop ship order, the COST of that freight was picked up and invoiced on the subsequent COP invoice. With this enhancement, the system will also look at the REVENUE value entered in the AP GEN tab line, and if not zero, use it for the COP invoice. If the Revenue is zero, the system will continue to use Cost value.</p>
<h3><span style="font-weight: bold;">3.3.5 Paid Invoices / Payments Tabs</span></h3>
<p>This release corrects some display issues when column compression is not used. Note that compression is needed to display these tab perfectly.</p>
<h3>3.3.6 Multiple Inventory Receipt Journal Entry Enhancement &#160;</h3>
<p>In previous releases, the AP Journal Viewer always auto-filled its child tabs when a PO number was entered: if there were multiple Inventory Receipts Journal entries for the PO, all were loaded.</p>
<p>In this release, the system checks to see if multiple IRJ entries are present. If so, it displays a list so that the user may choose to load &#160;choose All or a specify IRJ entry. If the user chooses a specific Id, only the quantities received in that entry will be loaded.</p>
<p class="Support" style="margin-left: 48px;"><img src="MultiReceipt.bmp" alt="" style="border: none;" width="405" height="168" border="0" /></p>
<p>If multiple receipts are NOT present or receipts were only made on the PO, the selection box will not be display, and received items will be autoloaded as before.</p>
<p>Previously received IRJ transactions will NOT be removed from the list. &#160;It is hoped that this limitation will be corrected in a future version. &#160;If you select a previously selected receipt, the system will load the quantity specified on that receipt if they have not already been load. &#160;Validation prevents the AP Quantity from exceeding the quantity received in the IRJ or PO.</p>
<p>If items are received on both the PO and the IRJ for the same PO (not recommended!), All must be selected to pull in the stragglers received on the PO.</p>
<h3>3.3.5 Credit Memo Discounts</h3>
<h5>AP Journal</h5>
<p>Previously, switching the Transaction Type to Credit Memo cleared the Discount Percent and Discount Amount.&#160;&#160;The code has been revised to prompt the user before clearing the fields:" Retain AP Terms including Discount?". Note that the amount is not set if user enter Yes to this question then enters a general line.&#160;&#160;However, the user can now enter the discount amount.&#160;<br />
<br />
The user is now permitted to make manual entry into the Discount Amount field for a Credit Memo. Discounts should be entered as a positive value, and will be handled correctly by the system.</p>
<p>Credit memos with discounts 'post' properly to the Vendor Invoice table.&#160;&#160;Previously, the Invoice Amount was posting as a negative value and the Available Discount posted as a positive value.&#160;&#160;</p>
<p style="margin-left: 48px;"><span style="font-weight: bold;">Tip: AP Terms Setup</span><br />
Users should review all AP terms with discounts - such as 2%10Net30 to make sure "Compute Date-To-Pay From" is setup to be based on Discount Days instead of Due Days.&#160;&#160;This way IF the user skips running 'Select Invoice for Payment' and runs Cash Requirements/Print Checks instead, the Date to Pay will be equal to the Discount Due Date. The 'payment due date' is no longer used.</p>
<h5>Select Invoices for Payment</h5>
<p>Vendor Invoices that run through this process will have their Discount Available and Next Discount to Take values corrected.&#160;&#160;The positive values will become negative for Credit Memos for consistency with the new posting rules.</p>
<p>Validation has been added to ensure the sign on a manually entered Discount Amount is consistent with the Gross Amount.&#160;&#160;In other words, a Credit Memo can't have a positive Discount to Take value, and a Purchase can't have a negative value.</p>
<p>Calculation of the Net Payment Amount has been corrected to be consistent with the corrected APJ posting logic.</p>
<p style="font-weight: bold; margin-left: 48px;">Select Invoices for Payment Tips:<br />
<span style="font-weight: normal;">To ALWAYS take the discount enter 01011900 into the Date 'Take Discounts Due on or After this date'.</span><br />
<br />
<span style="font-weight: normal;">The user must hit GO in 'Select Invoices for Payment' to update Vendor Invoice data.&#160;&#160;The Vendor Invoice table is used to print checks.&#160;&#160;The Check Date does not determine if a discount is 'taken' or 'lost'.</span></p>
<h5><span style="font-weight: normal;">A</span>P Checks</h5>
<p>In previous releases, if Select invoices for payment was NOT run, the discount was disregarded and the full credit memo taken. In this release, the Discount specified on the AP Journal is taken.</p>
<h2>3.4 Vendor Viewer &#160;</h2>
<h3>3.4.1 Vendor User Fields</h3>
<p>The five Vendor User fields have been added as range fields for the following functions:</p>
<p style="margin-left: 36.00pt;">AP Journal viewer<br />
Select Invoices for Payment (Date-to-Pay List)<br />
AP Cash Requirements List<br />
Print AP Checks<br />
Print AP Manual Checks (Single-write Check Printing)<br />
View Vendor Invoices viewer<br />
Start AP Payment Approved List<br />
Start AP Payment Approved List PM</p>
<h3>3.4.2 Vendor Main Tab</h3>
<p><span style="font-weight: bold;">Vendor Alpha Id:</span><br />
The Vendor Alpha field has been expanded to 40 characters.</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: bold;">IMPORTANT NOTE - Main Tab - GL Entity</span><br />
In Version 8.2, this field is also used to set the GL Entity for manual checks, EFT and CC/DR Card transactions when posting to a Bank Account. In previous releases, it was only used to assign an Entity to the AP Control Account and Discounts Earned. Because of this change:</p>
<p style="margin-left: 48px;">If InterCompany IS enabled, this field should be set to a Corporate GL Entity for the company.</p>
<p style="margin-left: 48px;"><span style="font-weight: normal;">If InterCompany is NOT enabled, this field should remain blank for manual checks, EFT and CC transactions to avoid Bank Reconciliation issues. &#160;</span></p>
<h3>3.4.2 Vendor Defaults Tab</h3>
<p><font style="font-weight: bold;">Two new fields, EFT Bank Id and EFT Account Number have been added to this tab to support Electronic/Automated Funds Transfer (AFT for Canada, EFT for US).</font> If the AP EFT functionality is NOT implemented, you may wish to disable these fields via registry to prevent users from inadvertently entering data and triggering the EFT functionality.</p>
<p style="margin-left: 48px;">Registry Id: sys-viewer-vvndr</p>
<p style="margin-left: 48px;">Setting Key: disabledFieldsParent &#160;Setting Value: vndr.eft-bnk-id-frmttd,vndr.eft-accnt-nmbr</p>
<h2>3.5 Clear Checks</h2>
<p>This release corrects a “Runtime Error: illegal character in format” that occurred if the user attempted to clear a credit memo EFT or Credit Card entry what result in a negative ‘check’ amount. In this release, both positive and negative EFT's and Credit card entries will clear.</p>
<h2>3.6 Start Create EOM Unvouchered AP GL</h2>
<p>Internal changes in this release improve the performance of creating the View Summary and View Detail reports. If these reports were disabled via registry (see Release Note 3.1.6) you may be able to turn them back on in Version 8.2.545.080 and up.</p>
<p>This release eliminates spurious warnings that this function was being run a second time.</p>
<h2>3.7 AP Terms</h2>
<p><span style="font-weight: bold;">Changed Field: Discount %</span><br />
This field has been expanded from 1 to 3 decimal points &#160;(00.000) to support various Vendor discount policies.</p>
<p><font style="font-weight: bold;">New Field - Obsolete?<br /></font>If this field is checked, the record is considered Obsolete, and it may not be directly specified during data-entry (either by entering the Id or selecting it from a list). Obsoleted records can be edited and the Obsolete option can be cleared when necessary. When you check the Obsolete field, the following message box will be displayed:</p>
<p style="margin-left: 36.00pt;">“You have elected to obsolete this record. Would you like to see existing references to this record?”</p>
<p style="margin-left: 48px;">If you click Yes, the system will display a viewer that provides click-through access to all tables referencing this record.</p>
<h2>3.8 Accounts Payable EFT (Electronic Funds Transfer) Support</h2>
<p>This enhancement implements the electronic funds transfer of AP checks for our US customers to US banks. This option also supports a 'Skip Print' option registry to avoid wasting physical checks on EFT transactions.</p>
<p>To implement this functionality:</p>
<ol style="list-style: decimal;">
<li>
<p>Your firm must arrange with a bank or other originator to provide this functionality.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Import Report EFT AP Check Detail Vendor (REFTCHCKDTLVNDR.rpt) &#160;and Report EFT AP Detail (REFTCHCKDTL.rpt) into your database.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Complete the required registry entries for your Vendor records (Customer Release Note 3.8.2), Report EFT AP (3.8.4), and Print AP Checks (3.8.6) and Report EFT AP Check Detail Vendor (3.8.9).</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>For the Vendors that wish to be paid via EFT, complete the EFT Bank Id, EFT Account Number, and Email address in their Vendor record. &#160;Note that this is the trigger for the system to generate an EFT rather than a physical check.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Print and post AP Checks and EFT's; if Print Skip is implemented, EFT's will appear on the screen but will not be output to the printer.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Run EFT Accounts Payable to generate the EFT (Electronic File Transfer) AP file that will be transmitted for direct deposits. It will also create a printed EFT report for your records. After printing the report, you will be asked to confirm that an electronic file should be created.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Upload the EFT file to your bank as they specify.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Run Report EFT AP Check Detail Vendor to automatically e-mail to your vendors, alerting them that they been paid.</p>
</li>
</ol>
<h3>3.8.1 Vendor Viewer</h3>

<p><font style="font-weight: bold;">Setting Value:</font> Contact1 (only look in the Vendor Contact 1 field)</p>
<p>Or a list of 1-3 of the Email fields, in the order they should be used.</p>
<h3>3.8.3 Report EFT Accounts Payable</h3>
<p style="font-weight: bold;">Purpose:</p>
<p>The Report EFT AP function should be run <font style="font-weight: bold;">after</font> the Print AP Checks function has been completed. This function is designed to generate the EFT (Electronic File Transfer) AP file that will be transmitted for direct deposits. It will also create a printed EFT report for your records. After printing the report, you will be asked to confirm that an electronic file should be created.</p>
<p style="font-weight: bold;">Usage:</p>
<p>A registry entry (see release note 3.8.4 below) must be in place for each GL Account/GL Entity combination for which you intend to create direct deposit files. In addition, the EFT Bank Id and Account fields must be completed in the Vendor records.</p>
<p><font style="font-weight: bold;">Start Date: End Date:</font><br />
Defines the date range for effective check dates to be included in the file.</p>
<p><font style="font-weight: bold;">GL Account Id:</font><br />
(Required.) The bank (cash) account on which these AP checks are drawn. Double-click on this field to select from a list of Id's.</p>

<p>This may be included if your bank/financial institution explicitly instructs you that all text must be uppercase.</p>
<h3>3.9.4a &#160;Registry Entries for Check Values Exceeding $20,000</h3>
<p>The following changes were made to support the alternate, higher security submission mechanism rules implemented by the Royal Bank of Canada for payments larger than $20,000.00.</p>
<p>If any AP AFT checks will be generated in the amount of $20,000, the &#160;RBC header line in the output file must be disabled through the following registry entries (note that all Setting Values are empty). &#160;This is done through the following options for sys-aftap<font style="font-style: italic;">-glbankaccountid</font>- registry entries:</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: bold;">Setting Key:</span> Format &#160;&#160;&#160;<span style="font-weight: bold;">Setting Value:</span><br />
<span style="font-weight: bold;">Setting Key:</span> TestFileHeader &#160;&#160;<span style="font-weight: bold;">Setting Value:</span><br />
<span style="font-weight: bold;">Setting Key:</span> ProdFileHeader &#160;&#160;<span style="font-weight: bold;">Setting Value:</span></p>
<p>This format is also acceptable for lower dollar amount AP AFT checks.</p>
<p>'C' Lines Characters 194-202 must also be filled with '000000000' via the following option:</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: bold;">Setting Key:</span> edIDReturns &#160;&#160;<span style="font-weight: bold;">Setting Value:</span> 000000000</p>
<p>The following programmatic changes in this version also support the higher security submission mechanism rules as well as the submission of lower dollar payments:</p>
<p style="margin-left: 48px;">'C' Lines Characters 254-264 are filled with blanks.<br />
'Z' Lines Characters 69-1464 are filled with zeros.</p>
<h3>3.9.5 Print AP Checks</h3>
<p style="font-weight: bold;">Changed Fields:</p>
<p><font style="font-weight: bold;">EFT Trx #:<br /></font>This display-only field lists the next EFT transaction number available for the GL Account / GL Entity combination. When the checks have been printed, a message will appear indicating that EFT Transactions were processed.</p>
<p>EFT’s will appear on the Post/Void checklist.</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: bold;">NOTE:</span> If only electronic checks are included in a run and there appears to be nothing to print, you still must complete the Print operation in order to process the EFT's.</p>
<h3>3.9.6 Registry for Print AP Checks</h3>
<p style="font-weight: bold;">Skip Print AP Checks EFT's</p>
<p>This enhancement allows AP EFT type checks to be shown on the screen but not be output to the printer. <span id="BugEvents35111">The following settings are now available for registry entry sys-report-rapchck.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: bold;">Id:</span> <span>sys-report-rapchck</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: bold;">Setting Key:</span> <span>SkipPrintEFTChecks &#160;&#160;</span><span style="font-weight: bold;">Setting Value:</span> <span>true</span></p>
<p><span>When implemented, this option allows for the display of AP EFT Checks, but the actual print of AP EFT Checks is skipped. &#160;AP EFT Checks which will be skipped will use a new numbering sequence beginning with 9000000000 for each GL Bank &amp; GL Entity combination.</span></p>
<h3>3.9.7 Report EFT AP Detail</h3>
<p>This user report (REFTCHCKDTL.rpt) must be imported into your database if it has not already been installed. <span style="text-indent: 30.25pt;">It may be run &#160;to review previous transactions.</span>&#160;This report is valid for EFT (US) and AFT (Canadian) users.</p>

<h3>3.9.9 Registry for Report EFT AP Check Detail Vendor</h3>
<p>This new report has functionality for autosave, autoemail &amp; emailby section logic. This report is valid for EFT (US) and AFT (Canadian) users. The following setting keys may be applicable:</p>

<h2>3.10 Select Invoices for Payment / AP Checks</h2>
<p>This version corrects problems associated with changing Vendor Invoice Numbers on AP Journal entries which could result in the incorrect amounts appearing AP Check. This scenario could occur if someone had Select Invoices for Payment sitting open &#160;WHILE the AP Journal entry was being changed. &#160;In this release, the Select Invoices for Payment function skips the update if the Vendor Invoice 'original' Invoice Amount / Id has changed while it is executing.</p>
<h3>3.10.1 Pay All Invoices Option</h3>
<p><img src="SKIN1_PayAllInvoices.bmp" alt="" style="border: none;" border="0" /> The Select Invoices for Payment/AP Date to Pay function has been enhanced to include a new 'Pay All Invoices' button. This new functionality is particularly useful for allowing the user to reset the Gross Payment and Discount to Take if it was previously cleared by voiding a check. This functionality is &#160;enabled via the registry defined in Customer Release Note 3.1.5.</p>
<p>When the Pay All Invoices button is clicked, a window prompts the user to enter the Date to Pay and Discounts Date. When the user clicks OK, the Gross Amount, Discount and Retainage fields will be revised based on the dates entered. The user may make needed adjustments before clicking 'Go'.</p>
<h2>3.11 &#160;Recurring AP Journal</h2>
<h3>3.11.1 GL Tab</h3>
<p><span style="font-weight: bold;">Change Field: GL Entity</span><br />
If a GL Entity is specified, it will be used on the AP Journal's Taxes tab when the Recurring AP is released. &#160;If a GL Entity is not specified, the GL Entity specified in the applicable Sale Tax Authority record(s) will be written to the AP Journal's Taxes tab when the Recurring AP is released.</p>
<h1>4 Purchasing</h1>
<h2>4.1 Registry</h2>
<h3>4.1.1 Default PO Sales Tax Group from Job &#160;</h3>
<p>By default, the PO Tax Group defaults from the Vendor record if the Vendor record has a Tax Group. Since this does not produce the desired result in all cases, this release implements a new setting that sets the PO parent Tax Group based on the Job's Tax Group.&#160;&#160;The job can be entered directly in the PO parent or it can be determined from the WO entered directly in the PO.</p>
<p>This setting causes the PO parent Sales Tax Group to be set from the Job record.&#160;&#160;This can be either the Job entered directly in the PO parent record or it can be the Job from Work Order entered directly in the PO parent record.</p>
<p><font style="font-weight: bold;">Registry Id:</font> sys-viewer-vprchseordrlst &#160;</p>
<p><font style="font-weight: bold;">Setting Key:</font> DefaultPOTaxGroupFromJob &#160;<font style="font-weight: bold;">Setting Value:</font> true (default is false)</p>
<h3>4.1.2 Reorder Advice Registry Option to show Site Name</h3>
<p>You have the option of showing the Site Name for work orders, client orders, purchase orders and/or shop orders. The Site is derived from work order, job and/or client order as needed.</p>
<p><font style="font-weight: bold;">Id:</font> sys-report-rrordradvce</p>
<p><font style="font-weight: bold;">Setting Key:</font> ShowSiteInfo</p>
<p><font style="font-weight: bold;">Setting Value:</font> WorkOrder,ClientOrder,PurchaseOrder,ShopOrder</p>
<p>You may specify as many of the above values as needed.</p>
<h3>4.1.3 Credit PO’s must be Received in AP Journal</h3>
<p>By default, unreceived PO lines for regular PO's may not be vouchered, but credit PO lines can be vouchered even if they aren't received. A new registry option has been added to prevent unreceived credit PO lines from being vouchered. To invoke this new behavior the user must add following option:</p>
<p><font style="font-weight: bold;">Registry Id:</font> sys-viewer-vapjrnl</p>
<p><font style="font-weight: bold;">Setting Key:</font> CreditPOsMustBeReceived <font style="font-weight: bold;">Setting Value:</font> true</p>
<h3>4.1.4 Set Cost from Standard</h3>
<p>When a PO is created, an Inventory Item's cost defaults from the Inventory Item's Vendor tab. The following registry setting overrides this behavior and instead uses the Item’s Standard Cost. If the Standard Cost is not completed, the Last Cost is used.</p>
<p><font style="font-weight: bold;">Setting Key:</font> useStandardCostFirst <font style="font-weight: bold;">Setting Value:</font> true (default is false)</p>
<h3>4.1.5 Registry To Prevent PO Print Confirmation</h3>
<p>Answering ‘yes’ the PO Print confirmation results in the system setting the status of the PO to Printed. This prevents the cancellation of any PO line unless the PO status is first set to Pending Cancel and printed again. This entry prevents the confirmation prompt from appearing.&#160;&#160;In other words, it treats the print as though the user answered NO without actually prompting for their response.</p>
<p><font style="font-weight: bold;">Registry Id:</font> sys-report-rpofrm</p>
<p><font style="font-weight: bold;">Setting Key:</font> PrintConfirmationDisabled <font style="font-weight: bold;">Setting Value:</font> true</p>
<p style="margin-left: 36.00pt;"><font style="font-weight: bold;">Important Archiving Note:</font> <font style="font-weight: bold;"><br /></font>If the above registry option is enabled, the autosavewhenprinted registry option will NOT work because the user never confirms the print. The autosave option should be used instead if the archiving of this report is desired.</p>
<p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">&#160;</p>
<h2>4.2 Purchasing Reports</h2>
<h3>4.2.1 Report PO Reorder Advice Report</h3>
<p>The Inventory Group Id has been added to Inventory Item Description lines of this report.</p>
<p><font style="font-weight: bold;">New Option: Sort By Inventory Group Id<br /></font>If this new option is selected, the report will be sorted by Vendor Id, then by Inventory Group id, and finally by Inventory Item Id.</p>
<p>Added range fields for Vendor Id and Equipment Type Id fields.</p>
<p><font style="font-weight: bold;">New Field</font> <font style="font-weight: bold;">- Restrict to Location</font> <font style="font-weight: bold;">Filter</font> <font style="font-weight: bold;">Only?<br /></font>If you check this field the items on this report will be restricted to those needed at locations defined by the Location Id: range. Other stock locations that have the item available for possible transfer will NOT appear on the report if this box is checked.</p>
<p>Note that this is a system report and does NOT need to be imported into your database.</p>
<p>This report may now be run from the Scheduled Report Manager with the "Add Option to Only Show Locations Selected in Location Range Field" option checked.</p>
<h3>4.2.2 Report Vendor Invoice</h3>
<p>The revised Report Vendor Invoice-CSV (RVNDRINVCE-CSV.rpt) dated 7/19/2013 corrects a sporadic “Unable to Insert Into Temp Table #vndrinvce1” error.</p>
<h3>4.2.3 Report PO Form</h3>
<p>The PO printing confirmation message has been changed so that it is more descriptive of what it really means. Answering yes to the question "Did PO's Print Successfully?" resulted in the system setting the status of the PO to Printed. This prevents the cancellation of any PO line unless the PO status is first set to Pending Cancel and printed again.</p>
<p>In this release, the confirmation message has been changed to: “Would you like to make this PO a controlled document? Specifying "Yes" may require any changes or cancellations on this PO to be made on a change order.”</p>
<p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">&#160;</p>
<h2>4.3 Purchase Order Viewer</h2>
<p style="margin-left: 8px;">Corrects the posting of credit POs costed to Work Orders/Jobs to Inventory History. &#160;</p>
<p>Previously, the system disallowed changing the Vendor on PO's generated from a Quote.&#160;This restriction has been relaxed so that the Vendor can be changed if no receipts have been performed on the PO and it is NOT a Subcontractor PO.&#160;&#160;</p>
<p>This version eliminates spurious PO Tab Mismatch messages related to the new TechAnywhere PO logic implemented via registry (Customer Note 17.1.5) .</p>
<p>In previous releases, Job Revenue was not calculated when the Cost was zero. Now the Revenue is computed (even if the Cost is zero) for unit price Inventory and General lines when the Job Quantity Received is not zero.</p>
<p>The system no longer triggers Change Order logic for POs with 8-character or above Id's to avoid exceeding the size of the PO Id field. The user is informed if Change Order cannot be created due to the size of the Id.</p>
<p>Validation prevents received lines on COP Dropship Purchase Orders from being deleted after they have been received even if the PO has not been printed.</p>
<p>In previous releases, the Equipment Id could not be manually entered into PO lines: it was necessary to double-click and select the line from the list. In this release, the user may enter the Equipment Id following successful entry of the Work Order Id.</p>
<p>The PO viewer now allows Inventory and Job quantities to be different when the PO parent has a Tax Group as long as the Inventory line has the same Tax Group.</p>
<h3>4.3.1 Status Tab</h3>
<p><font style="font-weight: bold;">New Field: GL Entity Id<br /></font>This field defaults from the Location record. It is required if Intercompany Processing is enabled.</p>
<h3>4.3.2 Inventory Tab</h3>
<p>TechAnywhere-generated Purchase Orders no longer default the Job Quantity Ordered/Received when the Quantity Ordered/Received is changed to prevent double-costing.</p>
<p>If the WO/Job Id is entered after the Inventory Item Id, the Cost Category (if blank) now defaults from the Inventory Item's Group.</p>
<p>The Work Order information from the PO Header is not defaulted to the Inventory Tab until a Quantity is entered, correcting a problem if you <font style="text-decoration: underline;">manually</font> entered the WO Id in the PO header.</p>
<p><font style="font-weight: bold;">Changed Field: Inventory Id:<br /></font>The system now checks to see if a part has been superceded (the Superceded By field on the Inventory Other Tab is filled in). When a superseded part number is entered into this field, the system will alert the user that</p>
<p style="margin-left: 36.00pt;">Item A has been superceded by Item B. Use New Item?</p>
<p>It the user clicks Yes, the new part (B) will be returned to the field. If the user clicks No, part A (which has been superceded) will remain in the field.</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: bold;">Changed Field: Use Tax</span><br />
Use Tax is now recalculated when the Inventory Item Id is changed. Previously, it was set when the Item was first entered, and when its quantity or cost was changed. &#160;&#160;</p>
<h3>4.3.3 GLH Tab</h3>
<p>The Vendor Invoice No has been added to the Purchase Order viewer's GLH tab. This release corrects formatting of the Credit and Invoice No. columns.</p>
<h3><span style="font-weight: bold;">4.3.4 IMH Tab</span></h3>
<p>The Inventory Item Id is now included in the Description field (ItemId~Description) to avoid confusion if a General and Inventory Item have the same Description.</p>
<h3>4.3.5 Scan Button</h3>
<p><img src="image/SKIN1_ScanDocuments.gif" alt="" style="border: none;" border="0" /> This new sidebar button supports special processing to automatically attach the scanned document to records related to the PO: Vendor, Job (all jobs referenced on any child row) and Work Order (all work orders referenced on any child row) as applicable.</p>
<h3>4.3.6 &#160;Equipment Flagged Deny TA Access?</h3>
<p>If a SAMPro user creates a purchase order for a TechAnywhere Tech work order, they may inadvertently pick equipment that is flagged Deny TA Access. In this case, the parts from the purchase order will never come into TechAnywhere and the tech ends up manually entering the parts again and double costing the job. &#160;The system now displays a warning when adding lines to a purchase order when the equipment chosen has the Deny TA Access? flag checked.</p>
<h3>4.3.7 <span style="font-weight: bold;">Subcontractor Tab</span>&#160;</h3>
<p>Use Tax is now recalculated when the Amount fields are changed.<br /></p>
<h2>4.4 Start Generate POs</h2>
<p><span style="font-weight: bold;">Important Note:</span> Inventory Items that are flagged as Inactive or Obsolete, or have been Superceded are now excluded from this function.</p>
<h3>4.4.1 New Fields on List/Edit Screen</h3>
<p style="font-weight: bold;">Promise Date:<br />
<span style="font-weight: normal;">The user may complete this field; it will be written to the Purchase Order.</span></p>
<p><font style="font-weight: bold;">LTB Vendor Id: LTB Date:<br />
Last Time Bought Vendor Name:<br /></font>These fields display the Last Time Bought information for this Location/Item.</p>
<h3>4.4.1a New Field on Range Screen</h3>
<p><span style="font-weight: bold;">New Range: Stocked</span><br />
To limit this function to Items flagged as Stocked, enter a Y in this range. &#160;If this range is blank, the Stocked flag will be ignored when this function is run.</p>
<h3>4.4.2 New Functionality to Print the Purchase Orders</h3>
<p>When you click Go to generate the Purchase Orders, the system will display a message box confirming the number of Purchase Orders generated, and ask “Print PO Forms?”</p>
<p>Click ‘Yes’ to launch the PO report pre-filtered to the POs generated, or ‘No’ to simply acknowledged the message.</p>
<p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">&#160;</p>
<h2>4.5 Start Close Open POs</h2>
<h3>Purpose:</h3>
<p>This is a new starter-type function.&#160;&#160;Its purpose is to close Purchase Orders that are either NOT fully received or NOT fully vouchered and are never expected to be.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes;">&#160;</span>&#160;This is accomplished by resetting individual PO Line quantities (Ordered and Received) to match line Vouchered Quantities.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes;">&#160;</span>&#160;Once its ‘open’ lines have been ‘cancelled’, the PO can be closed by this function.</p>
<h3>Usage:</h3>
<p>Permission to run this function should be limited as its inappropriate use can cause irreparable damage to your Purchasing system. The user will be warned of this each time the function is initiated.</p>
<h3>Important Fields: Range View</h3>
<p><span style="text-indent: -.25in; mso-bidi-font-weight: normal; mso-list: l1 level1 lfo1;"><b>Date Opened Cutoff:</b></span><br />
<span style="text-indent: -.25in;">The Date Opened Cutoff is used to select POs that are eligible to close.&#160;&#160;A PO’s Date Entered must be on or before the Date Opened Cutoff to be considered.</span></p>
<p><span style="text-indent: -.25in; font-weight: bold;">Date Closed:</span><br />
Each PO closed by this process will have its Date Closed set to the value entered in this field. This date must be part of an Active Accounting Period.&#160;&#160;Currently there is no validation logic for this so it’s the user’s responsibility to pick an appropriate date.</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: bold;">Include Credit POs?<br />
Include TA POs?</span><br />
The <b style="mso-bidi-font-weight: normal;">Include Credits POs</b> and <b style="mso-bidi-font-weight: normal;">Include TA POs</b> options are not currently available. Credit PO's and PO's generated from TechAnywhere are excluded from this function.</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: bold;">Range Fields:</span><br />
Several range-type fields (Vendor Id, Vendor Name, etc.) are available to be used as needed. &#160;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: bold;">PO Id:</span><br />
By default, the PO Id Range is filled in with the characters 'XXX'. The user must explicitly complete this field with a PO Id or clear it. &#160;</p>
<p><img src="image/SKIN1_Go.gif" alt="" style="border: none;" border="0" /> Each PO meeting the above criteria is considered when the Go button is clicked. SAMPro will generate a checklist of PO's to be selected for closure.</p>
<h3><span style="font-weight: bold;">Important Fields: Checklist</span></h3>
<p>POs having one or more ‘open’ lines are displayed in a check list viewer showing information about each qualifying PO.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes;">&#160;</span>&#160;Individual lines can be selected or de-selected.</p>
<p style="font-weight: bold;">PO Id: - Vendor Id - Lines to Close - Job Id and Name - AR Invoice Id:<br />
WO Id: - Total Job Cost - Client Id and Name - AP Journal Id:</p>
<p><img src="image/SKIN1_Go.gif" alt="" style="border: none;" border="0" /> &#160;When GO is clicked on the Checklist, each selected PO is processed as follows: <span style="mso-spacerun: yes;">&#160;</span></p>
<p style="margin-left: 36px;">Set the PO’s Date Released equal to the <b style="mso-bidi-font-weight: normal;">Date Closed</b> input option value.</p>
<p style="mso-list: l0 level1 lfo2; margin-left: 36px;">Reset the Accounting Period to one that includes the new Date Released.</p>
<p style="mso-list: l0 level1 lfo2; margin-left: 36px;">Set the Quantity Received and Quantity Ordered equal to the Quantity Vouchered on each child line.</p>
<p style="mso-list: l0 level1 lfo2; margin-left: 36px;">Delete all child lines with new Quantity Ordered equal to zero.</p>
<p style="mso-list: l0 level1 lfo2; margin-left: 36px;">If all child lines have been ‘closed’, set the PO’s Date Closed, Received-in-Full and Vouchered-in-Full fields.</p>
<p style="mso-list: l0 level1 lfo2; margin-left: 36px;">Save the changed PO.</p>
<p style="mso-list: l0 level1 lfo2; margin-left: 36px;">Update all new JCH rows and set the jchstry.jchstry_dscrptn equal to ‘*** PO LINES CANCELLED ***’.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes;">&#160;</span>&#160;To avoid creating new unbilled costs, set jchstry.jchstry_rfrnce_ar_invce_id equal to the AR Invoice Id shown in the check list viewer.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes;">&#160;</span>&#160;The Invoice Id is the most recent posted invoice for the PO’s Work Order and Job.</p>
<p style="mso-list: l0 level1 lfo2; margin-left: 36px;"><span style="mso-list: l0 level1 lfo2; text-indent: -.25in;">Update all new IMH rows and set the imhstry.imhstry_dscrptn equal to ‘*** PO LINES CANCELLED ***’.</span></p>

<h3>5.1.1 Inventory Adjustments Journal - Create Serialized Item</h3>
<p>This enhancement enables the entry of new Serialized Items in the Inventory Adjustments Journal. A registry entry is required to enable this functionality:</p>
<p><font style="font-weight: bold;">Registry Id:</font> sys-viewer-vinvntryadjstmnt</p>
<p><font style="font-weight: bold;">Setting Key:</font> CreateNewSerialNumber Setting Value: true (default is false)</p>
<p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">&#160;</p>
<p>To ‘create’ a new serialized item in the Inventory Adjustments Journal:</p>
<p style="margin-left: 36.00pt;">Enter the Period Id and Effective Date, and set the Entry Type to ‘Adjustment’.</p>
<p style="margin-left: 36.00pt;">Enter the Inventory Item Id the serialized item.</p>
<p style="margin-left: 36.00pt;">Enter the new Serial Number: when you tab out of the field the system will prompt that the serial number does not exist, click Yes to create it.</p>
<p style="margin-left: 36.00pt;">Enter a Quantity of 1 and the appropriate Unit Cost.</p>
<p style="margin-left: 36.00pt;">Select the ‘To’ Location (on the bottom line) where you want the new Serial item to be created.</p>
<p>When you save the journal entry, the new item will be available at that Location.</p>
<h3>5.1.2 Inventory Item Pricing Label</h3>
<p>The new standard WinII (and all customizations deriving from it) supports optional labels for Inventory Item Price Levels on the Inventory Item Pricing/Costing tab. The labels will appear to the right of the fields. The following registry entry allows each of the 9 Price Levels to be labeled.</p>
<p>Registry Id: sys-viewer-vinvntryitm</p>
<p>Setting Key: LabelPriceLevel1 Setting Value: labeltext1</p>
<p>Setting Key: LabelPriceLevel2 Setting Value: labeltext2</p>
<p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">…..&#160;</p>
<p>Keys for LabelPriceLevel1-9 should be specified. The Setting Value fields specify the Labels and should not exceed 30 characters. Tip: if your firm does not use all price levels, you wish to use this registry to label such levels 'Do Not Use'.</p>
<h3>5.1.3 Registry to Set Inactive Flag on Superceded Parts</h3>
<p><span id="BugEvents31">By default, the Inactive flag is not automatically set on a superceded Inventory Item. &#160;Since some users prefer to make superceded items Inactive, the following registry is now available.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: bold;">Id:</span> <span>sys-viewer-vinvntryitm</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: bold;">Setting Key:</span> <span>MakeSupercededPartsInactive &#160;</span><span style="font-weight: bold;">Setting Value:</span> <span>true &#160;(default is false)</span></p>
<p><span>Note that if this registry entry is set, the user will be warned that the superceded part will be flagged as Inactive. In addition, if a string of parts points to the one most recently superceded, they will also be flagged as Inactive, and their Superceded By field set to the new superceding part.</span></p>
<h3><span>5.1.4 &#160;Default</span> Quantity Billable in Return to Inventory &#160;and Fill Lines Wizards</h3>
<p>If an Inventory Adjustment is generated as a result of running the Work Order's Return to Inventory Wizard or the Inventory Adjustment's Fill in Lines Wizard, the Quantity Billable will only default from the Quantity if the following registry entry is enabled.</p>
<p>If this registry is enabled, when you import costs in the Work Order that were generated via this function, the line will specify a negative quantity AND a negative billable quantity. If this registry entry is not set, the billable quality will be zero when it is imported. &#160;In either case, the user may adjust the billable quantity on the imported line. <span style="font-weight: bold;">&#160;</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: bold;">Registry Id:</span> sys-viewer-vinvntryadjstmnt</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: bold;">Setting Key:</span> QtyBillableEqualsQtyReturned &#160;&#160;<span style="font-weight: bold;">Setting Value:</span> true</p>
<h2>5.2 Reports</h2>
<h3>5.2.1 Report Inventory Count Report (RINVNTRYCNT.rpt)</h3>
<p class="MsoNormal">This revised report (dated 06/03/2014) correctly processes the End Date field on the input screen when computing the Quantity on Hand as of that Date.</p>
<h3>5.2.2 Report Inventory Cost On-Hand</h3>
<p>The Report Inventory Cost On-Hand (RINVCST.rpt) has been revised as of 12/02/2014 to improve the printing of the Inventory Total lines. &#160;This report should be used to display costing per location for the method specified in the report. The Stock Status Report should only be used to provide average costing over all locations.</p>
<h3><span style="font-weight: bold;">5.2.3 &#160;Report Inventory Audit (RINVNTRYADT.rpt)</span></h3>
<p style="margin-left: 8px;">The revised report dated 2015/05/22 has been modified to remove detail lines which have zero quantity and zero cost.</p>
<h2>5.3 Superseding Parts</h2>
<p>Note: In this release, completing the Superceded By field in the Inventory Item record no longer automatically sets the Item’s Inactive flag. See Customer Release Note 5.1.3 for a registry entry to set Superceded items to Inactive.</p>
<p>This enhancement allows users to designate existing inventory part records as being “superseded” by another existing inventory part record. When a superseded part number is entered into the inventory item id field of the Work Order Inventory lines, Work Order Required Resources lines, Purchase Order Inventory lines, Flat Rate Category Inventory lines, COP Order Entry lines or Quote Master Inventory lines the system will alert the user that</p>
<p style="margin-left: 36.00pt;">Item A has been superceded by Item B. Use New Item?</p>
<p>It the user clicks Yes, the new part (B) will be returned to the field. If the user clicks No, part A (which has been superceded) will remain in the field.</p>
<p><font style="font-weight: bold;">Inventory Item Other Tab New Field: Superceded By:<br /></font>This field should only be completed if the current Inventory Item record you are in has been superceded by the item you specify in this field. Superceded parts CANNOT be flagged as Obsolete.</p>
<p>Note that a string of superseded parts can be created that will result in the latest part number being returned to the data entry screen. For example, Part A could be superseded by Part B which could be superseded by Part C. If the user were to type in Part A, Part C would be returned if he elected to use the new item.</p>
<p style="font-weight: bold;">New Inventory Item Tab: Supercedes</p>
<p>This display-only tab lists the parts that the selected Inventory Item supercedes.</p>
<h2>5.4 Inventory Adjustment Journal</h2>
<p style="margin-left: 8px;">This function now posts the WO reference (when available) to Inventory History for Job-Location and Location-Job entries for informational purposes.</p>
<p style="margin-left: 8px;">This release corrects the spurious 'changes to this record are not allowed' message when the Return to Inventory Wizard is run.</p>
<p style="margin-left: 8px;">If Intercompany security is enabled, the appropriate Security Id is now included on history entries posted to Job, Tax and Inventory History from manual and Wizard entries. &#160;</p>
<p style="margin-left: 8px;">Previously, the GL Account debited for Loc-to-Job / credited for Job-to-Loc entries was set from the Inventory Group's Expense Account, not the Job Cost Category's Expense Account. In this release, the Expense Account in the Job Cost Category overrides the Inventory Group's Expense Account for both Manual and Wizard generated entries.</p>
<p style="margin-left: 8px;">Refines the calculation of the Unit Cost on the Return to Inventory wizard to make a more accurate cost entry from the source work order/job.</p>
<p>Entries generated by the Work Order's Return To Inventory button will now have their Description set to “Return from Work Order ######”.</p>
<p>The Inventory Adjustments Journal and Tech Material Pickup now default the overall item last cost if the location-specific cost is zero. &#160;This corrects an issue encountered with Tech Material Pickup when the cost at the Staging location was zero for a particular item.</p>
<p>This Journal may now be used to ‘create’ serialized items. See Customer Release Note 5.1.1 for the required registry entry and instructions on how to create the serialized item.</p>
<h3>5.4.1 New Work Order Functionality</h3>
<p><font style="font-weight: bold;">New Field</font> <font style="font-weight: bold;">in From/Adjust and To Lines</font> <font style="font-weight: bold;">-</font> <font style="font-weight: bold;">Work Order Id:<br /></font>This field allows the transfer of inventory:</p>
<p style="margin-left: 36.00pt;">From a Location to a Work Order (Transaction Type Loc-to-Job)</p>
<p style="margin-left: 36.00pt;">From a Work Order to Work Order (Transaction Type Job-to-Job)</p>
<p style="margin-left: 36.00pt;">From a Work Order to a Location (Transaction Type Job-to-Loc)</p>
<p>When the Inventory Adjustment transaction is saved, it will be written to Job History. In the Work Order, the Get Costs button allows the user to import these transactions into the Work Order, and make any desired changes to the Quantity Billed (currently not set by this function).</p>
<p><font style="font-weight: bold;">New Field</font> <font style="font-weight: bold;">in From/Adjust and To Lines</font> <font style="font-weight: bold;">-</font> <font style="font-weight: bold;">Equipment Id:<br /></font>You must click the Magnify button to see this field. The Equipment Id from the Work Order will default, but may be changed by the user.</p>
<h3>5.4.1a Revenue Fields Added to the Inventory Adjustments Journal</h3>
<p>Click the Magnify Button to see the following new fields.</p>
<p style="font-weight: bold;">From/Adjust New Fields added:</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: bold;">Quantity Billable:<br /></span>This field defaults from the Quantity field, and will be used to update Job History if a Work Order or Job is being impacted. It may be cleared by the user.</p>
<p>For example, if the Transaction Type is Job to Location, and you have specified a Work Order, when you import costs in the Work Order, the item will appear as a negative quantity AND a negative billable quantity even though the quantities are entered as positive values in this journal.</p>
<p>If this transaction was generated as a result of running the Work Order's Inventory Return Wizard, the Quantity Billable will only default from the Quantity if the registry entry discussed below is enabled.</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: bold;">Extra:<br /></span>This field should be flagged if the item should be flagged as an Extra for Allow Extra Billing Items.</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: bold;">Billing Rate Id:<br /></span>This field will default to markup a Job or Work Order is specified and the Inventory Item is NOT flagged as Use Unit Prices. &#160;If a Job or Work Order is specified and the Inventory Item is flagged as Use Unit Prices, this field defaults to unit price. &#160;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: bold;">Revenue Rate:</span><br />
If a Job or Work Order is specified and the Inventory Item is flagged as Use Unit Prices, this field defaults to the Unit Price associated with the Price Level specified in the Job. &#160;If the item is not flagged as Use Unit Prices, the Revenue Rate will be set according the Material Markup specified in the Job/WO's Rate Schedule. &#160;</p>
<p style="font-weight: bold;">Unit Price:<br />
<span style="font-weight: normal;">If a Job or Work Order is specified and the Inventory Item is flagged as Use Unit Prices, this field defaults to the Unit Price associated with the Price Level specified in the Job. &#160;If the item is not flagged as Use Unit Prices, the Unit Price is calculated based on the current Cost, Billing Rate and Revenue fields if this entry is being manually generated.</span></p>
<p>If this entry was generated via Wizard (using the Fill Lines Button in the Adjustment Journal, or the Return To Inventory button in the Work Order), the revenue values are based on the actual Job History values recorded when the item was initially added to the Work Order / Job, thus allowing the transaction to be 'undone' using the exact costs and revenues present when it was initially created.</p>
<p style="font-weight: bold;">Changed Field: Amount Revenue:<br />
<span style="font-weight: normal;">This field defaults based on the Quantity Billable and the Unit Price. Adjustments referencing Fixed Fee / Allow Extra Billing Items will only calculate revenue if the user manually flags the Extra box.</span></p>
<p style="font-weight: bold;">To Line - New Fields added</p>
<p style="font-weight: bold;">Quantity Billable:<br />
<span style="font-weight: normal;">This field defaults from the Quantity field, and will be used to update Job History if a Work Order or Job is being impacted. It may be cleared by the user.</span></p>
<p>For example, if the Transaction Type is Location to Job, and you have specified a Work Order, when you import costs in the Work Order, the item will be added as positive Quantity and Billable Quantity.</p>
<p style="font-weight: bold;">Extra:<br />
<span style="font-weight: normal;">This field should be flagged if the item should be flagged as an Extra for Allow Extra Billing Items.</span></p>
<p style="font-weight: bold;">Billing Rate Id:<br />
<span style="font-weight: normal;">This field will default to markup a Job or Work Order is specified and the Inventory Item is NOT flagged as Use Unit Prices. &#160;If a Job or Work Order is specified and the Inventory Item is flagged as Use Unit Prices, this field defaults to unit price.</span> &#160;</p>
<p style="font-weight: bold;">Revenue Rate:<br />
<span style="font-weight: normal;">If a Job or Work Order is specified and the Inventory Item is flagged as Use Unit Prices, this field defaults to the Unit Price associated with the Price Level specified in the Job. &#160;If the item is not flagged as Use Unit Prices, the Revenue Rate will be set according the Material Markup specified in the Job/WO's Rate Schedule.</span> &#160;</p>
<p style="font-weight: bold;">Unit Price:<br />
<span style="font-weight: normal;">If a Job or Work Order is specified and the Inventory Item is flagged as Use Unit Prices, this field defaults to the Unit Price associated with the Price Level specified in the Job. &#160;If the item is not flagged as Use Unit Prices, the Unit Price is calculated based on the current Cost, Billing Rate and Revenue fields.</span></p>
<p style="font-weight: bold;">Changed Field: Amount Revenue:</p>
<p>This field defaults based on the Quantity Billable and the Unit Price. Adjustments referencing Fixed Fee / Allow Extra Billing Items will only calculate revenue if the user manually flags the Extra box.</p>
<h3>5.4.1b &#160;&#160;Inventory Adjustments Journal Editing Enhancements</h3>
<p style="font-weight: normal;">When editing a previous entered line (for example, one that was inserted with Copy):</p>
<p style="margin-left: 48px;">Changing the Quantity field now updates the From/To Billable Quantity and Revenue fields when the From/To line(s) is job-related. &#160;</p>
<p style="font-weight: bold; margin-left: 48px;"><span style="font-weight: normal;">When the Inventory Item Id / Cost is changed, Revenue fields are updated when the From/To line(s) is job-related.</span> &#160;</p>
<h3>5.4.2 &#160;&#160;Fill Lines Wizard (Job to Location)</h3>
<p><img src="image/Fill_Lines_Wizard.gif" alt="image\Fill_Lines_Wizard.gif" title="image\Fill_Lines_Wizard.gif" width="80" height="28" border="0" /></p>
<p><font style="font-weight: bold;">New Button: Fill Lines Wizard<br /></font>This button is designed to help you return inventory items entered on a Job or Work Order to your stock location. This button currently supports only the transaction types of Job-to-Loc and Loc-to-Loc (described in the following section). When the Transaction Type of Job-to-Loc is selected, clicking the button will launch the Wizard.</p>
<p style="margin-left: 48px;">Note: the Wizard uses the Equipment originally charged (from Job History) &#160;whenever possible. The global registry option (Setting Key: DefaultEquipmentFromWorkOrder &#160;Setting Value: false) is ignored by the wizard.</p>
<p style="font-weight: bold;"><span style="font-weight: normal;">The actual costs/revenues of the items eligible for return will be used by the wizard so that the original transaction can, in effect, be undone. If an inventory item was brought into the work order at different costs/revenues, the wizard will reflect this and display more than a single line for the part. &#160;Additional fields are displayed to help the user distinguish which item(s) should be returned to inventory:</span></p>
<p style="font-weight: bold; text-decoration: underline;">Fill Lines Wizard: Options Screen</p>
<p style="margin-left: 36.00pt;"><font style="font-weight: bold;">Work Order Id:<br />
Job Id:<br /></font>Complete the Work Order Id if the item was initially added to a Work Order, or a Job Id (if the Work Order was not specified).</p>
<p style="margin-left: 36.00pt;"><font style="font-weight: bold;">Location Id:<br /></font>This required field defines the Location to which the Inventory should be returned. It defaults from the Work Order (if one was selected) but may be changed by the user if needed.</p>
<p style="margin-left: 36.00pt;">Click the Next button at the bottom of the screen to continue.</p>
<p style="font-weight: bold; text-decoration: underline;">Fill Lines Wizard – Items Screen</p>
<p style="margin-left: 36.00pt; font-weight: bold;">Inventory Item Id: &#160;Quantity:<br />
<span style="font-weight: normal;">These display-only fields default from Job History for Inventory Items already associated with the selected Job / Work Order that are eligible for return to inventory.</span></p>
<p style="margin-left: 36.00pt;"><font style="font-weight: bold;">To Return:<br /></font>Enter the quantity of the selected Inventory Item to return to the Location. If this item should NOT be returned to the Location, leave it set to zero.</p>
<p style="margin-left: 36.00pt;"><span style="font-weight: bold;">To Keep:</span><br />
This field initially indicates the quantity associated with the Job / Work Order. It is automatically decreased by the amount the user enters in the To Return field.</p>
<p style="margin-left: 36.00pt; font-weight: bold;">Invoiced:<br />
<span style="font-weight: normal;">This field displays the quantity of this item that has already been invoiced.</span></p>
<p style="margin-left: 36.00pt;"><span style="font-weight: bold;"><font style="font-weight: bold;">S</font>erial / Lot Id:<br /></span>If a serialized item was recently added to the work order, the system will be able to complete this field for you because it was recorded in Job History. &#160;If the item was added in an earlier release, the serial number must be carefully entered by the user if it is to be returned.</p>
<p style="font-weight: bold; margin-left: 48px;">Equipment Id: &#160;Inventory Name: &#160;Extra: &#160;Qty Bill: &#160;&#160;Bill Type Id: &#160;Revenue Rate:<br />
Unit Price: &#160;TOT Revenue: &#160;Unit Cost:<br />
<span style="font-weight: normal;">These display only fields reflect the Job History for items on this work order/job.</span></p>
<p style="font-weight: bold; margin-left: 48px;">InvoiceId: To Unbill:<br />
<span style="font-weight: normal;">If this line has been invoiced, the Invoice Id will be completed. &#160;If you set the To Return quantity for this line, the To Unbill: field will default from it if the registry entry option to set the Quantity Billable from the Quantity Returned is enabled.</span></p>
<p style="font-weight: bold; margin-left: 48px;">Serial No. From (JCH Serial No?):<br />
<span style="font-weight: normal;">If the Serial Number on this line was completed by the system based on it's value in Job History, this box will be flagged. &#160;If the Serial Number entered manually by the user, the box will be clear.</span></p>
<p style="margin-left: 36.00pt;">Click the Finish button when you have updated any lines requiring adjustment.</p>
<p style="margin-left: 36.00pt;"><font style="font-weight: bold;">IMPORTANT:</font> After completing the Wizard, you must SAVE the journal entry.</p>
<h3>5.4.2a &#160;&#160;Fill Lines Wizard (Location to Location)</h3>
<p>This enhancement to the Fill Lines Wizard in the Inventory Adjustments Journal automates the transfer of all inventory at one location to another location. The Location to Location Wizard will be invoked if the Location to Location button is selected when the wizard is launched.</p>
<p style="font-weight: bold; text-decoration: underline;"><span style="font-weight: bold; text-decoration: underline;"><u>Fill Lines Wizard: Please Your Transfer Locations</u></span></p>
<p style="margin-left: 36.00pt; font-weight: bold;">Location Id:</p>
<p style="margin-left: 36.00pt; font-weight: bold;">From/Adj:<br />
<span style="font-weight: normal;">This required field defines the Location from which the Inventory should transferred.</span></p>
<p style="margin-left: 36.00pt; font-weight: bold;">To:<br />
<span style="font-weight: normal;">Enter the Location the Inventory should be transferred to.</span> &#160;</p>
<p>Click the OK button to continue, or Cancel to exit the Wizard without completing the transaction.<br />
<br />
When the user clicks the OK button, the Wizard auto-fills the lines in the child with the current list of on hand parts numbers and quantities in the From location specified and sets them up to transfer to the specified To location; note that Inventory Items flagged as obsolete are excluded. The user may make any changes needed before saving the entry.</p>
<p>When the user saves the Inventory Adjustments Journal entry, the Location to Location transfer will be made.</p>
<h3>5.4.3 &#160;Adjustment to Remove a Serial Item from an Inventory Location</h3>
<p><span id="BugEvents141">The Inventory Adjustments Journal may now be used to remove a Serial No from an inventory Location; this would be used to handle the case where SAMPro thinks the item is in stock but actually it isn't. &#160;This provides an alternative method of removing a serial item to the Physical Count functionality.</span></p>
<p><span>To remove a serial item, your entry should be set up as follows:</span></p>
<p style="margin-left: 48px;"><span style="font-weight: bold;">Transaction Type:</span> Adjustment</p>
<p style="margin-left: 48px;"><span style="font-weight: bold;">Inventory Item Id: Serial Number:</span><span style="font-weight: bold;"><br /></span>Identifies the item to be removed.</p>
<p style="margin-left: 48px;"><span style="font-weight: bold;">Quantity:</span> -1.0 &#160;(displays as 1.000-)</p>
<p style="margin-left: 48px;"><span style="font-weight: bold;">Unit Cost:</span> <span style="font-weight: bold;"><br /></span>This field defaults from the Inventory Item but may be adjusted by the user.</p>
<p style="margin-left: 48px;"><span style="font-weight: bold;">From/Adj: Location:</span><br />
Enter the Location from which the Serialized Item should be removed.</p>
<p style="margin-left: 48px;"><span style="font-weight: bold;">GL Account / GL Entity</span><br />
If a impact to the General Ledger is desired, the GL Account / GL Entity (if applicable) fields of both the From/Adjust and To lines should be completed. A negative debit will be written for the GL Account / GL Entity specified in the From/Adjust line, and a negative credit will be written for the GL Account / GL Entity specified in the To line (note: a one-sided GL Entry is NOT permitted in this journal).</p>
<p>After this entry is saved, the item's On Hand value will be set to zero, but the Serial/Lot record is not deleted.</p>
<h3>5.4.4 Intercompany/Security Support for Inventory Adjustments</h3>
<p style="margin-left: 8px;">If Intercompany security is enabled, the appropriate Security Id is now included on history entries posted to Job, Tax and Inventory History from manual and Wizard entries. &#160;</p>
<p>The system now validates that the GL Entity not blank when intercompany is enabled.<br />
<br />
When an Inventory Adjustment is created, the system generates Intercompany GLH when appropriate.&#160;&#160;This does NOT apply to Adjustment-type entries.&#160;&#160;No Intercompany GLH is generated when From/To entities belong to the same company.</p>
<p>The full screen view now shows To/From Company Ids.</p>
<p>This release fixes the posting of non-intercompany GLH to include appropriate security setting.&#160;&#160;Previously these entries were posting with scrty_rn = 0.</p>
<h3>5.4.5 New Tab: GLH</h3>
<p>This tab displays the GL History postings associated with the selected transaction. The following columns appear on this tab:</p>
<p style="margin-left: 36.00pt;">Account - Account Name - Entity<br />
Period – Company - Security<br />
I/C (Yes if this post was generated by Intercompany Processing, No if not)<br />
Journal - Trx Id – Date - Trx Count</p>
<h3>5.4.6 Inventory Adjustment - Inventory Tab Changes</h3>
<p><span style="font-weight: bold;">Inventory Tab New Fields - On-Hand:</span><br />
If the Location field is completed, the current On-Hand quantity (if any) will appear these display-only fields.</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: bold;">Inventory Name:</span> &#160;The Inventory Item Name has been added to the right-hand side of each. &#160;A revised customization file may be required.</p>
<p>A revised customization file is required to see the above changes to the standard view if the upgrade to this version did not entail a database conversion; contact your support representative for assistance.</p>
<h2>5.5. Inventory Receipts Journal</h2>
<h3>5.5.1 Main Tab</h3>
<p style="font-weight: bold;">New Button:</p>
<p><img src="image/AutoSetReceived.gif" alt="image\AutoSetReceived.gif" title="image\AutoSetReceived.gif" width="88" height="28" border="0" /> Clicking the new Auto Set Quantity Received button sets the Received quantity for all items still on order. The Received quantity field may then be adjusted by the user if needed. Serialized items with a PO quantity of greater than one must be manually adjusted.</p>
<p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">&#160;</p>
<p style="font-weight: bold;">New Field:</p>
<p><font style="font-weight: bold;">Billable Freight:<br /></font> COP Invoicing has been enhanced to obtain the freight charge from this field, if completed. It will appear on the COP Invoice. Registry entries (see customer release note 15.1.1) are required to receive COP Dropship Orders is this journal.</p>
<p class="Support" style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">&#160;</p>
<h2>5.6 Compute Corporate Metrics</h2>
<h3>5.6.1 Overview: Enhancement to Set Inventory Item Reorder / Order Up to Levels</h3>
<p>The Compute Corporate Metrics function has been enhanced to include the re-computation of the Reorder Level and Order Up To (Min/Max) fields. Typically, this would be done for a period of less than a year. For example, we could capture historical startup parts usage from the previous spring and use them to generate appropriate Reorder/Order Up To levels to assure an adequate stock new spring.</p>
<p>This re-computation will ONLY occurs if you check the Compute box for Min/Max (Reorder Level/Order Up To) in the Compute Corporate Metrics Checklist screen. If this option is checked, the software does not allow ANY other option to be checked, and also validates that the Stock days (from the range screen) is greater than 0. Note that the date range specified on the range screen would be for prior historical periods therefore wouldn't be applicable to any other metric calculations.</p>
<p>If the Show Log option is selected on the range screen, the system will display the original min/max and the new min/max for each part calculated.<br /></p>
<p style="margin-left: 36.00pt; font-weight: bold;">Tip: Initial Values</p>
<p style="margin-left: 36.00pt;">Initial values for the Lead Time Add On and Stock Days fields may be set via registry; these values may be overridden by the user. In the following example, the initial value of the Lead Time Add On is set to 10, the Stock Days to 30, and the Show Log box is set to checked.</p>
<p style="margin-left: 36.00pt;">Registry Id: sys-start-scmptecrprtmtrcs</p>
<p style="margin-left: 36.00pt;">Setting Key: InitialValueFor~crprtmtrcs.ld-tme-add-on Setting Value: 10</p>
<p style="margin-left: 36.00pt;">Setting Key: InitialValueFor~crprtmtrcs.stck-dys Setting Value: 30</p>
<p style="margin-left: 36.00pt;">Setting Key InitialValueFor~crprtmtrcs.shw-lg Setting Value: true</p>
<h3>5.6.2 Compute Corporate Metrics Range Screen</h3>
<p style="font-weight: bold;">Changed Fields:</p>
<p><font style="font-weight: bold;">Start Date: End Date:<br /></font>Enter the date range for which you wish to compute metrics and Reorder/Order Up To levels. These fields are required. The date range determines the period for which the usage is calculated for.</p>
<p style="font-weight: bold;">New Fields:</p>
<p><font style="font-weight: bold;">Lead Time Add On:<br /></font>Enter the number of days that will be added to the system-calculated Purchasing Lead Time to allow for internal time needed to create and receive a purchase order. This field This field is used in conjunction with the average daily use of the item (by Location) to calculate the Reorder Level as follows:</p>
<p>[Average Daily Quantity Used or Sold] *([Vendor Lead Time] + [Lead Time Add On])</p>
<p><font style="font-weight: bold;">Stock Days:<br /></font>The number of days the user would like to keep inventory on hand. This field is used in conjunction with the average daily use of the item (by Location) to calculate the Order Up To level as follows:</p>
<p>[Average Daily Quantity Used or Sold] *[Stock Days]</p>
<p><font style="font-weight: bold;">Inventory Group:<br /></font> This range allows users to run the calculation for a select group of inventory.</p>
<p><font style="font-weight: bold;">Location Id:<br /></font>If completed, the Inventory Item Location fields (including the Turns field) will only be updated for the specified location. The Location Id field will not be used for any other purpose.</p>
<p><font style="font-weight: bold;">Inventory Group:<br /></font>This range may be completed to filter the Inventory Items that are to be updated.</p>
<p><font style="font-weight: bold;">Show Log:<br /></font>If this box is checked, a diagnostic log of the computations is displayed in a pop up box.</p>
<h3>5.6.3. Compute Corporate Metrics Checklist Screen</h3>
<p><font style="font-weight: bold;">New Field: Compute Min/Max (Reorder Level/Order Up To)<br /></font>The Reorder Level/Order Up to computations will ONLY occur if this box is checked. If this option is checked, the software does not allow ANY other option to be checked, and also validates that the Stock days (from the range screen) is greater than 0.</p>
<p>When you click the Go button, the selected Metrics will be generated and Reorder / Order Up To levels calculated on the Inventory Item Location tab.</p>
<h2>5.7 Inventory Physical Count Processing</h2>
<p>The Build Export Files function now supports Count Cycle filtering.</p>
<h3>5.7.1. View Inventory Physical Count</h3>
<p><font style="font-weight: bold;">New Field: Count Cycle<br /></font>If this field is completed, the Load On Hand and Built Export Files functions will be filtered to only include Inventory with the corresponding Count Cycle on the Inventory Location Tab (note the Magnify button must be clicked to access this field).</p>
<p>Other Changes in this release:</p>
<p style="margin-left: 36.00pt;">It is no longer necessary to save the empty batch before selecting Load On Hand.</p>
<p style="margin-left: 36.00pt;">You can change the Location, Count Cycle, and Count Date as long as there are no lines on the Child Tab.</p>
<p style="margin-left: 36.00pt;">The 'Please Enter The First &amp; Last Item Ids To Include' dialog has been removed.</p>
<p style="margin-left: 36.00pt;">An error message is displayed if the Location or Count Date have not been entered before Load On Hand is selected.</p>
<p style="margin-left: 36.00pt;">A Lot Status of 'Untested' no longer appears for non-serialized items.</p>
<h3>5.7.2 Physical Count Report</h3>
<p>The Pick Sequence had been added as right-hand column. The report is ordered by Pick Sequence. If it is sorted by Inventory Group, the report will appear in Pick Sequence for each Inventory Group.</p>
<h3>5.7.3 Physical Count Export / Import</h3>
<p>The Physical Count Export/Import feature now includes functionality for serialized inventory items:</p>
<p style="margin-left: 48px;">A Serial # column has been added to the exported spreadsheet; one line will be included for each serialized item.</p>
<p style="margin-left: 48px;">Serial # validation has been added to the import function (only quantities of 1 or 0 are allowed).</p>
<p style="margin-left: 48px;">The import function now copies the Serial # to the lines on the viewer</p>
<p style="margin-left: 88px;"><span style="font-weight: bold;">Note:</span> although the format of the exported spreadsheet has been changed, the program will still accept spreadsheets predating the Serialized functionality.</p>
<h3>5.7.4 Physical Count Viewer</h3>
<p>This enhancement adds consistency between the List Physical Count Report and the viewer. Currently the report has the following sort options which can be set by the user:</p>
<p style="margin-left: 48px;">Sort by Picking Sequence and Item Id</p>
<p style="margin-left: 48px;">Sort by Inventory Group, Picking Sequence, and Item Id</p>
<p>The report already shows the Picking Sequence (the last field on the line); it has been modified to show the sort sequence in the header.</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: bold;">Items Tab New Field: Line Remark</span><br />
The Inventory Item's Pick Sequence will appear in this display field.</p>
<p style="font-weight: bold;"><img src="image/Load_OnHand.gif" alt="" style="border: none;" border="0" /> &#160;Load On Hand Enter Options Form</p>
<p style="font-weight: bold;">New Field: Sort by Inventory Group?<br />
<span style="font-weight: normal;">If this box is checked, the on-hand items will be sorted by Inventory Group, then Pick Sequence, then Inventory Item Id. &#160;If this box is not checked, the on-hand items will be sorted by Pick Sequence, then Inventory Item Id.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: bold;">First Included Item Id: &#160;&#160;Last Included Item Id:</span><br />
These fields allow the user to restrict the function to a range of items. The files are pre-filled so that all items (within the Count Cycle, if applicable) will be included.</p>
<h2>5.8 Inventory Group</h2>
<p><font style="font-weight: bold;">Inventory Group</font> <font style="font-weight: bold;">User 1-5:<br /></font>These fields may be used by TechAnywhere assist in filtering records for TechAnywhere access, or for entering any information your company wishes to retain.</p>

<p><font style="font-weight: bold;">Location</font> <font style="font-weight: bold;">User 1-5:<br /></font>These fields may be used by TechAnywhere assist in filtering records for TechAnywhere access, or for entering any information your company wishes to retain.</p>
<h2>5.10 Inventory Average Unit Cost Calculations</h2>
<p><span id="BugEvents21">In this release, the system posts</span> positive quantity changes before negative quantity changes in the reversal process. This prevents the computed average cost from erroneously being set to zero if the location's stock is very low.</p>
<p>In previous releases, the average cost of an inventory item could be incorrectly set under the following conditions:</p>
<p style="margin-left: 36.00pt;">1. Inventory item "widget" has a quantity of 1 at the Main location.<br />
2. Widget is used on a work order from main location, bringing the quantity down to 0 and also resets average cost in the process.<br />
3. The item is removed from the WO - it goes back into inventory at main location, but at a $0 average cost.</p>
<p>In this release, the average cost is calculated correctly when an item is returned to the location under the above scenario.</p>
<h2>5.11 Inventory Item</h2>
<h3>5.11.1 Main Tab</h3>
<p><span style="font-weight: bold;">New Field: Core?</span><br />
Flag this field if this is a core component by double-clicking on it. This field may be currently be used to filter the inventory list and the Stock Status Report.</p>
<h3>5.11.2 Other Tab</h3>
<p>This version corrects a problem where the Inventory Item viewer changed to Add mode if you entered an invalid Id in the Superceded By field. The <span id="BugEvents51">message "Error: Record Not Found" is now displayed for the invalid Id.</span></p>
<h3>5.11.3 Average Cost Calculations</h3>
<p>In certain cases, receiving a quantity of an item at one price, and then vouchering it at a much lower price produced an adjustment (quantity * price adjustment). This could leave the quantity on hand with a negative value if the quantity on hand was reduced <span style="font-weight: bold;">before</span> the AP transaction was entered. In this release, the Cost on Hand is prevented from going negative.</p>

<p><span style="font-weight: bold;">New Field: Print Zero Balance Statements?</span><br />
Flagging this field enables the user to print a zero balance statement for the selected client or clients on this report. &#160;<b><span style="font-weight: normal;">Clients with a total outstanding dollar balance in AR History equal to zero will be included on the report, subject to the setting of the other ranges.</span></b></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: bold;">New Range: Client Status</span><br />

<h2>6.3 AR Cash Receipts Journal</h2>
<p>AR Cash Receipts evaluates whether a transaction has been deposited in order to determined if it can be changed. This version supports a recent enhancement where edited Bank Deposit transactions are saved with a tack number appended to their Transaction Id.</p>
<p>This release corrects:</p>
<p style="margin-left: 48px;">A spurious Tab Mismatch error for Bad Debt entries.</p>
<p style="margin-left: 48px;">A very sporadic “Invalid Column name 'invcemstr_id' encountered by some users running this function.</p>
<h3>6.3.1 AR Cash Receipts Main Tab</h3>
<p style="font-weight: bold;">New Button: Apply Discount</p>
<p><img src="image/ApplyDiscount.gif" alt="image\ApplyDiscount.gif" title="image\ApplyDiscount.gif" width="94" height="28" border="0" /></p>
<p>A new button, Apply Discount, has been added to the Main tab. When you click this button, the Discount fields of the selected invoices will be computed based on the Total Discount entered.</p>
<p><font style="font-weight: bold;">New Field: Pro Rate<br /></font>When this field is flagged, the Discount fields of the selected invoices will be automatically be updated as you click on new invoices to select them. Note that the Invoice Amount and Discount fields must be completed for correct operation.</p>
<p><font style="font-weight: bold;">Changed Field: GL Entity</font> <font style="font-weight: bold;">Id:</font><br />
If Intercompany Processing is implemented (the sys-ffv-global-settings registry’s IntercompanyEnabled option is set to true) and if this Entity does not match the GL Entities referenced in the child tabs, the appropriate Intercompany postings to GL History will be made when this transaction is saved.</p>
<p>The GL Entity Name now displays next to the Id field.</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: bold;">Changed Field: Check Number</span><br />
This field has been expanded from 20 to 25 characters to correspond to the Reference Number on the Work Order COD Tab.&#160;The system uses these two fields to match the cash receipt to the WO COD payment.&#160;When they didn’t match exactly (if the check number was truncated), a zero was returned back to the Work Order COD tab. This release corrects this issue.</p>
<h3>6.3.2 New GLH Tab</h3>
<p>This release Implements a new GLH parent tab in journals that post to GL History. This tab displays the GL History postings associated with the selected transaction. The following columns appear on this tab:</p>
<p style="margin-left: 36.00pt;">Account - Account Name - Entity<br />
Period – Company - Security<br />
I/C (Yes if this post was generated by Intercompany Processing, No if not)Journal - Trx Id – Date - Trx Count</p>
<h3>6.3.3 AR Tab (middle section)</h3>
<p>In this release, the only editable fields are the Invoice Amount and Discount Taken, and the Description (click the Magnify button to access).</p>
<h3>6.3.4 Unapplied Receipts/Deposits: Change to Default Behavior</h3>
<p>In previous releases, Unapplied Cash Receipts only supported 4 digit numbers, allowing only 9998 entries (UN0001- UN9999) entries to be made. This release enhances unapplied numbering to accommodate 6-digit numbers. NOTE: the first number allocated by the new code will be 'UN100001'.</p>
<p>In a recent release, most fields on the AR tab became display-only.&#160;&#160;Only the Amount, Discount Taken and Description fields remained open for data entry.&#160;&#160;Unapplied cash receipts/deposits should now be entered as follows:</p>
<p style="margin-left: 36.00pt;">Add a New line</p>
<p style="margin-left: 36.00pt;">Click its Magnify button</p>
<p style="margin-left: 36.00pt;">Click the Unapplied Deposit button</p>
<p style="margin-left: 36.00pt;">An input form will appear: complete the fields needed for the unapplied deposit</p>
<p style="margin-left: 36.00pt;">When you save the AR Cash Receipts entry, the Invoice Number for the unapplied deposit will be generated by the system as UN######.</p>
<p>In recent releases, the Amount of an unapplied receipt/credit could not be changed by the user when it was applied against customer invoices. This release supports the partial use of unapplied receipts/credits by allowing the user to change the amount.</p>
<p style="margin-left: 36.00pt;"><font style="font-weight: bold;">Important:</font> When changing the amount of an unapplied receipt/credit, the user must use the minus (hyphen) key to enter the desired negative value. The user will be warned if the amount of the unapplied receipt is greater than zero.</p>
<h3>6.3.5 Refresh Totals Option</h3>
<p>A new option, 'Refresh Totals' has been added to the Record menu of this viewer.&#160;&#160;When pushed, it forces the 'Receipts Entered' and 'Discount Entered' accumulators to match the content of the child lines. This option allows the user to get this journal back into sync if multiple insertions and deletions of lines result in the detail and header totals not matching. This new menu option is currently only enabled in this journal.</p>
<h3>6.3.6 Enter Invoices Wizard</h3>
<p>When entering an invoice into the wizard the client for all invoices is derived from the client associated with the first invoice master record selected.&#160;This can cause inconsistencies if an Override Client is specified on a Work Order, or the user changes the Client on a Job before the invoices are paid.&#160;&#160;In this scenario it is possible to generate a cash receipt to the wrong client.</p>
<p>In this release, the user is warned if any subsequent invoices selected in the wizard reference a different Client in the Invoice Master Record, and is prevented from adding them:</p>
<p style="margin-left: 48px;">Invoice 11111 is for Client 'BigBox'</p>
<p style="margin-left: 48px;">This Cash Receipt is being recorded for Client 'Mom and Pop'</p>
<p>Note: the Client displayed in the Wizard is now derived from the Invoice Master, not the Job.</p>
<h2>6.4 AR Sales Journal</h2>
<p>This release implements Tab Mismatch processing in the AR Sales Journal for validation on posting to ARH, JCH and GLH.</p>
<h3>6.4.1 New GLH Tab</h3>
<p>This release Implements a new GLH parent tab in journals that post to GL History. This tab displays the GL History postings associated with the selected transaction. The following columns appear on this tab:</p>
<p style="margin-left: 36.00pt;">Account - Account Name - Entity<br />
Period – Company - Security<br />
I/C (Yes if this post was generated by Intercompany Processing, No if not)<br />
Journal - Trx Id – Date - Trx Count</p>
<h3>6.4.2 Costs Tab</h3>
<p><font style="font-weight: bold;">New Field - Drop Ship:<br /></font>This display-only field will be flagged if the displayed Costs are associated with a Drop-Shipped Purchase Order generated from the Client Order.</p>
<h2>6.5 AR Terms</h2>
<p><font style="font-weight: bold;">New Field - Obsolete?<br /></font>If this field is checked, the record is considered Obsolete, and it may not be directly specified during data-entry (either by entering the Id or selecting it from a list). Obsoleted records can be edited and the Obsolete option can be cleared when necessary. When you check the Obsolete field, the following message box will be displayed:</p>
<p style="margin-left: 36.00pt;">“You have elected to obsolete this record. Would you like to see existing references to this record?”</p>
<p style="margin-left: 48px;">If you click Yes, the system will display a viewer that provides click-through access to all tables referencing this record.</p>
<h2>6.6 Start C<span style="font-weight: bold;">ompute Finance Charges</span></h2>
<p style="margin-left: 8px;">If this function is run for multiple clients, the AR Control Account selected by the customer is correctly debited in GL History.</p>
<h1>7. Invoicing</h1>
<h2>7.1 Registry</h2>
<h3>7.1.1 Service Invoice</h3>
<h5>Auto Email - New Registry Issue</h5>
<p><span style="font-weight: bold;">Id:</span> sys-report-serviceinvoice</p>
<p><b><i style="font-weight: normal;">If the registry option autoemail is set to true, the following line <span style="font-weight: bold;">must</span> be added to the registry in order for the auto-mail to occur:</i></b></p>
<p><b>Setting Key:</b> autoemailwhenprinted&#160;&#160;&#160;<b>Setting Value:</b> true</p>
<p>This line should be added rather than changing the autoemail line because it support other functionality: it sets the To Address on the invoice to the Email Address.</p>
<h3>7.1.2 Start Compute Service Invoices</h3>
<p>The following registry entry may be enabled to provide a possible performance enhancement for the Start Service Billing Compute function:</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: bold;">Registry Id:</span> sys-start-ssrvcebllngcmpte</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: bold;">Setting Key:</span> &#160;CostOrRevenueFilter &#160;&#160;&#160;<span style="font-weight: bold;">Setting Value:</span> true &#160;(default is false)</p>
<p>Note: this registry eliminates JOB EOM transactions from the calculation; this may or may not impact the performance of Start Service Billing Compute.</p>
<h3>7.1.3 Start Create PM Billing - Disable Common Lines</h3>
<p>A Version 8.2 enhancement allows 'common' lines to be included on a single PM Invoice so that taxable and non-taxable components can be handled appropriately &#160;(via Job Cost Category). Lines are considered 'common' when they have the same values for these fields: Client Site Id, Billing Schedule Date, Job Id, Cost Code, Billing Item, Payment Alias and Master Contract. Since some user prefer not to combine 'common' PM Billing lines, the following registry has been enabled:</p>
<p>Registry Setting to disable Combining Common Lines</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: bold;">Registry Id:</span> sys-start-scrtepmbllng</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: bold;">Setting Key:</span> PMBillingDisableCombiningCommonLines &#160;<span style="font-weight: bold;">Setting Value:</span> true (default false)</p>
<p>When this option is enabled, one WO Invoice will be generated for each Client Site PM Billing Invoice line.</p>
<h3>7.1.4 Start Create PM Billings - Invoice Description Default</h3>
<p>The following existing (but under-utilized) registry setting provides a brief (40 character) default description for the PM Invoice if the Invoice Description is blank on the Client Site PM Billing tab or the Master Contract Adv. Billing tab. &#160;</p>
<p>Id: sys-start-scrtepmbllng&#160;<br />
Setting Key: InvoiceDescription&#160;&#160;Setting Value: <span style="font-style: italic;"><i>description</i></span></p>
<p>In this release, the system will write the phrase "PM Invoice" to PM Invoice Work Orders if the above registry option is not implemented, and an Invoice Description is also absent from the Client Site and/or Master Contract billing tabs. &#160;</p>
<h3>7.1.5 Report Service Invoice - Specify Bitmap by Site's Account Manager, Service Manager, Dispatcher or Branch</h3>
<p>This release enables additional registry setting keys for sys-report-serviceinvoice that provides additional bitmap control over and above that provided by the report registry hierarchy. When printing Service Invoices, the system will look at the Client Site record referenced in the Work Order or Quote to find the appropriate record id to check for an override id match. If it is referenced in the registry, the override bitmap will be used. If an override bitmap is NOT specified, the system will use the standard bitmap (Setting Key: bitmap) specified in the registry. &#160;It your firm has multiple registry entries (e.g., by Security, Branch, Users, etc.) the additional registry options should be added to each registry record.</p>
<p>A revised version of the Service Invoice SERVICEINVOICEv80b017.rpt) dated 9/19/2014 or later is also required to implement this functionality:</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: bold;">Id:</span> sys-report-serviceinvoice</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: bold;">Setting Key:</span> BitmapOverrideBasedOn &#160;&#160;&#160;<span style="font-weight: bold;">Setting Value:</span> <span style="font-style: italic;"><i>FieldInClientSite</i></span></p>
<p>This option turns on the override behavior, and defines which record in the Client Site will be used to define the bitmap override. Valid values are:</p>
<p>accountmanager<br />
branch<br />
servicemanager<br />
dispatcher</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: bold;">Setting Key:</span> <span style="font-style: italic;"><i>FieldInClientSite~RecordId</i></span> &#160;<span><font style="font-style: normal; font-weight: bold;">Setting Value:</font></span> <span style="font-style: italic;"><i>sharepath\bitmap.bmp</i></span></p>
<p>This entry defines matches the override with the bitmap. &#160;One entry needs to be created for each override bitmap. The Setting Key defines the field and individual record Id; the Setting Value defines the bitmap. &#160;</p>
<p><span style="text-decoration: underline;"><u>Example: &#160;Use the Client Site's Account Manager to Specify the Override</u></span></p>
<p>In this example, assume that Jean,Tim, Joe and Sarah are account managers. Jean and Tim need special overrides; Joe and Sarah do not.</p>

<h2>7.2 Reports</h2>
<h3>7.2.1 Service Invoice</h3>
<p>Now supports bitmaps defined by Company/Security.</p>
<p>The revised report (SERVICEINVOICEv80b017.rpt) dated 06/05/2014 corrects a formatting issue encountered during a batch run if any Billing Items referenced FORMAT_XX or FORMAT_XXX in addition to other formats.</p>
<h3>7.2.2 Record Billing Adjustments/ Progress Billing:</h3>
<p>When intercompany processing is enabled, the Company/Security is now correctly set for the AR Sales Journal and resulting history records when Progress Invoices are posted.</p>
<p>The A/R Control GL Entity is now displayed on the Progress Billing Post Report. Although the GL Entities for the Sale Tax entries do not appear on this report, they are written to history correctly.</p>
<h3>7.2.3 Service Worksheet Report</h3>
<p>The Service Billing Worksheet (SERVICEWORKSHEETv80b017.rpt) dated 4/19/2013 supports a new option, Equipment Detail. When set to On, the Equipment Name and Serial Number will be printed on the Worksheet following the Work Requested. By default, this option is set to Off.</p>
<h3>7.2.4 Enhanced Report Progress Invoice Template 3</h3>
<p>The revised construction invoice report (RININV3.rpt) dated 2016-05-12 has been enhanced to show billed retainage as a positive number with the label 'Billed Retainage'. &#160;In previous versions of this report, billed retainage was shown as a negative value, with the label 'Less Retainage'.</p>
<p>This report also supports a registry option to override the 'Billed Retainage' label.</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: bold;">Id:</span> sys-report-rininv3</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: bold;">Setting Key:</span> lbl_billedretainage &#160;&#160;<span style="font-weight: bold;">Setting Value:</span> <span style="font-style: italic;"><i>alternatelabeltext</i></span></p>
<p>This could be implemented to implement the Holdbacks terminology preferred in Canada:</p>
<p style="margin-left: 48px;"><span style="font-weight: bold;">Setting Key:</span> lbl_billedretainage &#160;&#160;<span style="font-weight: bold;">Setting Value:</span> Billed Holdbacks</p>
<p>This report also supports multiple-page text box printing and uses the updated Arial font for a more modern look. &#160;Since the header information of this report now more closely resembles the Service Invoice we recommend that you use your Service Invoice bitmap for this report (may require revising the sys-report-rininv3 registry setting). This version of the report also supports enhanced text box handling which allows the contents of the 3000 character Job Invoice Description to be split between pages if needed</p>
<h2>7.3 Sales Tax Group</h2>

<h2>7.5 Start Create PM Billing</h2>
<p>This release corrects a loophole which allowed PM Billing lines from Master Contract to 'disappear' if another user ran and exited Create PM Billing while the first user had this function open. <span style="font-weight: bold;">&#160;</span></p>
<p>Corrects a problem where PM Work Orders and PM Invoices were not generated if the Master Contract Invoice Description (on the Schedule or Advanced Billing tab) contained a apostrophe (single quote).</p>
<p>In this release, the system will write the phrase "PM Invoice" to PM Invoice Work Orders if the registry detailed in Customer Release Note 7.1.4 option is not implemented, and an Invoice Description is also absent from the Client Site and/or Master Contract billing tabs. &#160;</p>
<p>The Sales Tax Exceptions tab is now consulted so that Sales Tax is correctly assessed on Recurring APT PM's with Common Lines where one line is taxable and the other non-taxable.</p>
<p>This release corrects a runtime error when this function is run for the old-style RININV4 PM Billing.</p>
<p>The GL Entity from the Job Cost Code should be used to default the GL Entity written to GL History for PM accruals. This release corrects an error that resulted in the GL Entity being ignored. The problem has been corrected for future accruals but not for those generated in versions 8.2.545.030-038. Please contact your support department if assistance is needed to correct your data.</p>
<h3>7.5.0 Common Lines Invoice Overview</h3>
<p>This enhancement allows 'common' lines to be included on a single PM Invoice so that taxable and non-taxable components can be handled appropriately. See Customer Release Note 7.1.3 for a registry option to disable this new default behavior.</p>
<p>Lines are considered 'common' when <span id="BugEvents2812">they have the same values for these fields:</span></p>
<p style="margin-left: 48px;"><span>Client Site Id, Billing Schedule Date, Job Id, Cost Code, Billing Item, Payment Alias, Master Contract</span></p>
<p style="margin-left: 8px;">This allows common PM Billing lines with different Job Cost Categories to appear on the same PM Work Order Invoice with both taxable and non-taxable components. This functionality is currently supported on the Client Site PM Billing schedule and from Master Contract.</p>
<h3>7.5.1 Client Site PM Billing Tab</h3>
<p style="margin-left: 8px;">Client the Magnify Button to Display the following:</p>
<p style="margin-left: 8px; font-weight: bold;">New Field: Job Cost Category Id:</p>
<p style="margin-left: 8px;"><span id="BugEvents293">In some States certain Preventive Maintenances are taxable while others are not taxable.&#160;If completed, this field overrides the default Cost Category derived from the&#160;sys-start-scrtepmbllng registry's Cost Category option can be overridden with the value on the Site Billing Schedule line.&#160;&#160;&#160;This will allow the user full control to make the Billing taxable or non-taxable as needed.\</span></p>
<p style="margin-left: 8px;"><span>This field also enables a single PM Invoice to be generated with taxable and non-taxable components. To do so, create 2 lines with the following fields entered identically, but with</span> <span style="font-weight: bold;">different</span> <span>Job Cost Categories to define the taxable and non-taxable elements:</span></p>
<p style="margin-left: 48px;"><span id="BugEvents28112">Billing Schedule Date, Job Id, Cost Code, Billing Item</span></p>
<p style="margin-left: 48px;">Tip: Invoice Description</p>
<p style="margin-left: 48px;">You may wish to edit the Invoice Description to better indicate the taxable/non-taxable (material/labor) components of the invoice).</p>
<h3>7.5.2 Master Contract Site List</h3>
<p style="margin-left: 8px;"><span id="BugEvents2911">In some States certain Preventive Maintenances are taxable while others are not taxable.</span> <span id="BugEvents301">When Create PM Billings is run, the system now passes the Job Cost Category (if specified) from the Master Contract Site List to the corresponding new field in the Client Site PM Billing schedule.</span> <span>&#160;If completed, this field overrides the default Cost Category derived from the &#160;sys-start-scrtepmbllng registry's Cost Category option. This allows the user to make the Billing taxable or non-taxable as needed by the selection of an appropriate Cost Category.</span></p>
<p style="margin-left: 8px;">Master Contract Time of Service Billings can also be configured to produce a single invoice with taxable and non-taxable components. &#160;The same site should appear twice on the Master Contract Site List, with a different Value amount and Cost Category for each line (for example, if the PM is partially taxable and partially non-taxable). &#160;The Revenue written to the WO's Other tab is correctly calculated according to the Value / Cost Category on each Site List line, and appropriately handled as taxable/non taxable.</p>
<h2>7.6 Start Kimmons1 File Import (New Function)</h2>
<p>Note: it may be necessary to run Start Update Function List and then assign this function to the appropriate User Groups and Functions records.</p>
<h5>Purpose:</h5>
<p>This function allows Flat Rate data to imported from Profit Strategies' Kimmons1 type files.&#160;A Kimmons2 type file is not used by this import. &#160;The Profit Strategies Kimmons1 files this function imports do NOT include a header record.&#160;&#160;</p>
<h5>Usage:</h5>
<p>The function will read the Kimmons1 file and proceed to create/update the Flat Rate Categories.&#160;&#160;If the corresponding Flat Rate Id exists it will be updated and the date updated will be changed; if the Flat Rate Id does not exist it will be created and the date created field loaded.&#160;&#160;This function will ignore all Child Tab updates.&#160;&#160;Any data which already exist on any of the child tabs (Labor, Inventory, Material) is unaffected by the Import: it would be up to the user to adjust these if needed.&#160;&#160;No Kimmons2 records will be processed.</p>
<h5>Important Fields:</h5>
<p><span style="font-weight: bold;">Cost Category:</span><br />

<h3>8.6.4 Contract Items Tab Enhancement</h3>
<p>The following fields have been added to the Edit screen (accessed via right-click) of the Contract Items tab. Previously, these features were only available in Record Billing Adjustments.</p>
<p style="font-weight: bold;">Retainage Options</p>
<p style="margin-left: 48px;">Five options are provided: Normal, Current, Hold, Manual and Release All. The option name in use will appear to the right of the Next Inv. Retainage field.<br />
<br />
<img src="image/NormalRetainage.gif" alt="image\NormalRetainage.gif" title="image\NormalRetainage.gif" width="94" height="28" border="0" /> ‘’Normal‘’ is the default &#160;SAMPro behavior &#160;– the Total Invoiced times the Retainage %. If the user wishes to adjust the Retainage percent, clicking the "Normal‘’ button will recompute the Next Invoice Retainage field.&#160;&#160;</p>
<p style="margin-left: 48px;"><img src="image/CurrentRetainage.gif" alt="image\CurrentRetainage.gif" title="image\CurrentRetainage.gif" width="94" height="28" border="0" /> ‘’Current" means apply the Retainage % to the Next Invoice Total only.’ This allows the user to lower the Retainage % without releasing previously held retainage values. To switch to this option, the user must push the button labeled Current.</p>
<p style="margin-left: 48px;"><img src="image/HoldRetainage.gif" alt="image\HoldRetainage.gif" title="image\HoldRetainage.gif" width="94" height="28" border="0" /> Hold means no more retainage should be withheld but DOES NOT release previously held retainage values. To switch to this option, the user must push the button labeled Hold.</p>
<p style="margin-left: 48px;">"Manual" indicates the user has manually entered a value in the Next Invoice Retainage field and tabbed out of the field. No button is required for this option</p>
<p style="margin-left: 48px;"><img src="image/ReleaseAllRetainage.gif" alt="image\ReleaseAllRetainage.gif" title="image\ReleaseAllRetainage.gif" width="94" height="28" border="0" /> Clicking the ‘’Release All button sets the Retainage % to zero and computes:</p>
<p style="margin-left: 88px;">Next Inv. Retainage = (Retainage Invoiced-to-Date)x(-1)</p>
<p style="margin-left: 88px;">This action would normally occur at the end of the job when it’s time to send the final bill: the word ‘Normal’ will appear next to the Next Inv. Retainage field.</p>
<p><font style="font-weight: bold;">Invoice Description</font><br />
This field defaults from the Billing Item record. As many lines of the Invoice Description will be printed on the invoice as are provided for in your invoice format. The first line of this field will also appear on the AR Customer History report. Any changes that you make to the Invoice Description here will be copied to the Invoice Description in the Job Billing Item record.</p>
<h3>8.6.5 Main Tab</h3>
<p style="font-weight: bold;">New Button:</p>
<p><img src="NewOther.bmp" alt="" style="border: none;" border="0" /></p>
<p>This enhancement allows the user to create and edit documents other that those defined as RFI, Submittal, Transmittal or RFQ's. When this button is clicked, the system will open a browser to a directory (defined via registry) containing one or more Word templates that may contain the same "tokens" used for RFI, Submittal, Transmittal and RFQ templates.</p>
<p>A copy of the selected document template will opened, with the appropriate values (from the data entry screen and Job-related records) already completed. The document may be edited as needed. SAMPro will automatically save an archive copy of the document when it is closed. This document may be accessed from the Other tab, and is also attached to the Job record.</p>
<p>The following registry option is required to implement this functionality:</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: bold;">Registry Id:</span> sys-viewer-vjbpm</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: bold;">Setting Key:</span> newTemplateOtherDirectory <span style="font-weight: bold;">Setting Value:</span> pathtodirectory</p>
<h3>8.6.6 New Tab - Other</h3>
<p style="font-weight: bold;">Number – Sent - Description – Recipient – Requested - Received – Document Id</p>
<p>This tab displays all Other documents generated for this Job via the New Other button. You may double-click on a line to display the Other Document. Note that the Requested and Received fields are reserved for</p>
<p>To edit selected fields for the selected document, right click on the line. When you do so, a data-entry box will appear prompting you to ‘Enter new values’. The following fields will appear:</p>
<p><font style="font-weight: bold;">Description:</font> (Briefly describes the Document on the tab – may be updated by the user)</p>
<p><font style="font-weight: bold;">Contact Id:</font> (the Contact for this Document).</p>
<p><font style="font-weight: bold;">Document Description:</font> (Used in the SAM Pro document record associated with this file)</p>
<p>Click <font style="font-weight: bold;">OK</font> to confirm the changes that you have made in this box; click <font style="font-weight: bold;">CANCEL</font> to abandon these changes.</p>
<h2>8.7 Job Costing Rate Calculation</h2>
<p style="margin-left: 8px;">This release corrects a issue that occurred if an employee was set up with a four-figure hourly earnings base: when hours for this employee were written to Job History, the Unit Cost was truncated. This release prevents truncation during intermediate calculations.</p>

<h2>9.2 Reports</h2>
<h3>9.2.1 GL Report Range Screen</h3>
<p style="font-weight: bold;">New Field: Commentary|<br />
<span style="font-weight: normal;">This text box has been added to the range settings screen displayed when a GL User Report is run. This text box allows up to 400 characters. The contents of this text box will be displayed at the top of each page of the generated report. If the report definition includes a 'First Page Text' field, the new Commentary box will appear below the First Page Text Box. This release supports saving the contents of the Commentary field as a saved range.</span></p>
<h3>9.2.2 Report GL History by Account:</h3>
<p style="font-weight: normal;">The revised report (DGLHSTRY.rpt) dated 05/14/2014 corrects an obscure query issue. &#160;</p>
<h3>9.2.3 Report Bank Reconciliation (RBNKRECN.rpt)</h3>
<p>The revised report dated 2015-08-06 supports the Bank Deposit enhancement implemented in v8.2 545.073 where edited Bank Deposit transactions are saved with a tack number appended to the Bank Deposit Transaction Id.</p>
<h3>9.2.4 Crystal Bank Deposit Reports</h3>

To do this, enter the character to be used for the underlining (usually "-" or "=") in the - (Underline) field for the EndTot line.</p>
<h3><span style="font-weight: bold;">9.2.6 Report Journal Listing GL Entries</span></h3>
<p style="margin-left: 8px;">The revised report (RGLJRNL.rpt) dated 2016-12-16 fixes a sporadic issue where the GL Journal "total debits" and "total credits" amount within the GL Journal viewer did not match what is on the RGLJRNL report totals. &#160;</p>
<h2>9.3 GL Entity</h2>
<h3>9.3.1 Intercompany Processing</h3>
<p>In addition to the GL Entities defined for profit centers, if Intercompany Processing (see user release note 1.1) is implemented, a GL Entity should be defined for use in Due T/’Due From transactions. This type of Entity will be reference on the Company record’s GL Tab in the Balance Sheet Default GL Entity field.</p>
<p><font style="font-weight: bold;">New Field: Company Id</font><br />
This field must be completed if Intercompany Processing is implemented (the sys-ffv-global-settings registry’s IntercompanyEnabled option is set to true).</p>
<h3>9.3.2 New Tab: Entity Groups</h3>
<p>This display tab lists all GL Entity Groups which include this GL Entity. &#160;Double-clicking on a line opens the selected GL Entity Group.</p>
<h2>9.4 GL Account</h2>
<h3>9.4.1 Intercompany Processing</h3>
<p>If Intercompany Processing (see user release note 1.1) is implemented a ‘Due To’ Asset account and a ‘Due From’ Liability account should be created for each Company record. A good technique for the Due to and Due From GL accounts is to create a root account with the company extension (i.e. DUE TO 1200-A for company A and 1200-B for company B …).</p>
<h2>9.5 GL Journal</h2>
<h3>9.5.1 New GLH Tab</h3>
<p>This release Implements a new GLH parent tab in journals that post to GL History. This tab displays the GL History postings associated with the selected transaction. The following columns appear on this tab:</p>
<p style="margin-left: 36.00pt;">Account - Account Name - Entity<br />
Period – Company - Security<br />
I/C (Yes if this post was generated by Intercompany Processing, No if not)<br />
Journal - Trx Id – Date - Trx Count</p>
<h2>9.6 Bank Reconciliation Journal</h2>
<p>This release improves performance toggling detail lines.</p>
<p style="margin-left: 8px;">Validation now denies a change to the GL Account or Entity fields when the viewer is not in Add mode.</p>
<p style="margin-left: 8px;">If the viewer is in Add mode, changing the GL Account and/or Entity fields will automatically clear all child lines; &#160;this forces the user to Auto-Fill for the currently selected GL Account/Entity combination.</p>
<p>The system now validates that the Accounting Period is Active before allowing the user to continue with the reconciliation.</p>
<h2>9.7 GL Reporting Period</h2>
<p style="margin-left: 8px;"><span id="BugEvents27211">Validation has been added to ensure the End Date does NOT precede the Start Date when the record is saved.</span></p>
<h2>9.8 Bank Deposit Journal</h2>
<p>Validation now ensures that edits to this journal are never allowed in a closed accounting period.&#160;&#160;When an unreconciled Bank Deposit Journal entry is accessed, the user is warned if the Accounting Period is closed, and that Reversing entries will take the Effective Date and Accounting period assigned to the new transactions. When the user changes the Effective Date and Accounting Period and saves the entry, the system writes the reversal AND forwarding transactions to the current period.</p>
<p>The new transaction will be saved with a tack number (01,02, ...) appended to the Bank Deposit Transaction Id.</p>
<p>Validation prevents Bank Deposit Journal entries from being deleted if the Accounting Period is inactive.</p>
<p>Corrects a display issue in the List view which allowed the contents of the selected record to peak through the bottom pane of the list.</p>
<h2>9.9 Bank Transfer Journal</h2>
<p>Refined validation checks reconciliation of header and detail GL Account / Entities entries separately. Also prevents changes when the Reconciliation Journal has changed while the Transfer Journal is being edited.</p>
<p>Validation prevents Bank Transfer Journal entries from being deleted if the Accounting Period is inactive.</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: bold;">New Fields: Parent</span><br />
<span style="font-weight: bold;">Company Id:</span><br />
This field will be completed by the system if Intercompany Security is implemented.</p>
<p style="font-weight: bold;">New Fields - Transfers From Tab</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: bold;">Company:</span><br />
Specifies the Company the Transfer is from if Intercompany Security is enabled.</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: bold;">Recon Id: Recon Date:</span><br />
The Bank Reconciliation Transaction Id and Date for this line.</p>
<h2>9.10 GL History</h2>
<p>The glhstry.glhstry_rfrnce_wrkordr_rn column was added to the database for version 8.2. &#160;The following journals now support writing to this field if applicable:</p>
<p style="margin-left: 48px;">AP Journal: Inventory, General, Subs, Material Returns<br />
AR Sales Journal: Parent, Prices, Costs<br />
Labor Journal: Hours, Other<br />
Job Journal: Labor, Expenses, Co. Equipment<br />
Purchase Orders: Inventory, General, Unvouchered<br />
Inventory Receipts: Receipts<br />
Inventory Adjustments Journal: From/Adj, To<br />
Work Orders: Labor, Inventory, Other</p>
<h2>9.11 GL Entity Group</h2>
<p><span style="font-weight: bold;">Changed Field: Company Id:</span><br />
This enhancement concerns Intercompany users only. Although a specific Company Id may only be associated with one GL Entity Group, other GL Entity Groups may be desired for GL Reporting purposes. In previous releases, creating these GL Entity Groups was difficult because double-clicking in the GL Entity tab displayed an empty list because only GL Entities with a blank Company Id (matching the blank Company Id in the Entity Group) appeared. In this release, all &#160;GL Entities will be displayed when the user double-clicks on a GL Entity Id.</p>
<h2>9.12 Job EOM Processing</h2>
<p style="margin-left: 8px;">In this release, if the user clicks the GO button more than once, the message 'The GO button should only be clicked once; multiple clicks are ignored.' is displayed and the Job EOM data are posted only once.</p>

<h2>10.4 Start Create Rental Billing</h2>
<p>This new function is used to generate rental billings associated with Assets as a Rental Invoice type Work Order. Rental billings are defined by the presence of an Asset Id on the Client Site PM Billing Tab. Unlike PM invoices, the Rental revenue is written to the WO-Other Tab, not the WO-RevAdjust Tab.</p>
<p>This function generates Rental Invoices from the Client Site PM Billing tab. The Asset Id must be complete in the PM Billing line for it to be eligible for Rental Billing.</p>
<p><font style="font-weight: bold;">Create</font> <font style="font-weight: bold;">Rental</font> <font style="font-weight: bold;">Billing Spreadsheet</font></p>
<p>When this function is run, the system generates a .cvs file listing the results of this function into the directory specified by the dbreportfiles registry option. It will list the following information:</p>
<p>Bill Date - Amount Billed - Amount Earned - Site Name - Site Id - Invoice Description - Invoice Id</p>
<p>Billing entries that include only the amortization of the revenue are listed at the beginning of the report, and will be indicated as such.</p>
<h3>Important Fields: Initial Screen</h3>
<p><font style="font-weight: bold;">Period Id:</font><br />
Enter an active Accounting Period Id (or double-click to select from a list.). This function validates that the selected Accounting Period is "active" and that Start &amp; End Dates selected are BOTH valid dates within the Accounting Period.</p>

<p><font style="font-weight: bold;">Client Site Id:</font><br />
If you only wish to generate Rental Invoices for a specific site enter the appropriate Client Site Ids).</p>
<p><font style="font-weight: bold;">Branch Id</font><br />
To only create Rental Invoices for specific branches, enter the Branch Id.</p>
<p><font style="font-weight: bold;">Project Id:<br /></font>If you only wish to generate Rental Invoices for Jobs associated with a specific Project, enter the appropriate Project Ids).</p>
<h3>Important Fields: Checklist Screen</h3>
<p>This checklist appears after you click the Go button in the initial Create Rental Billing function screen. It enables you to verify which scheduled Rental Billings will be invoiced.</p>

<h1>11 Payroll</h1>
<h2>11.1 Registry</h2>
<h3>11.1.1 Generate Recurring Labor Entries – Registry to Allow Zero Hour Lines</h3>
<p>By default, labor lines entered on the Employee Recurring Wages Tab with zero hours are skipped by this function. Since some clients wish to use these lines to enter extra compensation (bonus amounts), the following registry has been enabled to allow zero hour lines to be processed.</p>
<p><font style="font-weight: bold;">Registry Id:</font> sys-start-Spstrcrrnglbr</p>
<p><font style="font-weight: bold;">Setting Key:</font> AllowZeroHourLines <font style="font-weight: bold;">Setting Value:</font> true (default false)</p>
<h3>11.1.2 Enable Post History Processing&#160;(for ADP users)</h3>
<p>The Post History button (in the Payroll Period) should only be enabled for payroll service users who export data, but do not print and post checks.&#160;&#160;If you use the Post History function, you cannot print a paycheck for employees impacted by the post for the selected Payroll Period.</p>
<p>The new process replaces the print/post check functionality to enable use of certain payroll reports that present valid information such as workers compensation. When run, it sets the Payroll History Date Effective to the Last Check Date from the Payroll Period, and the Source Journal to registry setting described below or ‘ADP Export’ if the registry is not present.</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: bold;">Registry Id:</span> sys-viewer-vpyrllprd</p>

<h5>Autosave PR Checks and Attach to Employee and Check Records</h5>
<p>This release includes an enhancement that supports the auto-saving of <span>Checks (including EFT checks) as attachments to the &#160;Employee and Check records when the Check is successfully posted. If the check is flagged as Reuse or Void during in the post, the check document will NOT be retained as a attachment. The following entries are required to enable this functionality.</span></p>

<p>We recommend that the auto-attached version of the check indicates that it is a copy, not the original. If the report is auto-saved as a pdf when it is first printed, it does not invoke the copystampbitmap functionality as when you bring up a dbr report. For this reason, the following graphics should be created to ensure that the attached PDF document is noted as a copy.</p>
<p style="text-indent: -.25in;"><span style="mso-list: Ignore; mso-fareast-font-family: Calibri; mso-bidi-font-family: Calibri;">1</span><span style="mso-fareast-font-family: Calibri; mso-bidi-font-family: Calibri; mso-list: Ignore;">.&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;1.</span> <span style="mso-list: l0 level1 lfo1;">The bitmap this registry references either includes the logo you want on the real check, or all white if the printed check doesn’t need it (just a placeholder), or is absent.&#160;</span></p>

Create a .</span><span style="mso-list: l0 level1 lfo1;">jpg (or have Data-Basics do this for you) &#160;that corresponds in name to the bitmap referenced in this registry. &#160;It should include whatever logo, COPY text, etc. you want to appear on the saved PDF.&#160;&#160;Within the graphic, you may wish to place the text COPY in the check position of the report; using a font size of at least 80 points and 50% gray (so that text on the report will show through the report).</span></p>
<h5>Password-Protected PDFs for Report PR Check</h5>
<p>An updated XmlToPdf.jar file (dated 1/16/2014 and the following registry entry(ies) are required to implement this behavior. &#160;This functionality is currently only enabled for Report PR Check and Report Employee Timesheet. &#160;The PR Check report uses the last 6 digits of the employee SSN as the SectionUserPassword when Password Protection is enabled.</p>
<p>Note that the registry must also include the applicable autosave (or autosavewhenprinted), autosavefilename, and autosavedirectory entries for the password protection to be enabled .&#160;&#160;In addition, the autosavefiletype option MUST be set to PDF (Setting Key: autosavefiletype&#160;&#160;Setting Value: PDF).</p>
<p>Registry Id: sys-report-rprchck (be sure to implement for all Branch and or Security entries)</p>
<p>The following option is required to enable password protection</p>

<h3>11.1.4 &#160;ADP PRS Code Enhancements and Export Registry</h3>
<h5>PRS Code Support for ADP</h5>
<p>This release supports the use of the PRS Code fields in the Pay Type and Other Rate records for the &#160;ADP Export. Note that if your system is already set up with the ADP Codes in the User 1 fields it is not necessary to complete the PRS fields. IMPORTANT: TechAnywhere also uses the PRS Codes/User 1: do NOT change your setup with consulting your TechAnywhere and SAMPro support reps.</p>

<h5>Export Registry for ADP</h5>
<p>This modification was developed for specific customers and should NOT be used without first discussing with your SAMPro support rep. &#160;Requires the user to review all Pay Types for Regular and Overtime (hours worked) and change the Hours type for 'Other' to 'Worked' and change the category from 'Other' to 'Regular' or 'Overtime'. After editing these Pay Types, this registry option is added so the ADP export will continue to extract Regular and OT Hours as Hours 3 Amount (prints as Other Hours on the report) but allows the Labor Journal to dispaly the correct Recap totals by Category / Hours Type.</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: bold;">Registry Id:</span> sys-adp-export:</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: bold;">Setting Key:</span> ReclassifyRegOTHours &#160;&#160;&#160;<span style="font-weight: bold;">Setting Value:</span> true &#160;(default is false)</p>

<h3>11.2.4 Revised Report PR Employee Wage Analysis:</h3>
<p>The revised report RPRWAGE.rpt dated 7/19/2013 has been enhanced to support Canadian installations by using the SIN (along with the US SSN) when grouping / sorting the report.</p>
<h3>11.2.5 Positive Pay - Fifth Third Bank</h3>
<p>This release includes an internal formatting change to support sending of the Payee Name.</p>
<h3>11.2.6 Report PR Checks</h3>
<p>See Customer Release Note 11.1.3 for registries to auto-save a password-protected .PDF copy of the Payroll Check to the Employee record.</p>
<p>This version corrects a problem in recent releases where the check number in the MICR format was off one from the check number printed in the body of the check.</p>
<p>This version implements Security filtering when PR checks are printed so that the check run excludes employees whose Security Id does not match the Security Id of the user running Report PR Checks.</p>
<p>Validation prevents the user from closing the Payroll Check Checklist (which appears the Prints is confirmed) by clicking the Windows Red X, abandoning the check run. If the user clicks the Red X, he will be informed that "This process cannot be canceled." &#160;After clearing the message box by clicking Ok, the user must then choose to Post, Reuse or Void the checks, and then click Go.</p>
<h5>11.2.6a I<span style="font-weight: bold;">ntercompany Processing of PR Checks</span></h5>
<p>If the DefaultGLBankAccount option is set in sys-report-rprchck-<span style="font-style: italic;"><i>securityid,</i></span> the GL Bank Account specified in the registry now defaults when the user selects the Company (or it defaults if only one Company has been specified in the database).

<h3>11.2.7 Report PR Worksheet (RPRWRKSv73b041.rpt) (U.S. Payroll)</h3>
<p class="MsoNormal">The Additional Medicare Tax statute requires U.S. employers to withhold Additional Medicare Tax on wages it pays to an employee in excess of $200,000 in a calendar year. For SAMPro users, this requires adding the FICA MCAD Tax Table to an Employee's Tax tab when he/she is projected to exceed $200,000 in the next payroll (NOT before).</p>
<p class="MsoNormal">The revised PR Worksheet report (dated 06/04/2014) includes a new input field, FICA MC Wage Threshold. &#160;When this field is completed, the following warning will appear in the report in red, bold text if the threshold is exceeded:</p>
<p class="Support">*** YTD FICA MC WAGES OF $ (employee's wages) HAVE EXCEEDED THE WAGE THRESHOLD of $ (value entered on input field) ***</p>
<p class="MsoNormal">Remember, the <span style="font-family: Arial, sans-serif;">table FICA MCAD should not be added to the Employee's Tax Tab UNTIL the employee is going to breach the 200K threshold.</span> This report is suitable for version 7.3 and above.</p>
<p class="MsoNormal">A registry setting may be used to set the report's FICA MC Wage Threshold input field to either the $200,000 or a lesser value (to provide a warning before the next paycheck or bonus is generated). &#160;</p>
<p class="MsoNormal"><span style="font-weight: bold;">Registry Id:</span> sys-report-rprwrks</p>

<p class="MsoNormal" style="margin-left: 48px;">Setting Value: 200000 &#160;(to display when computed pay exceeds the US government threshold)</p>
<h3>11.2.8 &#160;Report Employee Timesheet</h3>
<h5 class="MsoNormal">Password-Protected PDFs for Report Employee Timesheet</h5>
<p>An updated XmlToPdf.jar file (dated 1/16/2014 and the following registry entry(ies) are required to implement this behavior. &#160;This functionality is currently only enabled for Report Employee Timesheet which may be used to send timesheet information to Employees, and for Report PR Check. &#160;This report uses the last 6 digits of the employee SSN as the SectionUserPassword when Password Protection is enabled.</p>
<p>Note that the registry must also include the applicable autosave (or autosavewhenprinted), autosavefilename, and autosavedirectory entries for the password protection to be enabled .&#160;&#160;In addition, the autosavefiletype option MUST be set to PDF (Setting Key: autosavefiletype&#160;&#160;Setting Value: PDF).</p>

<p><span style="font-weight: bold;">Setting Key:</span> SectionOwnerPassword &#160;&#160;<span style="font-weight: bold;">Setting Value:</span> <span style="font-style: italic;"><i>ownerpassword</i></span></p>
<p><span style="font-style: italic;"><i>A</i></span> default Owner password (for Data-Basics Support only) will be used unless one is set through this registry entry.</p>
<h3>11.2.9 Report PR Misc. Deduction Checks</h3>
<p>This release adds support for Security processing when checks are generated, The Security will also be set correctly in the Check record</p>
<p>When Intercompany is enabled, validation now ensures that a Company and GL Entity must be selected in order to run the report</p>
<p>This release <span style="font-weight: bold;">c</span>orrects a spurious 'error 207 Invalid Column Name' when PRMD check were printed. &#160;</p>
<p>Validation prevents the user from closing the Checklist (which appears after confirming the print) by clicking the Windows Red X, abandoning the check run. If the Red X is clicked, the message "This process cannot be canceled" appears.&#160;After clearing the message, the user must choose to Post, Reuse or Void the checks, and then click Go.</p>
<h3>11.2.10 &#160;Report PR Check Detail (RPRCHCKDTL.rpt)</h3>
<p>Employer-based taxes are no longer included In the revised report dated 2015-06-23 since this report is used as a ‘check stub’ for companies not printing actual checks when doing Direct Deposit.</p>
<p>This report (revised 11/18/2014) is designed primarily for installations who are using the SkipPrintEFTChecks option in sys-report-rprchck to allow for <span id="BugEvents3521">the display of PR EFT Checks but printing only the live checks.</span></p>
<p><span>This report was designed to provide stub information to employees who receive their pay via EFT, and who do not have access to the stubs via TimeAnywhere.</span></p>
<p>By default this report prints at the top of the page, but the Line Adjust option on the report range screen may be used to move the print down to allow your corporate logo / contact information to print. Including your logo / information will be useful to employees needing check stub information to apply for credit or other financial transactions. We strongly recommend using the InitialValueFor~ registry option to set the report's Line Adjustment field to the correct value each time it is run.</p>
<h5>Range Screen:</h5>
<p><font style="font-weight: bold;">Start Date: End Date:</font><br />

<h3>11.2.14 New Report PR W-2s (Standard) and Report PR W-3s (Standard)</h3>
<p style="font-weight: normal; mso-spacerun: yes;"><span style="mso-bidi-font-weight: normal;">The new</span> Report PR W-2s (Standard) and Report PR W-3s (Standard) do not require a <span style="mso-bidi-font-weight: normal;">printer that supports native PCL printing with a PCL 5 or 5c printer driver. These report may required some changes to your existing registry entries, but are much simpler to run. If you still have the same printer / printer driver that you used for your W2’s last year, you may use the old version of Report PR W-2.</span></p>
<p class="MsoNormal"><b style="mso-bidi-font-weight: normal;"><span style="mso-bidi-font-weight: normal;">S</span>tep 1.</b> Once the new version has been installed, run Start Function List Update to add the new reports (Report PR W-2s (Standard) and Report PR W-3s (Standard) to the Report menu.</p>
<p class="MsoNormal"><b style="mso-bidi-font-weight: normal;">Step 2.</b> Go to the User Group (versions 9.0 and 9.1) or User Groups and Functions (version 8.2) record for the users who will run these reports and give them access to the new reports. <span style="mso-spacerun: yes;">&#160;</span>They must log off and back on to access the reports.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes;">&#160;</span>&#160;Note that if you are running under User Group All you must also log off and on to run the new reports.</p>
<p class="MsoNormal"><b style="mso-bidi-font-weight: normal;">Step 3.</b><span style="mso-spacerun: yes;">&#160;</span>&#160;The new Report PR W-2s (Standard) and Report PR W-3 (Standard) use the same registries as the old reports – review or create these registries as needed:</p>

<p class="MsoNormal" style="margin-left: 1.0in;">Tip: <span style="mso-spacerun: yes;">&#160;</span>Most printers require negative margin adjustments for the new Report PR W-2s (Standard).<span style="mso-spacerun: yes;">&#160;</span>&#160;We recommend starting with the following settings and adjust as needed following your alignment print:</p>
<p class="MsoNormal" style="margin-left: 1.0in;"><b style="mso-bidi-font-weight: normal;">Id:</b> sys-printer-w2<br />
<b style="mso-bidi-font-weight: normal;">Setting Key:</b> marginx&#160;&#160;<b style="mso-bidi-font-weight: normal;">Setting Value:</b> -0.05<br />

<p class="MsoNormal" style="margin-left: 1.5in;"><b style="mso-bidi-font-weight: normal;">Reminder:</b> Negative margin setting values move the report text closer to the upper left-hand corner.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes;">&#160;</span>&#160;Setting values without the negative sign move the report text to the right (marginx) and down (marginy).</p>
<p class="MsoNormal" style="margin-left: 1.0in;">Note: it is not necessary to specify a default printer in this registry if you are using the new Report PR W-2s (Standard) report.</p>
<p class="MsoNormal" style="margin-left: .5in;"><b style="mso-bidi-font-weight: normal;">New Registry for W3 Printer</b></p>
<p class="MsoNormal" style="margin-left: .5in;">The following registry may be used to specify margin adjustments on the W-3 if they are different from the W-2. Most printers require negative margin adjustments for the new Report PR W-3s (Standard).<span style="mso-spacerun: yes;">&#160;</span>&#160;We recommend starting with the following settings and adjusting as needed following your alignment print:</p>
<p class="MsoNormal" style="margin-left: 1.0in;"><b style="mso-bidi-font-weight: normal;">Id:</b> sys-printer-w3<br />

You will be prompted to run the W-3 (see the W3 Printing Tip below), although Report PR W-3s (Standard) may be also be run stand-alone.</p>
<p class="MsoNormal">Make any adjustments needed to the horizontal or vertical positions via the sys-printer-W2 and/or sys-printer-W3 registries and recheck for alignment as needed.</p>
<p class="MsoNormal"><b style="mso-bidi-font-weight: normal;">Step 5.</b> Once you are happy with your alignment, run the necessary copies of your W-2 and W-3 forms (see Help for details).</p>
<p class="MsoNormal" style="margin-left: .5in;"><b style="mso-bidi-font-weight: normal;">W3 Printing Tips:<br /></b>The Copy A option of Report PR W-2s (Standard) allows the printing of a W3 form at the end of the report. The system will print the Copy A’s and summary page as usual, and then pause. The following message box will appear:</p>
<p class="MsoNormal" style="margin-left: 1.0in;">&#160;Print W3 Form? Insert W3 Form Now.</p>
<p class="MsoNormal" style="margin-left: .5in;">If you want to print the W3, DO NOT RESPOND TO THIS MESSAGE IMMEDIATELY. To print the W3 form, the user should verify that all Copy A’s plus the summary page have been printed, and then load the W3 form in the printer.</p>
<p class="MsoNormal" style="margin-left: .5in;">After the W3 form has been loaded, the user should then click Yes in the message box to display and then print the W3 form. Note that if taxes for more than one state have been assessed, an X will be printed in the State portion of Box 15, and the Employer’s state ID number will be blank.</p>

<p>Time may also be approved from the Work Order Revenue tab by right-clicking on a line. No special user attribute is required: all that is needed is for someone other than the tech to ‘touch’ the entry.</p>
<p>Three registry entries are required for this functionality: please see user note 17.1 for details: one to split TechAnywhere time into separate labor journals by work order, and another two to allow approval in the Work Order and Labor Journals.</p>
<h2>11.4 CPP Time Import</h2>

<p><span id="BugEvents2711">In this release, validation ensures that the Payroll Period End Date does NOT precede the Payroll Period Start Date when the record is saved.&#160;&#160;The system also validates that the Check End Date does not precede the Check Start Date. Note that it is not an error when the Start Date and End Date are the same.</span></p>
<p><span>V</span>alidation also ensures the Start and End Check dates are both within the payroll Year.</p>
<h3>11.7.1 Post History Button</h3>
<p><img src="Post_History.bmp" alt="" style="border: none;" border="0" /></p>
<p>This button should only be enabled (via the registry entry in Customer Note 11.1.2) &#160;for payroll service users who export data, but do not print and post checks.&#160;&#160;If you use the Post History function, you cannot print a paycheck for employees impacted by the post for the selected Payroll Period.</p>
<p>The new process replaces the print/post check functionality to enable use of certain payroll reports that present valid information such as workers compensation. When run, it sets the Payroll History Date Effective to the Last Check Date from the Payroll Period, and the Source Journal to registry setting described below or ‘ADP Export’ if the registry is not present.</p>
<h3>11.7.2 &#160;New Tab: Hours</h3>
<p>The Hours Tab is filtered based on the User's Executive PR and Branch Filter fields. Data for Executive Payroll Employees (Executive P/R flagged in the Employee record) will only be displayed if the Executive PR? box is checked in their User record. Filtering based on the User's Branch Filter only comes into play when the hard-block filtering option is turned on via registry.</p>
<p style="font-weight: bold;">Employee - Regular – Overtime – Dbl Time Holiday – Vacation – Sick – Other – Total</p>
<p>These fields indicate the number of hours recorded for each employee for this Payroll Period.</p>
<p style="font-weight: bold;">Status:</p>
<p>The Status of each line is determined for each employee as follows:</p>
<p style="margin-left: 48px;">&#160;**ERRORS**: errors prevented Compute Payroll from being run successfully for this employee</p>
<p style="margin-left: 48px;">*NOT COMPUTED*: Compute Payroll has not yet been run for this employee.</p>
<p style="margin-left: 48px;">*UNPOSTED*: Payroll has been computed successfully, but either a pay check has not been posted, or the Post History button has not been used to post history.&#160;</p>
<p style="margin-left: 48px;">Check #: This pay check was printed and posted in SAMPro.</p>
<p style="margin-left: 48px;">The Status column shows the 'PostSourceDescription' value for exports to a payroll service &#160;when none of the other options apply.&#160;</p>
<h2>11.8 PR Tax Authority</h2>
<p style="margin-left: 8px;">In this release, the Max FIT Allowance and the Max FICA Allowance are considered if Allow FIT or Allow FICA are enabled in the Tax Authority. Previously the system allowed the ENTIRE Federal tax.</p>
<p style="margin-left: 8px;">Correct a spurious "asUpperCase Not Understood" error when the All State box (in Allowances for Other Deductions) is checked. &#160;</p>
<h2>11.9 &#160;New Function: Start Compute Overtime</h2>
<h3>11.9.1 Purpose:</h3>
<p>The basic premise of this enhancement is that hourly time is entered as regular time, and this function is run to generate and Overtime Premium for 'excess' hours over a regular work week BEFORE running Compute Payroll. &#160;The Overtime Premium is assessed to an overhead Job.</p>
<p>Start Compute Overtime's purpose is to compute each employee's Excess Regular Hours and make a new Labor Journal to reclassify the excess regular hours as Overtime Hours. By definition 'Regular Hours' is the number of hours an employee has WORKED in the Pay Period in excess of a 'normal' work week.&#160;&#160;The process that accumulates this number has the following requirements:</p>
<p style="margin-left: 48px;">Pay Type's Hours Type = Worked</p>
<p style="margin-left: 48px;">Pay Type's Category = Regular</p>
<p style="margin-left: 48px;">Hours are NOT part of the Employee's salary</p>
<p style="margin-left: 48px;">Employee must have Total Direct Hours &gt; zero for the period</p>
<p style="margin-left: 8px;">Each employee's Excess Regular Hours are reclassified as overtime in a new Labor Journal entry; the Labor Journal Description will be set to *** Overtime Adjustment ***.</p>
<h3>11.9.2 Usage:</h3>
<p style="margin-left: 8px;">If Branches exist in your database, the corresponding sys-start-scmpteovrtme-<span style="font-style: italic;"><i>branchid</i></span> registry entries must be generated in order for this function to be run. The employee's branch is used to determine which job / costcode / costcategory gets the OT Premium charge, regardless of which direct jobs were charged originally. &#160;</p>
<p style="margin-left: 8px;">During the second phase, the compute payroll process allocates the OT Premium back to those same direct jobs.</p>
<h3>11.9.3 Registry Entries Required for Start Compute Overtime</h3>
<p style="margin-left: 8px;">This registry specifies which overhead Job / Cost Code / Cost Category get the Overtime Premium charge based on the Employee's Branch (if specified). &#160;If Branches are enabled on your system, a registry entry must be created for each Branch, plus one without a Branch Id if some employees eligible for an Overtime Premium do not have a Branch specified in their record.</p>

<span style="font-weight: normal;">This column lists the total hours of all types recorded for the specified Payroll Period.</span></p>
<p style="margin-left: 8px; font-weight: bold;">Excess:<br />
<span style="font-weight: normal;">The Excess hours worked for this Payroll Period. By definition 'Regular Hours' is the number of hours an employee has WORKED in the Pay Period in excess of a 'normal' work week (e.g., 40 hours if the employee is paid weekly, or 80 hours if the employee has 26 pay periods per year).</span></p>
<p style="margin-left: 8px;">Click the Go button to generate the Overhead Adjustment Labor Journal entry.</p>
<h3>11.9.6 &#160;Changes to Compute Payroll to Support Compute Overtime</h3>
<p style="margin-left: 8px;">A result of reclassifying the excess regular hours, is the creation of a new overhead expense equal to the amount of each employee's Overtime Premium Pay.&#160;&#160;For example, assume an employee making $20 per hour had 8 excess regular hours in the period.&#160;&#160;The overtime premium would be computed as follows ...<br />
<br />
&#160;&#160;($20 x 8 hours x 1.5) - ($20 x 8 hours) = $80.<br />
<br />
The modified Compute Payroll process now takes the Overtime Premium Pay and distributes it across the various non-overhead jobs charged during the period.&#160;&#160;Using the above example, assume the employee worked 33 hours on Direct Job A, 11 hours on Direct Job B and 4 hours on an Overhead Job.&#160;&#160;Using the 44 (33 + 11) direct hours as a base, the OT Premium would get allocated as follows ...<br />
<br />
&#160;&#160;Job A: $80 x (33 / 44) = $60<br />
&#160;&#160;Job B: $80 x (11 / 44) = $20<br />
<br />
NOTE: The actual distribution is made by Job, Cost Code, Billing Item, Cost Category, Labor Rate, Earnings Group, Pay Type, GL Entity, Work Order and Date Worked.</p>
<h2>11.10 Employee Viewer</h2>
<p>The Date field on the Employee Checks Tab now displays **ERRORS** if errors prevented Compute Payroll from being run successfully for the employee.</p>
<h2><span style="font-weight: bold;">11.11 Compute Payroll</span></h2>
<p style="margin-left: 8px;">Fixes residual tax credit calculations for annualized-type tables.</p>
<p style="margin-left: 8px;">This release corrects a rounding problem with OT Premium Allocations. &#160;</p>
<p style="margin-left: 8px;">This function now handles negative amounts from previous tax allocation values. This corrects a very sporadic &#160;"Runtime error: illegal character in format" issue.</p>
<p style="margin-left: 8px;">Corrects a PR Fringe Allocation-to-JCH rounding issue.</p>
<h2>11.12 Generate Recurring Labor</h2>
<p>This release corrects row locking issues caused by this function.</p>
<p>This release corrects an error that could occur if the user cleared / rechecked entries in the checklist screen.</p>
<h2>11.13 &#160;CPP Expense Import (new Starter function)</h2>
<p>The new Start CPP Expense Import function enables the user to import payroll expenses such as mileage from a spreadsheet (.CSV) provided by Complete Payroll Processing into the Labor Journal's Other tab. Unlike the CPP Time Import, expenses are imported to a Job, not a Work Order.</p>
<h3>Usage:</h3>
<p>The Starter function allows a user to browse to a CPP populated .csv formatted file, open the file and have its contents imported into a data edit screen for review, possible correction and import into the Labor Journal. &#160;</p>
<p>When this function is run, it will attempt to derive the appropriate, Payroll Period based on the Effective Date in the .CVS file. &#160;If an active Payroll Period is found which includes the Effective Date, the system will use it to generate the Labor Journal entries. &#160;If there is not an active Payroll Period that includes the Effective Date, the message Invalid Pay Period will be displayed on the Create CCP Time Expense Entries screen.</p>
<p>Once imported, the expense data will be editable via the Labor Journal just like expenses manually entered into the Labor Journal's Other tab.</p>
<h3>IMPORT FILE SPECIFICATION:</h3>
<p>The file definition for the .csv (comma separated ASCII) file is as follows. The file should NOT include a header row.</p>
<p>Column 1: Quantity - 999.99 (required)<br />
Column 2: Effective Date- dd/mm/yy (required)<br />
Column 3: Amount (Total) Cost<br />
Column 4: Employee Id<br />
Column 5: Job Id<br />
Column 6: Job Cost Category Id<br />
Column 7: Job Cost Code Id<br />
Column 8: Other Rate Id</p>
<p>Any field that currently defaults when entering expenses into the Labor Journal but not specified in the file layout will continue to default based on current default rules.</p>

<p>The Revenue Adjustment Table allows you to define Labor, Material, Other and Subcontract adjustments, AND a Management Fee. The posting type of the Management Fee is determined by the Cost Category. In previous releases, the Sales Tax Type of the Management Fee was always set to n/a, regardless whether the Cost Category was taxable or not for the Quote or Work Order's Sales Tax Group. &#160;In this version, the following registry setting may be used to set the Revenue Adjustment Tax Types for Management Fees in both the Quote and the Work Order.</p>

<h3>12.1.6 Registry Entry to Set Qty Billed to Zero for Zero Dollar Fixed Fee Quote Lines</h3>
<p class="MsoNormal" style="margin-left: 0px;">When creating fixed fee quotes, the WO detail generated from the Approval Wizard will have a Qty Bill on all of the lines. Lines with a Qty Bill will appear on the invoice even though they are not marked as extra. &#160;The following registry may be enabled to set the Qty Bill to zero on Fixed Fee lines that are not flagged as when the Quote Master Wizard posts to the Work Order. <span style="font-weight: bold;">Note that this registry is enabled in the Work Order’s Registry, not the Quote’s.</span></p>

<h3>12.1.7 &#160;Specify Override Bitmap by Site's Account Manager, Service Manager, Dispatcher or Branch for Report Quote</h3>
<p>This release enables additional registry setting keys for sys-report-rqtefrm that provide additional bitmap control over and above that provided by the report registry hierarchy. When printing Quotes, the system will look at the Client Site record referenced in the Quote to find the appropriate record id to check for an override id match. If it is referenced in the registry, the override bitmap will be used. If an override bitmap is NOT specified, the system will use the standard bitmap (Setting Key: bitmap) specified in the registry. &#160;Not that this functionality applies only to the main bitmap, not the sectionbackerbitmap.</p>
<p>It your firm has multiple registry entries (e.g., by Security, Branch, Users, etc.) the additional registry override options must be added to each registry record.</p>
<p>The revised version of Report Quote Form (RQTEFRMv73b102.rpt) dated 9/15/2014 or later AND SAMPro Version 8.2.545.049 or higher are required to implement this functionality:</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: bold;">Id:</span> sys-report-rqtefrm</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: bold;">Setting Key:</span> BitmapOverrideBasedOn &#160;&#160;&#160;<span style="font-weight: bold;">Setting Value:</span> <span style="font-style: italic;"><i>FieldInClientSite</i></span></p>
<p>This option turns on the override behavior, and defines which record in the Client Site will be used to define the bitmap override. Valid values are:</p>
<p>accountmanager<br />
branch<br />
servicemanager<br />
dispatcher</p>
<p>Setting Key: <span style="font-style: italic;"><i>FieldInClientSite~RecordId</i></span> &#160;<span><font style="font-style: normal; font-weight: bold;">Setting Value:</font></span> <span style="font-style: italic;"><i>sharepath\bitmap.bmp</i></span></p>

<h2>12.2 Reports</h2>
<h3>12.2.1 Report Quote Form (Standard) <span style="font-weight: bold;">(RQTEFRMv73b102.rpt)</span></h3>
<p><span style="font-weight: normal;">The revised Quote report dated 2016-04-25 now supports the rounding of estimated sales tax by option. Previously, the estimated sales tax was truncated to the penny. This enhancement will not completely resolve the occasional differences between the Service Invoice sales tax and the estimated Quote tax, but will make the two calculations much more compatible.</span></p>
<h3>12.2.2 Report Quote Recap WO</h3>
<p>A new registry is available that will cause the Quote Approval wizard to auto-launch a new report that includes instructions for the Tech (from the Scope of Services) and a recap of Charges (dollar amounts not included) and PO's generated. The report range screen includes both the Quote Id and the Work Order Id as range fields; both of these two fields are pre-loaded with the appropriate values coming from the wizard.</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: bold;">Registry Id:</span> sys-viewer-vwrkordr &#160;&#160;(note setting is on the Work Order, not Quote Registry)</p>

<p style="font-weight: bold;">New Report: Report Quote Recap WO (RQTERCPWO.rpt)</p>
<p>The new report must be installed and assigned to the appropriate User Groups. &#160;</p>
<p>Note: this report may be also be run manually. Only Quoted which have been posted to a Work Order will appear on the report. &#160;If a Quote has posted to more that one Work Order, specifying only the Quote Id on the Report Range will result in all Quote/WO combinations appearing on the report.</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: bold;">Registry Id:</span> sys-report-rqtercpwo</p>
<p>If you wish to have this report saved as a document on the Work Order and Quote records, a registry setting for this report must be established. The following options will save the report &#160;when it is displayed, and set the Document to Tech Viewable. The report will be saved as a PDF (so that it can be viewed it from TechAnywhere).</p>

<p>This release corrects rounding issues on revenues on the Quote viewer.</p>
<p>This release corrects Tab Mismatch errors on the Quantity fields on the Material and Other tabs.</p>
<p>SAM Pro now supports Flat Rate quantities other than whole numbers to prevent a conflict with TechAnywhere.</p>
<p>This release corrects a problem in recent images where the extended value negative quantity detail lines was off by a penny, resulting in a Tab Mismatch error.</p>
<p>Validation has also been added to prevent the Vendor Id from being completed on negative quantity Inventory and Material lines when the Quote is saved/added.</p>
<p>The Work Code from the Quote viewer will be written to the Work Order header and Equipment lines when a new Work Order is generated.</p>
<p>A Work Order may now be used as the source Work Order on multiple Quotes.</p>
<h3>12.4.1 Quote List View</h3>
<p>A new sort order, QuotesBySiteAlpha, displays the following columns:</p>
<p style="margin-left: 48px;">Site Alpha - SubmittedBy - SalesRep - Estimator - Quote Id - WO Id - Description<br />
Date Opened - Expiration</p>
<p>The Estimator Id has been added to the QuoteByIdByWorkorder order of the Quote List View.</p>
<p>A new List View order has been added, QuoteByIdByWorkorderByScope. This view displays an individual line for each Scope Option and Status in the Quote.</p>
<h3>12.4.2 Quote Filter View</h3>
<p>A new Range, Estimator Id, has been added to the Quote Filter screen.</p>
<h3>12.4.3 Quote Main Tab</h3>
<p><span style="font-weight: bold;">Changed Field - Site Id:</span><br />
The Site may not be changed if the WO or Job are filled in, or if Scope lines referencing Equipment exist. This validation ensures that the Equipment referenced on the Scope belongs to the Site.</p>
<p style="font-weight: bold; margin-left: 48px;">TIP: Cloning A Quote<br />
<span style="font-weight: normal;">To Clone a Quote with this new validation, use the following procedure to change the Site after entering</span> new <span style="font-weight: normal;">in the Quote Id field to begin the process:</span></p>
<p style="margin-left: 88px;">1. Blank the WorkOrder Id and Job fields (if completed)<br />
2. Blank the Equipment Id in all Scope Lines.<br />
3. Enter the Site Id the new Quote is for.<br />
4. Enter the appropriate Equipment Id for that Site on all Scope lines.</p>
<p><font style="font-weight: bold;">Changed Button - Approve All;<br /></font>In previous releases, the Approve All button only worked on Open and Accepted Options. In this release, it also sets Printed options to Approved.</p>
<p><font style="font-weight: bold;">Changed Field -</font> <font style="font-weight: bold;">Estimator Id:<br /></font>The Estimator Id now defaults from the Quote's Job anytime the Job is changed/added.&#160;&#160;This includes both direct edits of the Quote's Job Id as well as any indirect methods for changing the Job Id ... for example, changing the Work Order Id.</p>
<h3>12.4.4 Quote Inventory Tab</h3>
<p><font style="font-weight: bold;">Changed Field: Inventory Id:<br /></font>The system now checks to see if a part has been superceded (the Superceded By field on the Inventory Other Tab is filled in). When a superseded part number is entered into this field, the system will alert the user that</p>
<p style="margin-left: 36.00pt;">Item A has been superceded by Item B. Use New Item?</p>
<p>It the user clicks Yes, the new part (B) will be returned to the field. If the user clicks No, part A (which has been superceded) will remain in the field.</p>
<h3>12.4.5 Quote Scope Tab</h3>
<p>A confirmation message has been added to ensure the proper use of the Create CO button for budget entries on Construction jobs.</p>
<p><img src="image/ImportDiagnostic.gif" alt="image\ImportDiagnostic.gif" title="image\ImportDiagnostic.gif" width="100" height="18" border="0" /></p>
<p style="font-weight: bold;">New button: Import Diagnostic Cost</p>
<p>The function of this button is to import all costs associated with the quote’s lead work order (or the work order you select) so that they may be presented on the quote being prepared to correct the diagnosed problem. A typical scenario would be:</p>
<p style="margin-left: 36.00pt;">A technician is sent on a service call. He diagnoses the problem, but the job is big enough to require a quote before proceeding.</p>
<p style="margin-left: 36.00pt;">The real time spent on the diagnosis is entered on the work order.</p>
<p style="margin-left: 36.00pt;">In the Quote, the tech’s work order is used as the lead work order.</p>
<p style="margin-left: 66.25pt;">Option 1 is created for the proposed work to be done.</p>
<p style="margin-left: 66.25pt;">Option 2 is added: the Import Diagnostic Costs button is clicked to import the time spent on the lead work order.</p>
<p style="margin-left: 36.00pt;">The Quote is printed for the customer, showing both the work to be done and the diagnostic work already incurred.</p>
<p style="margin-left: 66.25pt;">If Option 1 is accepted, the user approves Option 1, and declines Option 2. When the Approval wizard is run, the Option 1 charges will be added to the diagnostic charges already on the work order.</p>
<p style="margin-left: 66.25pt;">If Option 1 is declined, the user will mark Option 1 and Option 2 declined, closing the quote. The customer will be billed from the lead work order, which already includes the diagnostic charges.</p>
<p>Note that in both cases, the option for the diagnostic charges would be declined, so that they are not billed twice on the lead work order.</p>
<h3>12.4.6 Diagnostic Cost Wizard</h3>
<p style="font-weight: bold;">Purpose:</p>
<p>This function is invoked when click the Import Diagnostic Cost button on the Scope tab. When you do so, the system will automatically step you through the processes needed to import all costs associated with the quote’s lead work order (or the work order you select) so that they may be presented on the quote being prepared to correct the diagnosed problem.</p>
<p>The Wizard sets the Tax Type based on the Tax Group / Tax Status in the Quote record. This prevents the Wizard from failing if the Tax Type Id ' n/a' is encountered in any of the Job History lines being imported (the could occur if the Tax Type was reset via the Work Order button).</p>
<p style="font-weight: bold;">Important Buttons:</p>
<p>Each Wizard screen includes buttons on the lower margin.</p>
<p style="margin-left: 36.00pt;">The <font style="font-weight: bold;">Cancel</font> button should be clicked when to end the approval process.</p>
<p style="margin-left: 36.00pt;">The <font style="font-weight: bold;">Next</font> button should be clicked to continue the approval process and proceed to the next screen when you have verified that all the options in the current screen have been set correctly.</p>
<p style="margin-left: 36.00pt;">The <font style="font-weight: bold;">Back</font> button returns you to the previous screen.</p>
<p style="margin-left: 36.00pt;">The <font style="font-weight: bold;">Finish</font> button is displayed on the final Wizard screen. When you click it, the system will ask you to confirm the posting of lines to your work and purchase orders.</p>
<p style="font-weight: bold;">Approval Screens:</p>
<p style="margin-left: 36.00pt; font-weight: bold; text-decoration: underline;">Select Cost Default</p>
<p style="margin-left: 36.00pt;"><font style="font-weight: bold;">Workorder Id:<br /></font> This field defaults to the Quote’s lead work order.</p>
<p style="margin-left: 36.00pt;"><font style="font-weight: bold;">Equipment Id:<br /></font> This field defaults to the Equipment Id on the Scope line the wizard are launched from; it is display-only.</p>
<p style="margin-left: 36.00pt;"><font style="font-weight: bold;">Import All Costs ?<br /></font>By default, this field is blank: only those costs associated with the Equipment Id on the Scope tab will be imported. If the user sets checks this field, the wizard gets costs from all equipment from the source work order, including work order costs where the Equipment Id is blank.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">&#160;</p>
<h3>12.4.7 New Tab: Techs</h3>
<p>The Techs tab lists all Work Order Technician lines referenced by this Quote. When a line is right-clicked, a prompt appears displaying Work Order information. The Technician Status may be changed.</p>
<h3>12.4.8 Revenue Adjustments Tab</h3>
<p>The GL Entity now defaults from the Job Cost Code found in the Client Site Equipment referenced on the specified scope line.</p>
<h3>12.4.9 Flat Rate Import</h3>
<p>The Import Flat Rate Wizard now supports Inventory Item superceding. I<span id="BugEvents321">f an item on the Flat Rate has been superceded, it is now automatically replaced by the current part during the import.</span></p>
<p>When a Flat Rate Category is selected and its fixed fee amounts are blank, the system now passes the labor, material and inventory lines thru the mark-up method specified in the Quote header (Rate Schedule Id, Gross Margin Percent, or Markup Percent).</p>
<h3>12.4.9a Flat Rate Import Enhancement</h3>
<p>The Flat Rate Import Wizard has been enhanced to allow the user to adjust the Unit Cost and specify a Vendor Id on the Inventory and Materials screen so they will be imported into the appropriate child tables of the Quote.</p>
<h3>12.4.10 Gross Margin Tab</h3>
<p style="margin-left: 8px;">This release eliminates the spurious 'Required Field: Cost Cat: Not Filled In' messages that could appear when filtering by option code.</p>
<p style="margin-left: 8px;"><img src="SKIN1_RefreshGM.bmp" alt="" style="border: none;" align="left" border="0" />Click this new button to update the Gross Margin Tab with data entered on the Quote since it was last saved.</p>
<h2>12.5 QuoteMaster Approval Wizard</h2>
<p style="margin-left: 8px;">Previously, Work Orders generated from the Approval Wizard were only put on Credit Hold if the Site or Client was flagged as Credit Hold. If the Days Credit Hold or Credit Limit in the &#160;Client are exceeded, new Work Orders generated from Quote Approval Wizard are now put on Credit Hold. If the Days Credit Hold is blank in the Client this piece of the credit checking is ignored to be in line with New Call processing.</p>
<p style="margin-left: 8px;">Corrects a problem in PO generation when one PO was updated and one was created for the same Vendor.</p>
<p style="margin-left: 8px;">Corrects a problem generating PO's when the user switches security. &#160;</p>
<p>Corrects a recent error that resulted in the Approval Wizard failing to post Material or Subcontract lines to a Purchase Order if the Equipment was flagged 'Deny TA Access'.</p>
<p>The Job information specified in the Quote Approval Wizard is ALWAYS used when lines are posted to the Work Order / PO regardless of whether the DefaultJobByEquipmentId &#160;option is set in the sys-viewer-vwrkordr registry. &#160;</p>
<p>The 'WARNING: this work order has open assignments to remote technicians' message is disabled when the Quote Master Approval Wizard is run so the post will not fail.</p>
<p>The text from the Scope of Services is no longer changed to all lower case in the Work Order's Work Requested when the Quote is approved and a new Work Order generated. &#160;</p>
<p>This release corrects sporadic 'Runtime error: key is missing' occurrences.</p>
<h3>12.5.1 Technicians Screen</h3>
<p>In previous releases, if the Approval Wizard was run for Sub lines without a Vendor, the technician lookup returned the first Tech record with no Vendor associated with it. In this release, validation has been added to require a Vendor Id on Subcontract lines when an option is approved. This also prevents the PO post from failing because a Vendor was not specified. &#160;</p>
<p>If the user elects to create a New Work Order, the ApprovalWizardDefaultTechStatus option is only used to set the Tech Status on lines for the NEW WO: the current Tech Statuses for the source WO will not be changed. If the user elects to write back to an existing Work Order, &#160;the ApprovalWizardDefaultTechStatus option provides the default Tech Status for all Tech lines listed on the Technicians screen.</p>
<p><font style="font-weight: bold;">New Field – WO</font> <font style="font-weight: bold;">Display:<br /></font>If the Quote is being written to a new Work Order, the designation ‘New’ will appear in the WO Id column. Lines for the original source Work Order will also appear, and may be updated by the user if needed.</p>
<p style="font-weight: bold;">Technician Lines appear in the Wizard according to the following rules:</p>
<p style="margin-left: 36.00pt;">1. When Export to Existing WO is selected, the existing tech lines from the source work order are shown, plus any new lines added for Subcontractor Techs generated from the Subcontractor tab; the WO Display field will display the source WO Id followed by a asterisk * for these new lines.</p>
<p style="margin-left: 36.00pt;">2. When Export to New WO is selected, a 'new' WO Tech line is included in the wizard and is posted to the new work order, along with any lines added for Subcontractor Techs generated from the Subcontractor tab. These lines are indicated as ‘New’ in the WO Display field.</p>
<p style="margin-left: 36.00pt;">The Wizard also displays lines from the original source work order: the Work Order Id will appear in the WO Display field. They may be edited by the user. In this release, edits to the Time Scheduled for existing lines will successfully update the source Work Order.</p>
<h3>12.5.2 Change to Effective Date of Quoted Labor Lines</h3>
<p>In this release, the effective date of labor lines written to the Work Order are determined as follows:</p>
<p style="margin-left: 48px;">If no Pay Period is flagged as default, use today's date.<br />
If today's date falls within the default Pay Period, use today's date.<br />
If today's date &lt; the default Pay Period's Start, Date use the Pay Period's Start Date.<br />
If today's date &gt; the default Pay Period's End Date, use the Pay Period's End Date.</p>
<p style="margin-left: 8px;">In previous releases, the Effective date was set to the last day of the default PR period; this might be an issue if the quote was itemized, and the end of the Pay Period is a couple of weeks in the future. If the quote was completed quickly, and the WO invoiced with an effective date of today, these labor charges would not appear on the invoice. This change puts the effective date as close as possible to today's date.</p>
<h3>12.5.3 Approval Wizard PO Processing</h3>
<p style="margin-left: 8px;">Corrects a recent problem posting Subcontractor lines to the Purchase Order.</p>
<p style="margin-left: 8px;">In the Purchase Order, the General Tab requires a unique Description field. Previously, the Approval &#160;Wizard did not properly consolidate lines if they use different/mixed cases (e.g. Parts SENSOR &amp; Parts sensor), resulting in a failure to generate the PO. The system now evaluates the Quote's Material Tab Descriptions as lower case for consolidation purposes, but uses the first Description when writing to the PO record.</p>
<h5>12.5.3a Approval Wizard Closed PO Validation</h5>
<p>The Quotemaster Approval Wizard now checks to see if the Date Closed is set on a Purchase Order it is set to update. &#160;The user is warned that "The following Purchase Orders are closed and cannot be updated". &#160;After clearing this message, the user has the option of proceeding or canceling the Wizard (so that the PO referenced in the Quote may be changed or cleared before rerunning the Wizard). Canceling the Wizard and correcting the problem is recommended.</p>
<p>If the user elected to continue and the post to the PO failed, the user will be warned, and a text file (ErrorLogForQuote_######_date_time) specifying the problem will be written to the directory named in the dbreportfiles registry.</p>
<h2>12.6 Handling of Option Codes with Uppercase Text</h2>
<p style="font-weight: bold;">Quote Viewer:</p>
<p>This release corrects a problem encountered if the Scope's Option Code included uppercase text, but the detail tabs referencing it Option Code used lowercase text. This could result in the non-Fixed Price totals displayed on Scope tab not correctly reflecting the detail amounts or the printed quote. In this release, text Option Codes are handled correctly in new quotes, regardless of whether they are entered in upper or lower case.</p>
<p style="font-weight: bold; font-style: italic;">For existing (but not fully approved) Quotes, click the Revenue Adjust button to synchronize the Scope Option revenues for non-Fixed Price quotes with the revenue amounts on the detail tabs.</p>
<p style="font-weight: bold;">Quote Master Wizard:</p>
<p>All Option Codes listed on the Wizard are now displayed in lower-case text.</p>
<p style="font-weight: bold;">Quote Master Option Code Selector:</p>
<p>When you double-click on the Option Code on one of the detail tabs (Labor, Inventory, etc.), all Option Codes will be displayed in lower-case text.</p>
<h3>12.7 Purchase Orders from Quotemaster</h3>
<p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">Previously, the system disallowed changing the Vendor on PO's generated from a Quote.&#160;This restriction has been relaxed so that the Vendor can be changed if no receipts have been performed on the PO and it is NOT a Subcontractor PO.&#160;&#160;</p>
<h1>13 Requisitioning</h1>
<p>The Security Id is now written to Inventory History for the following functions: Fill Backorders, Print Shop Transfer Tickets, Record Shop Transfer Tickets, Start Generate Purchase Orders, Start WO Tech Material Pickup.</p>
<h2>13.1 Registry</h2>
<h3>13.1.1 Registry to Set Initial Values of As Of and End Date Scheduled</h3>
<p style="margin-left: 8px;">An enhancement allows the user to will limit the processing to only work order with a WO Technician tab Date Scheduled within the date range specified.&#160;&#160;It is STRONGLY suggested that the following registry entry is enabled to provide reasonable initial values for this function:</p>
<p style="margin-left: 48px;">Note: if both the Start Date Scheduled and End Date Scheduled are set to the blank date (1900-01-01), ONLY those Work Orders with an Tech Line for the blank date will be selected.</p>
<p style="margin-left: 8px;"><span style="font-weight: bold;">Registry Id:</span> sys-start-smtrlrqstnng</p>
<p style="margin-left: 8px;"><span style="font-weight: bold;">Setting Key:</span> InitialValueFor~dte-as-of &#160;&#160;&#160;Setting Value: ^today^</p>
<p style="margin-left: 8px;"><span style="font-weight: bold;">Setting Key:</span> InitialValueFor~dte-schdld-end &#160;&#160;&#160;Setting Value: ^today^</p>
<h3>13.1.2 &#160;Registry to Import Required Resource Costs from JCH (Job Budget)</h3>
<p>When Inventory Items are entered on the Job's Budget tab, the Last overall cost, overall Average, or Standard cost is defaulted in, depending on whether the item's Cost Method is set to Last, Average or Standard. &#160;The budget's Cost field may be changed by the user.</p>
<p>By default, when Required Resources are imported to the Work Order Required Resource tab from the Job Budget / JCH history, the applicable Cost for the Work Order's Staging location (defined by the sys-viewer-vshpordr registry's MaterialReqFromLocation option) is used, overriding Costs entered manually or by default on the Job Budget tab. &#160;In this release, a registry option has been added to use the Cost entered on the Job Budget tab instead. Separate entries enable this feature to be implement for Inventory Items and Miscellaneous Materials separately.</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: bold;">Registry Id:</span> sys-ffv-global-settings</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: bold;">Setting Key:</span> DefaultRequiredResourceCostsFromJCHBudgetsINV &#160;<span style="font-weight: bold;">Setting Value:</span> true (default false)</p>
<p>When this option is set to true, the system will use the job history cost (from the Job Budget) when importing Inventory Item Work Order Required Resources from JCH. If the Job Budget tab includes multiple lines for the same item, the cost entered on the latest line for that item will be used in the import. If the Cost from JCH (on the Job Budget) is zero, the Last Cost from the Staging Location will be imported.</p>
<p>This option should be enabled if the Job Budget is manually adjusted, and it more desirable to import these costs (when available) than the most recent ones recorded for the work order's staging location.</p>
<p>This option is also considered when the Work Order's RR Wizard is run. If this option is set to true, &#160;the system uses the current Required Resource tab cost. If this registry is not set, the Vendor's last cost is used (previous default behavior).<br />
<br />
<span style="font-weight: bold;">Setting Key:</span> DefaultRequiredResourceCostsFromJCHBudgetsMISC &#160;&#160;&#160;<span style="font-weight: bold;">Setting Value:</span> true (default false)</p>
<p>When this option is set to true, the system will use the job history cost (from the Job Budget) when importing material (non-inventory) Work Order Required resources from JCH. &#160;If this option is not enabled if the Job Budget, the cost of imported non-inventory material will always be set to zero.</p>
<p>This option is also considered when the Work Order's RR Wizard is run. If this option is set to true, &#160;the system uses the current Required Resource tab cost. If this registry is not set, the cost is set to zero (previous default behavior). This setting is recommended even if the inventory option (see above) is not, as it allows the cost on the Required Resource tab to be written to the Purchase Order.</p>
<h5>Work Order Required Resource Tab:</h5>
<p><span style="font-weight: bold;">Changed Fields: Vendor Id &#160;/ Unit Cost</span><br />
If the Unit Cost is not zero, and you change the Vendor Id (which may change the Unit Cost), the system will prompt you to confirm the change to the cost. &#160;The user should answer 'No' if costs are routinely imported from the Job Budget.</p>
<h5>Import RR Wizard:</h5>
<p><span style="font-weight: bold;">Changed Field: Use Default Vendor</span><br />
If the registry entry DefaultRequiredResourceCostsFromJCHBudgetsINV (see Customer Release Note 16.7.8.d) is NOT set to true, and the Vendor box is flagged, the system will use the cost from the Inventory Vendor tab if available, the last cost if not.</p>
<p>If the registry entry DefaultRequiredResourceCostsFromJCHBudgetsINV is set to true, and the Vendor box is flagged, the system will use the cost from the Job Budget tab if set, and the last cost from the Stage Location if not.</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: bold;">New Field: Unit Cost Budget</span><br />
This field will be completed if the registry option(s) to set the import cost from job cost history (from the Job Budget) are enabled, AND the cost was set to a non-zero amount in the budget. If this field is not zero it will be used to set the Unit Cost of imported items. &#160;</p>
<h5>Work Order RR Wizard:</h5>
<p>When posting costs to a PO from with the Wizard, costs are determined as follow</p>
<p>If the global settings DefaultRequiredResourceCostsFromJCHBudgetsINV option is is set to true, &#160;the system uses the current Required Resource tab cost. If this registry is not set, the Vendor's last cost is used (previous default behavior).</p>
<p>If the global settings DefaultRequiredResourceCostsFromJCHBudgetsMISC option is set to true, &#160;the system uses the current Required Resource tab cost. If this registry is not set, the cost is set to zero (previous default behavior). This setting is recommended even if the inventory option (see above) is not, as it allows the cost on the Required Resource tab to be written to the Purchase Order.</p>
<h3>13.1.3 Registry To Flag Default Vendor on Work Order Import from JCH</h3>
<p>The Import RR button on the WO Required Resource Tab displays a prompt screen to enable the user to import Required Resources from either Job History or an external spreadsheet (.cvs file).</p>
<p>A new Option, Use Default Vendor, has been added to the prompter screen for both the Job History and Spreadsheet imports. This option would generally not be used if full-fledge requisitioning (Start Material Requisitioning) is enabled. &#160;&#160;</p>
<p>The following registry is now used as the default setting for this field:</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: bold;">Registry Id:</span> sys-ffv-global-settings</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: bold;">Setting Key:</span> DefaultRequiredResourceVendorFromJCHBudgets &#160;<span style="font-weight: bold;">Setting Value: true</span> &#160;&#160;(default false)</p>
<p style="font-weight: bold; margin-left: 48px;">Important Note:<br />
<span style="font-weight: normal;">If the following registry setting is absent or set to false, the Inventory Item's Vendor will NOT default on manually entered Required Resource lines. &#160;Regardless of this setting for manual entry, the new Use Default Vendor flag rules on how the Vendor is or is not set on imports.<br />
<br />
Registry Id: sys-ffv-global-settings<br />
Setting Key: DefaultRequiredResourceVendorFromInventory &#160;&#160;Setting Value: true (default false)</span></p>
<h5>Prompter Screen for Import from Job History:</h5>
<p style="font-weight: bold; margin-left: 48px;">New Option: Use Default Vendor?</p>
<p style="margin-left: 48px;">This field is initially set via registry, but may be changed by the user.</p>
<p style="margin-left: 48px;">If Use Default Vendor? is flagged, the system will use the default Vendor from the Inventory Item record's Purchasing tab (if specified) during the import.</p>
<p style="margin-left: 48px;">If Use Default Vendor? is blank no Vendor will be defaulted during the import.</p>
<h5>Prompter Screen for Import from a Spreadsheet</h5>
<p style="font-weight: bold; margin-left: 48px;">New Option: Use Default Vendor?</p>
<p style="margin-left: 48px;">This field is initially set via registry, but may be changed by the user.</p>
<p style="margin-left: 48px;">If Use Default Vendor? is flagged and the Vendor is specified in the spreadsheet, the system will use the spreadsheet's Vendor during the import.</p>
<p style="margin-left: 48px;">If Use Default Vendor? is flagged, and a Vendor is NOT specified in the spreadsheet, the system will use the default Vendor from the Inventory Item record's Purchasing tab during the import.</p>
<p style="margin-left: 48px;">If Use Default Vendor? is blank, the system will always use the Vendor from the spreadsheet during the import, even if it is blank.</p>
<h2>13.2 Reports</h2>
<h2>13.3 Material Requisitioning – Branch Level Processing and Other Enhancements</h2>
<p>This release supports Requisitioning at the Branch level. The following enhancements have been implemented so that ‘From’ and ‘Staging’ locations may be specified for each Branch.</p>
<h3>13.3.1 Shop Order Registry</h3>
<p>Branch settings now override the non-branch standard settings (branch derived from WO/Job):</p>
<p><font style="font-weight: bold;">Id:</font> sys-viewer-vshpordr-<font style="font-style: italic;">branchid</font></p>
<h5>Registry Option for Non Stocked Items</h5>
<p style="margin-left: 36.00pt;">This release supports a new registry option for a default location for non-stocked inventory items in the sys-viewer-vshpordr / sys-viewer-vshpordr-<font style="font-style: italic;">branchid</font></p>
<p style="margin-left: 36.00pt;"><font style="font-weight: bold;">Setting Key:</font> MaterialRequisitionFromLocationNonStocked</p>
<p style="margin-left: 36.00pt;"><font style="font-weight: bold;">Setting Value:</font> <font style="font-style: italic;">LocationIdforNonStocked</font></p>
<h5><font style="font-weight: bold;">Registry to Use</font> <font style="font-weight: bold;">WO RR Location</font> <font style="font-weight: bold;">(deprecated)</font></h5>
<p style="margin-left: 36.00pt;">This registry option is <font style="font-weight: bold;">not</font> recommended. When shop orders are generated for Materials Requisitioning, the user-specified location (in the Work Order Required Resource Tab) will only override the default location ‘From’ registry settings for the From location if this registry is in effect:</p>
<p style="margin-left: 36.00pt;">&#160;Setting Key: UseWORequiredResourceLocation Setting Value: true</p>
<h3>13.3.2 Start Material Requisitioning</h3>
<p style="font-weight: bold; margin-left: 8px;">New Fields: Start Date Scheduled &#160;&#160;- &#160;End Date Schedule<br />
<span style="font-weight: normal;">This enhancement allows the user to will limit the processing to only work order with a WO Technician tab Date Scheduled within the date range specified.</span>&#160;&#160;</p>
<p style="margin-left: 48px;"><span style="font-weight: bold;">Note:</span> if both the Start Date Scheduled and End Date Scheduled are set to the blank date (1900-01-01), ONLY those Work Orders with an Tech Line for the blank date will be selected. It is STRONGLY suggested that the registry entry detailed in Customer Note 13.1.1 is enabled to provide reasonable initial values for this function:</p>
<p style="font-weight: bold;">New Range: Branch Id:<br />
<span style="font-weight: normal;">This new range implements Branch filtering for this function.</span></p>
<p>If hard-block Branch filtering is enabled (with the sys-ffv-global-settings option BranchFilterWithHardBlock set to true), the Branch Id will automatically be set to the user’s Branch filter: even if the user clears the Branch Id range, only those Branches that match his or her Branch filter (in the User record) will appear.</p>
<h3>13.3.3 Start Create PM Work Order</h3>
<p>This release corrects a sporadic problem where the Tech on the previously created Work Order was written to the Service Evaluations tab on the next Work Order if it was unassigned. &#160;</p>
<p>Revenue Adjustment lines (used for accrual / revenue recognition) for Time-of-Service Earned PM's now have their Tax Type Id is set to 'na' instead of ' na' so that no tax is computed.</p>
<p>When this function is run, the Location field of Requisition lines will remain blank; it is no longer set from the default technician’s location.</p>
<h3>13.3.4 Start Release Work Orders</h3>
<p>The Branch Id range may now be changed by the user to allow filtering Work Orders by their Branch. This function now ignores Work Orders matching the selected status but with empty Required Resource lines.</p>
<h2>13.4 Required Resource Purchase Orders</h2>
<p>In previous releases, the Vendor could not be changed on unreceived PO's generated from the WO Required Resource lines via the Required Resource Wizard. In this release, The Vendor ID can be changed on an unreceived PO. Doing so also updates the Work Order's Required Resource lines) with the new Vendor's Id. Refresh/reopen the Work Order to see this change.</p>
<h3>13.4.1 WO Required Resource PO Wizard</h3>
<p>PO's created from the Required Resources tab of the Work Order have their Date Requested/Promised fields set as follows:</p>
<p style="margin-left: 48px;">The Date Requested/Promised on the PO details lines will be set from the Work Order Required Resource tab's Date Required.</p>
<p style="margin-left: 48px;">The Date Requested/Promised in the header of the PO will be set to the lowest date of detail lines. &#160;For example, if Required Resource lines are have dates required of June 1, 2014, June 5, 2014 and June 6, 2014, the PO header Date Required/Promised will be set to June 1, 2014.</p>
<h3>13.4.2 GL Account Written to PO Miscellaneous Lines (Change to Default Behavior)</h3>
<p>In previous releases, when miscellaneous (non-inventory) items entered on the Required Resource Tab of the work order where processed through the WO's RR Wizard button, the Misc. Inventory Group's Asset account was assigned on the Purchase Order; since there items were destined for the work order and not stock, selecting an Asset account was NOT appropriate.</p>
<p>In this release, the following hierarchy is used to derive the GL Account on Purchase Order General lines:</p>
<p style="margin-left: 48px;">If the Cost Category has an Expense Account use it (whether or not an Other Rate is specified).</p>
<p style="margin-left: 48px;">If the Cost Category does not include a GL Expense and Other Rate is specified, the Expense Account defaults from the Other Rate's Debit Account.</p>
<p style="margin-left: 48px;">If the Cost Category does not included a GL Expense Account, and the Other Rate is blank, use the Vendor's Default Expense Account (if set).</p>
<p style="margin-left: 48px;">If none of the above specifies the GL Account, the GL Expense Account (if completed) from the MISC Inventory Group is used. &#160;If this is blank, the Asset Account from the MISC is used.</p>
<h2>13.5 &#160;Start Material Requisitioning</h2>
<p>Credit Hold Work Orders are now blocked from the checklist. &#160;The user is informed of the problem, in a workspace text box, followed by the list of excluded Credit Hold Work Orders:</p>
<p style="margin-left: 48px;">"The following WorkOrders on Credit Hold were not processed. A Credit Manager must remove the WorkOrder from Credit Hold before rerunning this function. &#160;A WorkOrder appearing on this list multiple times has multiple items to be requisitioned."</p>
<h2>13.6 Work Order</h2>
<p><span style="font-weight: bold;">Import Costs:</span><br />
Imported Material and Other lines now retain their Job information even when the DefaultJobByEquipmentId setting is enabled via registry.</p>
<p>This release corrects a sporadic problem where the Requisitioned? field on the Work Order Requisition tab was set to Yes on new lines.</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: bold;">Work Order Type: Requisition</span><br />
A new option ('Requisition') has been added to the Work Order Type field. &#160;The Work Order Type "Requisition" should be used ONLY for the purpose of requisitioning materials for installation/construction jobs and should not be used for service or PM work orders. When the Work Order Type is set to Requisition, running the Start Tech (Work Order) Material Pickup creates the IM Adjustments transaction as a Loc-to-Job transfer instead of transferring the materials to a location (typically, the Tech's truck).</p>
<p>The user will be warned when this Work Order Type is selected.</p>
<h2>13.7 Start Tech Material Pickup (Start Work Order Material Pickup)</h2>
<p style="font-weight: normal;">This release corrects a Runtime error that occurred if this function was run a second time to complete the transfer of additional back-ordered items. &#160;</p>
<p style="font-weight: normal;">Validation ensures that this function can be run only once for the same material.</p>
<p style="font-weight: bold;"><span style="font-weight: normal;">This function now defaults the overall item last cost if the location-specific cost is zero. &#160;This corrects an issue encountered when the cost at the Staging location was zero for a particular item.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: bold;">New Field: Work Order Type</span><br />
This display-only field shows the Work Order Type of the selected Work Order.</p>
<p style="margin-left: 48px;">If the Work Order Type NOT set to Requisition, running this function will transfer the inventory to the selected Transfer To location (typically, the Technician's truck).</p>
<p style="margin-left: 48px;">If the Work Order Type is set to Requisition, running this function transfers the inventory directly to the &#160;Work Order/Job. &#160;The Work Order Type "Requisition" should be used only for the purpose of requisitioning materials for installation/construction jobs and should NOT be used for service or preventive maintenance work orders.</p>
<p style="margin-left: 8px;">This function now supports Branch Processing.</p>
<p style="margin-left: 8px;"><span style="font-weight: bold;">Changed Field: &#160;Transfer From:</span><br />
This display-only field specifies the Staging Location inventory is being pulled from. It defaults from the MaterialRequisitionToLocation=staginglocation option of the sys-viewer-vshpordr (or sys-viewer-vshpordr-BranchId if branches are enabled) registry entry.</p>
<p style="margin-left: 8px;"><span style="font-weight: bold;">New Field: Technician Id</span><br />
This field provides a new way of specifying the 'To' Location; when the Technician is selected, the Transfer To: location is set to the Tech's truck location.</p>
<p style="margin-left: 8px;"><span style="font-weight: bold;">Changed Field: Location Id:</span><br />
When the Work Order is first entered, this display-only field defaults from the Work Order header. If the Technician Id is changed, it displays the Tech's truck location.</p>
<p style="margin-left: 8px;"><span style="font-weight: bold;">Change Field: Transfer To:</span><br />
If the Work Order is assigned to a Technician, this field defaults from the Tech's truck location. The user may change the Location (if needed) directly or by changing the Technician Id. When the user clicks Go, the transfer will be made to the Location specified in this field.</p>
<h1>14 Shop Orders</h1>
<p>See user note 13.3.1 for Shop Order changes related to Material Requisitioning.</p>
<h3><span style="font-weight: bold;">14.1. Shop Order Record Transfer Ticket</span></h3>
<p>The Unit Cost from the stocking location is now written to the staging location by this function. This cost will be used by the Tech Material Transfer function, resulting in a more accurate cost when applied to the Work Order.</p>
<p>Empty reversing lines for GL History are no longer generated when a Shop Order Record Pick List entry generated for requisitioning is edited; these entries do not generate GL History in the first place.</p>
<p>The Work Order Id and Name have been added to the parent screen. An error message now appears if the record fails to load properly: after acknowledging the prompt, the viewer is cleared and the Shop Order Id must be re-selected.</p>
<h1>15 Client Order Processing</h1>
<h2>15.1 Registry</h2>
<h3>15.1.1 Receive Drop Shipped Items on IRJ</h3>
<p>This enhancement allows the Inventory Receipts Journal to ‘receive’ drop shipped Client Orders. This will allow the Client Order to be invoiced earlier in the workflow cycle.</p>
<p>When implemented via registry, the Inventory Receipts Journal will create the appropriate clntordrtoshp records for Invoicing. When the Vendor’s invoice is eventually vouchered, the AP Journal will skip making the clntordrtoshp records if it determines that they have already been created by the IRJ.</p>
<p>The following sys-ffv-global-settings registry option will be used to determine whether the IRJ or the APJ will be used to create the necessary clntordrtoshp records: COPDropShipReceiptsVia. If the corresponding value is ‘IRJ’, the Inventory Receipts Journal will create the clntordrtoshp records. Any other value (or a missing key) will retain the current behavior where the APJ will create the clntordrtoshp records.</p>
<p>The existing COPDropShipReceipts key must be also be set to manual, as shown below.</p>
<p><font style="font-weight: bold;">Id:</font> sys-ffv-global-settings</p>
<p><font style="font-weight: bold;">Setting Key:</font> COPDropShipReceiptsVia <font style="font-weight: bold;">Setting Value:</font> IRJ (default is APJ)</p>
<p><font style="font-weight: bold;">Setting Key:</font> COPDropShipReceipts&#160;<font style="font-weight: bold;">Setting Value:</font> manual</p>
<p class="Support" style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">&#160;</p>
<h3>15.1.2 Include COP Transfers in Last Cost Calculations</h3>
<p>If this feature is enabled, inventory history entries with a source journal of 'Order Transfer' will be included in the queries determining last cost. A registry entry is required to enable this feature.</p>
<p><font style="font-weight: bold;">Registry Id:</font> sys-inventory-costing</p>
<p><font style="font-weight: bold;">Setting Key:</font> IncludeCOPTransfersInLastCost'</p>
<p><font style="font-weight: bold;">Setting Value:</font> Y or T</p>
<p>This feature defaults to disabled; COP Transfers will be used in inventory cost calculations, but not to set the last cost.</p>
<h3>15.1.3 Create Equipment for Serialized Items</h3>
<p>The Record Pick Ticket function will not allow the Make Equipment flag to be checked unless:<br />
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;- The feature is turned on in the SAMPro 'user-COP' registry entry.<br />
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;- The item is either a Serialize On Sale item or a Serialized item.</p>
<p>If the item is a Serialized Item, the COP Invoice Post will now create a new Client Site Equipment record for the item. To turn this feature on the following registry must be enabled:</p>
<p><font style="font-weight: bold;">Id:</font> user-COP</p>
<p><font style="font-weight: bold;">Setting Key:</font> AutoGenerateEquipment <font style="font-weight: bold;">Setting Value:</font> Y</p>
<h3>15.1.4 Registry to Define Branch Defaulting</h3>
<p>This enhancement provides a way to mark which Branch a COP order is associated to: the Site or the Location. The Branch has been added to the Location viewer to enable this since one Site might have orders filled from different warehouses at different branches. In addition, the Branch Id has been added to the COP Main tab. The following registry specifies where the default Branch comes from (Site or Location) when a Client Order is created.</p>
<p><font style="font-weight: bold;">Id:</font> sys-viewer-vclntordr</p>
<p><font style="font-weight: bold;">Setting Key:</font> BranchDefault <font style="font-weight: bold;">Setting Value:</font> location or site</p>
<p class="Support" style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">&#160;</p>
<h3>15.1.5 Purchase Orders for Drop-Shipped COP Orders</h3>
<p>In this release, the sys-viewer-vprchseordrlst option for the customized Ship To address setting (sqlShipToWorkSite) also supports Purchase Orders generated as Client Order Drop-Ships. This allows the Client Site Name to be included in the Shipping Address.</p>
<p style="margin-left: 36.00pt; text-decoration: underline;">Example:</p>
<p style="margin-left: 36.00pt;"><font style="font-weight: bold;">Id:</font> sys-viewer-vprchseordlst</p>
<p style="margin-left: 36.00pt;"><font style="font-weight: bold;">Setting Key:</font> sqlshipToWorkSite</p>
<p style="margin-left: 36.00pt;"><font style="font-weight: bold;">Setting Value:</font> clntste_nme, 'RE: Order# ', clntste_addrss_shp_addrss_strt, clntste_addrss_shp_addrss_strt_2, clntste_addrss_shp_addrss_cty, clntste_addrss_shp_addrss_stte, clntste_addrss_shp_addrss_zp</p>
<p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">&#160;</p>
<p>If enabled, the sys-viewer-vprchseordrlst entry’s AutoFillReceived=true option is ignored so that COP PO’s are never auto-received.</p>
<h3>15.1.6 COP Credit Manager – User Registry Tab</h3>
<p>If the Credit Manager? Boolean is checked in the User record, the User is considered a Credit Manager for ALL order types. In this release, the User Registry tab settings allows COP or Work Order Credit Manager rights to be specified as follows:</p>
<p>If the Credit Manager flag is unchecked but the User Registry Tab has the following setting, then the user is allowed to approve credit on COP orders.</p>
<p style="margin-left: 36.00pt;"><font style="font-weight: bold;">Key:</font> CreditManagerCOP <font style="font-weight: bold;">Value:</font> true</p>
<p style="margin-left: 36.00pt;"><font style="font-weight: bold;">Note:</font> For Client Orders, the user should enter all lines BEFORE flagging the Credit Approved box on the AR tab since the COP Credit Approval is for the specific amount entered on the order.</p>
<p>If the Credit Manager flag is unchecked but the User Registry Tab record has the following setting, then the user is allowed to approve credit on work orders</p>
<p style="margin-left: 36.00pt;"><font style="font-weight: bold;">Setting Key:</font> CreditManagerWO <font style="font-weight: bold;">Value:</font> true</p>
<h3>15.1.7 Set Allow Partial Bill Field to Unchecked</h3>
<p>The following registry entry sets the default value for ‘Allow Partial Bill’ to be set to unchecked (blank). This registry entry should be enabled if company policy is to Bill Complete Client Orders. Lines that can be completed as part of the accelerated Print Invoice button processing are also counted as completed. Drop-shipped orders must be fully received (via IRJ) to be considered Complete.</p>
<p style="margin-left: 36.00pt;"><span style="font-weight: bold;">Registry Id:</span> sys-viewer-vclntordr</p>
<p style="margin-left: 36.00pt;"><span style="font-weight: bold;">Setting Key:</span> AllowPartialBillDefault Setting Value: N</p>
<h3>15.1.8 Require PO Unit Cost in COP Dropship Wizard</h3>
<p>The following registry may be used to make the Unit Cost a required field in the COP Dropship wizard: this is highly recommended.</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: bold;">Registry Id:</span> sys-wizard-copdropshipwizard</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: bold;">Setting Key:</span> requiredfieldspolines <span style="font-weight: bold;">Setting Value</span>: prchseordrlst.unt-cst</p>
<h3><span id="BugEvents81">15.1.9 Default GL Entity from Location Instead of Site COP Tab</span></h3>
<p><span>By default, the GL Entity in the Client Order defaults from the Client Site COP tab, &#160;The following registry enables the GL Entity to default from the Location instead.</span></p>
<p><span id="BugEvents151" style="font-weight: bold;">Registry Id:</span> <span>sys-viewer-vclntordr</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: bold;">Setting Key:</span> <span>EntityDefault &#160;&#160;&#160;</span><span style="font-weight: bold;">Setting Value:</span> <span>location</span></p>
<h3>15.1.10 Display Sales Tax Authorities on COP Portrait Invoice (Canadian Sales Tax)</h3>
<p>When this option is enabled, up to 2 Sales Tax Authorities (derived from the Sales Tab Group) will be displayed on the COP Invoice. In addition, the name of the sales tax authority will print instead of simply 'SALES TAX'. This is currently implemented for the Portrait mode only.</p>
<p>The following registry entry is required to enable this functionality.</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: bold;">Registry Id:</span> sys-report-rcopinvce &#160;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: bold;">Setting Key:</span> MultipleSalesTaxLines &#160;&#160;&#160;<span style="font-weight: bold;">Setting Value:</span> Yes</p>
<h3>15.1.11 &#160;COP Portrait Invoices Only</h3>
<p>A recent internal change caused the portrait orientation option of the COP Invoice to be ignored in sys-printer-rcopinvce unless a default printer is specified.&#160;&#160;Add this option &#160;to the following registry to correct.</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: bold;">Registry Id:</span> sys-printer-<span style="font-weight: bold;">dialog</span>-rcopinvce</p>

<h3>15.2.1 COP Invoice</h3>
<p><b>C</b>alculation of Freight Tax on COP invoices is now based on the Client Order's Sales Tax Group, not the Client Site COP tab Sales Group.</p>
<p>When the user prints COP Invoices but does not indicate that the print was OK, the invoice number is now correctly committed and will be available when printed and confirmed.</p>
<p><font style="font-weight: bold;">COP Invoice</font> <font style="font-weight: bold;">New Field:</font></p>
<p style="margin-left: 36.00pt;"><font style="font-weight: bold;">Ordered By:<br /></font>This field defaults from the corresponding Client Order field. It is printed below the Sold To address on the invoice.</p>
<p style="font-weight: bold;">Inventory Receipts Journal: New Field</p>
<p style="margin-left: 36.00pt;"><font style="font-weight: bold;">Billable Freight:<br /></font> COP Invoicing has been enhanced to obtain the freight charge from this field, if completed. It will appear on the COP Invoice.</p>

<p style="margin-left: 36.00pt;">In previous releases, if a user added freight on the General tab of the AP Journal for a PO referenced on a COP drop ship order, the COST of that freight was picked up and invoiced on the subsequent COP invoice. With this enhancement, the system will also look at the REVENUE value entered in the AP GEN tab line, and if not zero, use it for the COP invoice. If the Revenue is zero, the system will continue to use Cost value.</p>
<p><font style="font-weight: bold;">Invoicing /</font> <font style="font-weight: bold;">Date Shipped</font></p>
<p style="margin-left: 36.00pt;">When Drop Ship POs are received from either the Inventory Receipts Journal (IRJ) or the AP Journal (APJ), the Date Shipped is set as follows:<br />
<br />
&#160;&#160;IRJ: Take the Date Shipped from the Date Received Field.<br />
&#160;&#160;APJ: Take the Date Shipped from the Effective Date Field.<br />
<br />
The End Date in Report COP Invoice looks at the Shipping Date; Shipping Dates past the End Date will not be included on the invoice.</p>
<p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">&#160;</p>
<h3>15.2.2 COP Picket Ticket</h3>
<p>This release corrects the column title formatting.</p>
<p>The Client Order’s ‘Entered by’ field (the User Id of the individual who created the Client Order) now appears to the right of the Location (Warehouse) field on the Pick Ticket.</p>
<h2>15.3 Client Order</h2>
<p>This release corrects an auto-loading problem so that the Account Manager saved in the Client Order is correctly displayed when it is re-opened.</p>
<p>The Print Invoice button simulates the Pick Ticket Print and Receipt if available stock is on hand. Serialized items are now excluded from this functionality so that they must go through the actual Print / Record Pick Ticket process so that the Serial Number is recorded.</p>
<p>This release corrects a problem in the Print Invoice button's Pick Ticket emulation that allowed a non-drop-shipped item to be re-invoiced.&#160;</p>
<h3>15.3.1 Client Order Items Tab</h3>
<p><span id="BugEvents331">In this release, the user can delete a line referencing a cancelled line from a Change Order PO. Previously, this functionality was only available if the PO retained its original base number. &#160;</span></p>
<p style="font-weight: bold;">New Fields</p>
<p style="margin-left: 36.00pt;"><font style="font-weight: bold;">Unit Cost:<br /></font>This field defaults from the Inventory Item record when a new line is entered. It appears on the line and detail views for the Items child tab. If the Item's Cost specified as Average, the Unit Cost is set based on the Inventory Location (if available) specified on the Order first, then the overall cost.</p>
<p style="margin-left: 72.00pt;"><font style="font-weight: bold;">Note:</font> Client Orders created prior to 8.2 display a Unit Cost of 0.00. Orders created news versions display the cost that was defaulted when the line was entered.</p>
<p style="margin-left: 36.00pt;"><font style="font-weight: bold;">Cost: Revenue: GM$: GM%:</font> <font style="font-weight: bold;">Markup%:<br /></font>A Cost, Revenue, Gross Margin $, Gross Margin % and Markup % summary for the order is now displayed at the top of the Items tab. This information is dynamically updated as the order is being entered.</p>
<p><font style="font-weight: bold;">Changed Field: Discount<br /></font>This field defaults from the Client Site COP tab’s Discount field if Special Pricing is NOT in effect. If Special Pricing is NOT in effect, the Price itself will be set from the Site’s Last Time Bought (if applicable), or the item’s regular Unit Price. If 'Special Pricing' is in effect, the Discount Percent field will default to zero.</p>
<p>Special Pricing is in effect if and only if both the following are true:</p>
<p style="margin-left: 36.00pt;">The Client Site’s Price Code Id (on the Client Site's Contacts tab) is completed.</p>
<p style="margin-left: 36.00pt;">A Pricing Exception for that Price Code exists on the Inventory Item's Pricing tab.</p>
<p><font style="font-weight: bold;">Changed Field: Inventory Id:<br /></font>The system now checks to see if a part has been superceded (the Superceded By field on the Inventory Other Tab is filled in). When a superseded part number is entered into this field, the system will alert the user that</p>
<p style="margin-left: 36.00pt;">Item A has been superceded by Item B. Use New Item?</p>
<p>It the user clicks Yes, the new part (B) will be returned to the field. If the user clicks No, part A (which has been superceded) will remain in the field.</p>
<p><font style="font-weight: bold;">Changed Field: Dropship Box</font><br />
Previously, the Dropship box had to be set before entering the Inventory Id. In this release:</p>
<p style="margin-left: 36.00pt;">- If No PO has been generated for the line - Allow Drop Ship Check box to be checked or unchecked after the Item Id has been entered.<br />
<br />
- If a PO has already been generated for the line - DO not allow the check box to be cleared unless the PO has been cancelled.</p>
<p style="margin-left: 36.00pt;">- Validation prevents the setting of the Drop Ship flag if the line is on a pick ticket or has been invoiced.</p>
<h3>15.3.2 Main Tab</h3>
<p style="font-weight: bold;">New Buttons:</p>
<p style="margin-left: 36.00pt;"><img src="image/PrintAck.gif" alt="image\PrintAck.gif" title="image\PrintAck.gif" width="125" height="28" border="0" /> Launches the Order Acknowledgement report if the Order Type is set to Order, Sample or Hold.</p>
<p style="margin-left: 36.00pt;"><img src="image/PrintQuote_quote.gif" alt="image\PrintQuote_quote.gif" title="image\PrintQuote_quote.gif" width="88" height="28" border="0" /> Launches the COP Quotation report for this Entry if the Order Type is set to Quote.</p>
<p><font style="font-weight: bold;">New Field: Allow Partial Bill?<br /></font>This new field allows the user to control when a client order is eligible for billing. If this field is flagged, the Client Order may be invoiced as its lines are completed; this preserves existing behavior.</p>
<p>To only bill an order when it is complete, this field should be cleared. Lines that can be completed as part of the accelerated Print Invoice button processing are also counted as completed. Drop-shipped orders must be fully received (via IRJ) to be considered Complete.</p>
<p>If Partial Billing is not allowed, the following message will be displayed if the order is not complete when the Print Invoice button is clicked:</p>
<p style="margin-left: 36.00pt;">Partial Billing is Not Allowed On This Order</p>
<p style="margin-left: 36.00pt;">To Invoice This Order, All Lines Must Be Eligible for Billing</p>
<p>See Customer Release Note 15.1.7 for a registry entry to set the default value of this field to unchecked (blank).</p>
<p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">&#160;</p>
<p><font style="font-weight: bold;">New Field: Branch Id<br /></font>The Branch Id will default from the Client Site or the Location (as defined by the sys-viewer-vclntordr BranchDefault registry option) but may be changed by the user.</p>
<p><font style="font-weight: bold;">Changed Field: Date Closed<br /></font>This field is now enabled for input to allow the user to close Quote and Hold type Client Orders. The validation for this field will not allow a date to be entered if it would be invalid to close the order (i.e. if the order includes any open allocations or back orders) for Order, Sample, and Transfer type orders.</p>
<p><font style="font-weight: bold;">Changed Field: Date Cancelled<br /></font>Previously, a Client Order could not be cancelled if it had one or more printed Pick Tickets. In this release, the validation has been changed so that a printed pick ticket does not prevent a Client Order from being cancelled. Client Orders may now be cancelled unless one of the following is true:</p>
<p style="margin-left: 36.00pt;">The order has one or more Unbilled lines which are marked Pick Done and which have a non-zero Quantity Shipped.</p>
<p style="margin-left: 36.00pt;">The order has one or more Drop Ship lines pointing to 'live' (not 'cancelled') PO lines.</p>
<p><font style="font-weight: bold;">New Buttons</font> <font style="font-weight: bold;">for Accelerated Processing:</font></p>
<p><img src="image/printpickticket.gif" alt="image\printpickticket.gif" title="image\printpickticket.gif" width="94" height="28" border="0" /><br />
This new button launches the Report Pick Ticket function for this Client Order.</p>
<p><img src="image/RecordPickTicket.gif" alt="image\RecordPickTicket.gif" title="image\RecordPickTicket.gif" width="94" height="28" border="0" /><br />
This new button launches the Record Pick with the Client Order Id completed.</p>
<p><img src="image/PrintInvoice.gif" alt="image\PrintInvoice.gif" title="image\PrintInvoice.gif" width="94" height="28" border="0" /><br />
This button allows the user to enter an order for available inventory and immediately fill and invoice it. This button simulates the&#160;printing and filling of the Pick Ticket for the currently displayed order (if this has not already been done), and then invokes the Report COP Invoice function properly defaulting the required settings and filter fields to allow the Invoice to be printed and posted.</p>
<p>The Print Invoice button on the Client Order supports Branch processing. It will also print the Invoice for an order that has had its Pick Ticket printed and recorded.</p>
<h3>15.3.5 Pick Ticket Tab</h3>
<p><font style="font-weight: bold;">New Field: Tracking Number<br /></font>&#160;The Tracking Number from the Packing Slip/Record Pick List Entry now appears on this tab.</p>
<h3>15.3.6 Client Order Drop Ship Wizard</h3>
<p>The COP Drop Ship Wizard has been enhanced so that the unit cost defaults according to the same rules that apply when generating a manual purchase order. The unit cost defaults from the Inventory Item’s Vendor tab (if available) or from the Item’s Last Cost otherwise. See Customer Note 15.1.8 for a registry entry to make the Unit Cost a required field in the wizard (highly recommended).</p>
<p>The Date Entered and Time Entered fields on the PO’s Status tab are now completed when the PO is generated as a Dropship.</p>
<p>The "Save" button no longer invokes the Drop Ship Wizard if the order is Cancelled.</p>
<p>This release corrects a problem where the Client Order Viewer's 'Drop Ship Wizard' erred out when used after switching Security Ids.</p>
<h3>15.3.7 Client Order List View</h3>
<p>A new sort order, ClientOrderByBranchIdByOrderId has been added.</p>
<p>This release corrects the list filtering so that if the Canceled or the Closed date is set, a Order will appear on the Closed list. Previously, both fields had to be set.</p>
<h3>15.3.8 Client Order Range View</h3>
<p>The Branch Id has been added as a Range filter.</p>
<h3>15.3.9 Client Order Addresses Tab</h3>
<p><font style="font-weight: bold;">New Field: Client Mailing Address<br /></font>This display-only field lists the bill-to address of the client.</p>
<h3>15.3.10 New Client Order Tab: Drop Shipments</h3>
<p>This tab lists all Drop Shipment Purchase Orders generated from this Client Order. You may double-click on a line to access the Purchase Order itself.</p>
<p>The following PO fields are displayed on the tab. &#160;Note that the PO will appear as received even if it has been only partially received.</p>
<p style="font-weight: bold;">PO Number – Vendor Id/Name – PO Date – Status – Received – Vouchered</p>
<p style="margin-left: 36.00pt;"><font style="font-weight: bold;">Tip:</font> If you cancel a PO line (so it is set to cancelled or pending cancel), you can then delete the corresponding line from the Client Order.</p>
<p style="margin-left: 36.00pt;"><span style="font-weight: bold;">Note: Change Orders</span><br />
If a Drop Shipped PO is edited and turned into a Change Order, it's Id is appended with a tack (-01) number: the tack number is not displayed on this tab. However, if you double-click on a PO line on the Drop Shipments tab, the system brings up <span id="BugEvents381">latest version of the PO/Changed Order.</span></p>
<h3>15.3.11 New Client Order Tab: Freight Charges</h3>
<p>This tab displays all Freight Charges associated with this Client Order. The following fields are displayed:</p>
<p style="font-weight: bold;">Category – Journal Id – Freight Amount</p>
<p>The Category specifies whether the charge was entered via the AP Journal (APJ) or Inventory Receipts Journal (IRJ) for Drop Shipments, or the Record Pick Tickets function (Pick Ticket).</p>
<p>The Total Freight charges are displayed in the tab's heading area.</p>
<p>This Tab is now sensitive to Inventory Receipt Journal edits (-01 and up transactions).</p>
<h3>15.3.12 New Client Order Tab: Invoices</h3>
<p>The new Invoices tab displays a table with the following display-only fields:</p>
<p><font style="font-weight: bold;">Invoice No – Invoice Date – Due Date – Charges –</font> <font style="font-weight: bold;">Credits – Entry Type</font></p>
<p>A summary of the Total Charges, Total Payments, and New Due appears at the top of the tab.</p>
<p>If completed, the Credits column displays payments (if the Entry Type Column is set to Sales) as well as Credit Memos (if the Entry Type is set to Credit Memo).</p>
<h3>15.3.13 Cancelling an Order</h3>
<p>When canceling an order or deleting a line, the code checks to see if the order has any drop ship lines attached to 'live' PO lines. Previously, a live PO line had any status other than 'Cancelled'. In this release, the system also considers the 'Pending Cancel' status to be non-live. In addition, validation considers any PO line to be non-live if the corresponding PO has a status of 'Cancelled' or 'Pending Cancel'.</p>
<h3>15.3.14 Client Order Last Time Sold Tab</h3>
<p>The Last Time Sold tab on the Client Order allows the user to double-click on an item to add it to the selected Item line. In this release, the user will be alerted if the line has been drop-shipped or picked, and will not be allowed to change the Inventory Item Id.</p>
<h2>15.4 Record COP Pick Ticket</h2>
<p style="font-weight: bold;">Warning if Freight was not Recorded</p>
<p>When a Client Order Pick Ticket is recorded, the following message will be displayed if Freight has not been added to at least one of the items being recorded:</p>
<p style="margin-left: 36.00pt;">Warning: This Pick Ticket Does Not Include Any Freight<br />
Do You Want to Save It Anyway?</p>
<p>Click Yes to save the entry without adding Freight, or No to return and add the Freight charges).</p>
<p><font style="font-weight: bold;">Changed Field: Serial Number:<br /></font>When you double-click on the 'Serial Number:' field in Record Pick Tickets, the list of serial numbers is now filtered to only show those for the specified Inventory Item. The system validates that there is a quantity on hand for that serial number when the record is saved.</p>
<p><font style="font-weight: bold;">Changed Field: Pick Ticket#:<br /></font>The user may now double-click in the Pick Ticket # field to display a list of valid Pick Ticket numbers (both recorded and not yet recorded) for this order. The system validates a value typed by the user against the list and prompts you if the number does not yet exist.</p>
<p><font style="font-weight: bold;">New Field -</font> <font style="font-weight: bold;">Tracking Number:<br /></font>Enter the tracking number provided by your shipper. This number will be printed on the COP Invoice.</p>
<h2>15.5 Client Site COP Tab</h2>
<p><font style="font-weight: bold;">New Field: Discount Percent<br /></font>This field expedites the automatic filling of the Percent Discount amount on Client Orders. It is used to set the Discount Percent on a Client Order line when the Inventory Item Id is entered if Special Pricing is NOT in effect. If Special Pricing is NOT in effect, the Price itself will continue to be set from the Site’s Last Time Bought (if applicable), or the item’s regular Unit Price.</p>
<p style="margin-left: 36.00pt;">If 'Special Pricing' is in effect, the Discount Percent field is set to zero.</p>
<p style="margin-left: 36.00pt;">Special Pricing is in effect if and only if both the following are true:</p>
<p style="margin-left: 72.00pt;">The Client Site’s Price Code Id (on the Client Site's Contacts tab) is completed.</p>
<p style="margin-left: 72.00pt;">The line's Inventory Item has a Pricing Exception for that Price Code (on the Inventory Item's Pricing tab).</p>
<h2>15.6 Return Authorization</h2>
<p>In previous releases, when a Serialized Item was returned to stock via Return Authorization /AR Sales Credit Memo, it could not be selected for resale; this problem has been corrected.</p>
<h2>15.7 Inventory Receipts Journal / COP Dropships</h2>
<p>When a COP Drop-shipped item is ‘unreceived’ in the Inventory Receipt Journal (by setting the quantity received back to 0.00), the system now properly updates the data so that the item cannot be invoiced.</p>
<p>The message "warning: quantity received exceeds quantity on order" now appears if you generate an additional entry for a COP Dropship that was already received.&#160;&#160;Exiting the entry at this point will prevent over-receiving.</p>
<h2>15.8 COP Drop Ship Purchase Orders</h2>
<p>In this release, the system will use the sys-viewer-vprchseordrlst registry's sqlShipToWorkSite option (if available) to set the Shipping Address when COP Dropship PO's are first generated. For PO's generated in this version and about, it is no longer necessary to change the PO's Ship-To field to WorkSite to obtain the properly formatted address.</p>
<h1>16 Service Management</h1>
<h2>16.1 Registry</h2>
<h3>16.1.1 &#160;Start Work Order Daily Edit</h3>
<p>To enhance the performance of this function, by default it will escalate the work order only when necessary.&#160;&#160;That is, only when either the Technician Id or Work Order Log Type Id gets changed.</p>
<p>The following registry restores pre-5194 behavior for anyone experiencing unexpected results with the new code in place.</p>
<p style="margin-left: 36.00pt;"><font style="font-weight: bold;">Id:</font> sys-start-swrkordrdlyedt</p>
<p style="margin-left: 36.00pt;"><font style="font-weight: bold;">Setting Key:</font> EscalateAlways <font style="font-weight: bold;">Setting Value:</font> true (default is false)</p>
<h3>16.1.2 Require Customer PO for Create PM Work Orders</h3>
<p><font style="font-weight: bold;">Id:</font> sys-start-scrtepmwo</p>
<p><font style="font-weight: bold;">Setting Key:</font> RequirePO &#160;<font style="font-weight: bold;">Setting Value:</font> true (default is false)</p>
<p>In this release, this setting controls the initial setting of each Checklist line's Do box.&#160;&#160;If a site requires a PO and this registry setting is enabled, the Do box defaults to False (blank) when the Customer PO is unknown.</p>
<p>When the Check All sidebar button is clicked and the RequirePO option is set to true, the system now only checks lines where the PO # is completed.</p>
<h3>16.1.3 Registry to Reset Computed Work Orders:</h3>
<p>This registry addresses the following scenario. A group of work orders are review and set to invoice ready in the morning, but not yet printed. Later in the day, a user changes one of these work orders (from the work order itself, or other viewers such as the Job or Labor Journals. Finally, the service invoices are printed and posted – but the one that was altered now differs from what was approved earlier that day.</p>
<p>The following global setting option forces an ‘Invoice Ready’ work order back to the 'Invoice Review' status if it is changed.</p>
<p style="margin-left: 48px;"><span style="font-weight: bold;">TechAnywhere Note:</span> The TechAnywhere Post now ignores this registry setting which interrupted the post in previous releases. &#160;</p>
<p style="font-weight: bold;">Id: sys-ffv-global-settings</p>
<p><font style="font-weight: bold;">Setting Key:</font> ResetComputedWorkOrdersWhenChanged <font style="font-weight: bold;">Setting Value:</font> true (default is false)</p>
<p>If this registry is implemented, the following message will appear when an Invoice Ready work order is changed:</p>
<p style="margin-left: 36.00pt;">This action requires setting Work Order ###### to Invoice Review. Is it Ok to reset the work order’s status?</p>
<p>If the user clicks Yes, the work order will be reset and the change will be allowed. If the user clicks No, the change is denied.</p>
<h3>16.1.4 Dispatch Board Registry Setting Enhancement</h3>
<p>The filterstatusremove (in sys-viewer-vdsptchbrd) key does not allow some of our users to remove enough statuses from user access in the dispatch board. This release extends multiple registry line support to the filterstatusremove key:<br />
<br />
Id: sys-viewer-vdsptchbrd<br />
Setting Key: filterstatusremove&#160;&#160;Setting Value: status1,status2,status3<br />
Setting Key: filterstatusremove&#160;&#160;Setting Value: status4,status5,status6</p>
<p>…. And additional lines as needed</p>
<h3>16.1.5 Specify Vendor Id for Taylor UWO</h3>
<p>As part of the UWO, Taylor's part number for a part must be reported. Previously, this could only be obtained from the Inventory Item Vendor table using the Inventory Item's default Vendor. This release provides a registry option to identify the SAMPro Vendor Id for Taylor, so that this does not have to be set as the Default Vendor for each Taylor part.</p>
<p>Registry Id: sys-taylor-uwo</p>
<p>Setting Key: VendorIdForTaylor Setting Value: <font style="font-style: italic;">taylorvendorid</font></p>
<p>The Setting Value should specify the actual Vendor Id for Taylor in your system.</p>
<h3>16.1.6 Registry to Escalate Web Logs by Service Category</h3>
<p>This new registry setting enables the Escalation Profile attached to Web Logs to be set by Service Category. If enabled, this registry overrides the sys-weblog-escalation registry which enables setting the Escalation Profile by Branch.</p>
<p><font style="font-weight: bold;">Registry Id:</font> sys-start-sschdldevntmngr<br />
<br />
To Turn on this feature enter the following option:</p>
<p><font style="font-weight: bold;">Setting Key:</font> EscalateWeblogsByServiceCategory <font style="font-weight: bold;">Setting Value:</font> true<br />
<br />
For Each Service Category add a separate line:</p>
<p><font style="font-weight: bold;">Setting Key:</font> SC_<font style="font-style: italic;">ServiceCategoryId</font> <font style="font-weight: bold;">Setting Value:</font> <font style="font-style: italic;">EscalationProfileId</font></p>
<p style="margin-left: 36.00pt;">Example:</p>
<p style="margin-left: 36.00pt;">Setting Key: SC_HVAC Setting Value: STANDARD</p>
<h3>16.1.7 Registry to Prompt or Automatically Display Call Master Contract Pane</h3>
<p><img src="image/SKIN1_showMCP.gif" alt="image\SKIN1_showMCP.gif" title="image\SKIN1_showMCP.gif" width="94" height="28" border="0" /></p>
<p>This new sidebar button toggles the New Call display between the Client Site (middle) pane and the new Master Contract pane. A Client Site must be selected before clicking the button. The new Master Contract pane displays all Contracts associated with the selected Site. Contracts are listed in descending order of the Master Contract Date End. Doubling-clicking on a Contract list will open the Master Contract record.</p>
<p style="font-weight: bold;">Registry Entry to Automatically Display or Prompt User to See the Master Contract Pane</p>
<p style="margin-left: 36.00pt;">Id: sys-newcall<br />
Setting Key: ShowMasterContract Setting Value: prompt or automatic<br />
<br />
A Setting value of prompt means a Prompt will appear asking if you want to see the new Master Contract pane when a Site is selected.<br />
<br />
A Setting value of automatic means no Prompt will appear and the new Master Contract pane will automatically appear when a Site is selected.</p>
<h3>16.1.8 Write Service Tasks and/or Service Parts List to New Call Work Orders</h3>
<p>This enhancement enables the Service Parts and/or Service Tasks Lists to be written to the Work Order Equipment Tab’s Work Requested, regardless of the Work Order Type selected. In previous releases, the Service Tasks List was ONLY written to New Call Work Orders of type Installation. This new registry also pertains to Work Orders from TechAnywhere and Web Logs.</p>
<p>Note: if both registries below are enabled, the service task list should be written first, a line of space, followed by the service parts list.</p>
<p><font style="font-weight: bold;">Id:</font> sys-newcall</p>
<p><font style="font-weight: bold;">Setting Key:</font> ServiceParts&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;<font style="font-weight: bold;">Setting Value:</font> workrequested</p>
<p>If this registry option is enabled, the system will write ALL Service Parts from the Equipment record's Service Parts List to the Work Order Equipment Tab’s Work Requested, regardless of the Work Order Type being created. If this registry setting is enabled, the Service Parts Id will also be written to the Work Order Equipment line.</p>
<p><font style="font-weight: bold;">Setting Key:</font> ServiceTasks&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;<font style="font-weight: bold;">Setting Value:</font> workrequested<br />
<br />
If this registry option is enabled, the system will write the Service Tasks from the Equipment record's Service Task List to the Work Equipment Tab’s Work Requested, regardless of the Work Order Type being created. If this registry setting is enabled, the Service Tasks&#160;Id will also be written to the Work Order Equipment line.</p>
<h3>16.1.9 Option to Display the GLH Tab on the Work Order</h3>
<p>The GLH tab is not shown on the Work Order by default since it contains potentially sensitive pay information. The following registry may be used to enable the GLH tab on the Work Order viewer for a user that should have access to this feature:</p>
<p><font style="font-weight: bold;">Registry Id:</font> sys-viewer-vwrkordr-<font style="font-style: italic;">branchid-userid</font> or sys-viewer-vwrkordr--<font style="font-style: italic;">userid’</font></p>
<p><font style="font-weight: bold;">Setting Key:</font> ShowGLH <font style="font-weight: bold;">Setting Value:</font> true</p>
<h3>16.1.10 &#160;Control Display of WO Tabs on the Master Contract</h3>
<p>This registry option may be implement to determine which work orders appear on the Open and Other Work Order tabs by the use of a valid SQL expression. &#160;</p>
<p><font style="font-weight: bold;">Registry Id:</font> sys-viewer-vmstrcntrct</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: bold;">Setting Key:</span> WorkOrderWhereClauseOpen &#160;<span style="font-weight: bold;">Setting Value:</span> <span style="font-style: italic;"><i>valid SQL expression</i></span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: bold;">Setting Key:</span> WorkOrderWhereClauseOther &#160;<span style="font-weight: bold;">Setting Value:</span> <span style="font-style: italic;"><i>valid SQL expression</i></span></p>
<p style="text-decoration: underline;">Example:</p>
<p>Setting Key: WorkOrderWhereClauseOther &#160;Setting Value: wrkordr_stts_ctgry not in ('Open','Archived')</p>
<h3>16.1.11 Display Employee Name on Work Order Revenue Tab</h3>
<p>The Employee Name no longer appears on the Work Order Revenue Tab to prevent sensitive pay information from being displayed. The following registry entries may be enabled so that the user or users eligible to see this information may have access to it.</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: bold;">Registry Id:</span> sys-viewer-vwrkordr-<font style="font-style: italic;">branchid-userid</font> or &#160;sys-viewer-vwrkordr--<font style="font-style: italic;">userid</font></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: bold;">Setting Key:</span> ShowEmployeeNames &#160;<span style="font-weight: bold;">Setting Value:</span> true</p>
<h3>16.1.12 Default Vendor when Importing Required Resources from JCH Budgets</h3>
<p><span id="BugEvents91">By default, when Required Resources are imported to a Work Order from Job History Budgets, the Inventory Item's Vendor is not defaulted. The following entry enables the WO Required Resource I</span><span id="BugEvents101">mport from Job History Budgets to default the Vendor if one is specified in the inventory Item.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: bold;">Registry Id:</span> <span>sys-ffv-global-settings</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: bold;">Setting Key:</span> <span>DefaultRequiredResourceVendorFromJCHBudgets</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: bold;">Setting Value:</span> <span>true (default is false)</span></p>
<h3><span id="BugEvents311">16.1.13 &#160;Default</span> Quantity Billable in Return to Inventory and Fill Lines Wizards</h3>
<p>If an Inventory Adjustment is generated as a result of running the Work Order's Return to Inventory Wizard or the Inventory Adjustment's Fill in Lines Wizard, the Quantity Billable will only default from the Quantity if the following registry entry is enabled.</p>
<p>If this registry is enabled, when you import costs in the Work Order that were generated via this function, the line will specify a negative quantity AND a negative billable quantity. If this registry entry is not set, the billable quality will be zero when it is imported. &#160;In either case, the user may adjust the billable quantity on the imported line. <span style="font-weight: bold;">&#160;</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: bold;">Registry Id:</span> sys-viewer-vinvntryadjstmnt</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: bold;">Setting Key:</span> QtyBillableEqualsQtyReturned &#160;&#160;<span style="font-weight: bold;">Setting Value:</span> true</p>
<h3>16.1.14 Renew Service Contract:</h3>
<p>If the sys-start-srnwsrvcecntrct registry's AdvanceJobDateOpened option is set to true, the Job's ‘Start Date’ (if set) will one again be advanced one year when the renewal is run.</p>
<h3>16.1.15 Registry to Display Unreleased PO's On the Work Order Purchase Tab</h3>
<p>By default, Unreleased PO's do not appear on the Work Order's Purchases tab. The following registry entry allows the Unreleased POs to be included.&#160;&#160;Since Unreleased PO's do NOT post to IM History, Unreleased PO line details will NOT be shown.&#160;&#160;The user will see a single line identifying basic PO information, with ' Purchases Not Itemized - in the Description. The Status column will indicate that the Purchase Order is Unreleased.</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: bold;">Registry Id:</span> sys-viewer-vwrkordr</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: bold;">Setting Key:</span> ShowUnreleasedPOs &#160;&#160;Setting Value:true &#160;(default is false)</p>
<h3>16.1.15 Set Tax Type on Revenue Adjustment Management Fees</h3>
<p>The Revenue Adjustment Table allows you to define Labor, Material, Other and Subcontract adjustments, AND a Management Fee. The posting type of the Management Fee is determined by the Cost Category. In previous releases, the Sales Tax Type of the Management Fee was always set to n/a, regardless whether the Cost Category was taxable or not for the Quote or Work Order's Sales Tax Group. &#160;In this version, the following registry setting may be used to set the Revenue Adjustment Tax Types for Management Fees in both the Quote and the Work Order.</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: bold;">Registry Id:</span> sys-ffv-global-settings</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: bold;">Setting Key:</span> &#160;SetTaxTypeManagementFees &#160;&#160;<span style="font-weight: bold;">Setting Value:</span> true &#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;(default false)</p>
<h3>16.1.16 Show RININV4 Invoices on WO Invoices Tab</h3>
<p>In Version 8.0.510.023 and up, the Invoice Description, Balance and Last Payment Date were added to the Work Order Invoices tab. Unfortunately, this resulted in RININV4 type invoices not displaying on the tab. In this release, the Invoices tab will now first tries to show SERVICEINVOICE type invoices WITH the new columns. &#160;If there are there are NO SERVICEINVOICE type invoices found and the following new registry setting is in effect, the system will then show RININV4 type invoices WITHOUT the new columns.</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: bold;">Registry Id:</span> sys-viewer-vwrkordr</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: bold;">Setting Key:</span> ShowRININV4Invoices &#160;&#160;<span style="font-weight: bold;">Setting Value:</span> true &#160;&#160;</p>
<h3>16.1.17 Require A Unique Customer PO# in New Call</h3>
<p>When implemented, this registry option requires that the clients PO# entered in New Call is unique for the selected Site. The system validates the number you enter against existing work orders for the selected Site. The user will be alerted if the PO# entered is not unique, and will not be able to create the work order in New Call until a unique PO# has been entered. &#160;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: bold;">Registry Id:</span> sys-newcall</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: bold;">Setting Key:</span> RequireUniquePO &#160;<span style="font-weight: bold;">Setting Value:</span> true (default false)</p>
<p>It is recommended that the above option is used in conjunction with the following to make the PO# a required field in New Call:</p>
<p style="margin-left: 48px;"><span style="font-weight: bold;">Registry Id:</span> sys-start-snwcll &#160;(note that the registry id is different!)</p>
<p style="margin-left: 48px;"><span style="font-weight: bold;">Setting Key:</span> requiredFieldsParent &#160;&#160;<span style="font-weight: bold;">Setting Value:</span> wrkordr.po</p>
<h3>16.1.18 Control Statuses Impacted by Work Order Invoice Processing</h3>
<p>In Version 8.1, we added 'Wait Paperwork' to the list of statuses that are changed to Invoice Ready if the Invoice Ready box is flagged. Unfortunately, this impacted some users negatively, since they used it to indicate that they are waiting for paperwork to allow a WO to be invoiced a second time.&#160;&#160;</p>
<p>In this release the default statuses that are changed to Invoice Ready if the Invoice Ready box is flagged have been changed back to completed, invoice review, and invoice approved. The following registry may be used to define the list of statuses that should be included in the Invoice Ready processing.</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: bold;">Registry Id:</span> sys-ffv-global-settings</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: bold;">Setting Key:</span> ValidLogTypesForInvoiceReadyProcessing</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: bold;">Setting Value:</span> list of statuses</p>
<p style="margin-left: 48px; text-decoration: underline;">Example: (returns wait paperwork to the list)</p>
<p style="margin-left: 48px;">Setting Key: ValidLogTypesForInvoiceReadyProcessing &#160;&#160;</p>
<p style="margin-left: 48px;">Setting Value: completed,invoice review,invoiceapproved,wait paperwork</p>
<h3>16.1.19 Turn Off Rn Caching in Scheduled Event and Escalation Manager</h3>
<p>This new option should be enabled if the email addresses in Contact records are frequently changed. By default, the Scheduled Event Manager will only load the Account Manager (or other records accessing Contact information) ONE time in a session. &#160;After that initial load, subsequent changes to the loaded Contact information are not picked up by the system unless the Scheduled Event Manager is rebooted. &#160;The following registry settings turn off the default caching for the Scheduled Event Manager/Escalation Manager; information needed to create the scheduled event (such as the Account Manager's Contact Email) will be evaluated when the scheduled event is generated.</p>
<p>Depending on the issue, one or both settings may be implemented:</p>
<p style="margin-left: 48px;">Scheduled Event Manager handles initial Web Log creation.&#160;&#160;</p>
<p style="margin-left: 48px;">Escalation Manager handles everything else - other Web Log processing, and Work Order escalations.</p>
<h5>Turn off Caching in the Scheduled Event Manager:</h5>
<p style="margin-left: 48px;"><span style="font-weight: bold;">Registry Id:</span> sys-start-sschdldevntmngr</p>

<h3>16.1.20 Create PM WOs - Single Equipment Per WO</h3>
<p>This release corrects a problem encountered when the registry to generate separate PM Work Orders by equipment was enabled:</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: bold;">Id:</span> sys-start-scrtepmwo<br />
<span style="font-weight: bold;">Setting Key:</span> SingleEquipmentPerWO &#160;&#160;<span style="font-weight: bold;">Setting Value:</span> true&#160;</p>
<p>In previous releases, if multiple lines for the same date/tech/job existed on the Equipment's PM Schedule tab, individual PM Work Orders were generated for each line. &#160;In this release, multiple PM Schedule lines for the same date/tech/job will be grouped on the same PM Work Order when this registry option is enabled.</p>
<h3>16.1.21 Set Default Job By Equipment Id</h3>
<p>If the sys-viewer-vwrkordr registry has the DefaultJobByEquipmentId&#160;set to true and the WO Type is NOT Preventive Maintenance, the default job should be set from the Equipment record rather than the WO header. This release corrects a problem on the Inventory and Other tabs where the Equipment's Job did not default correctly if a single piece of Equipment was on the Work Order. &#160;&#160;</p>
<h3>16.1.22 Start Work Order Daily Edit</h3>
<p>It is possible to inadvertently run this function for many more work orders than the user intended. In this release, when the Go button is clicked on the initial range screen, the user will be prompted with a message specifying the number of records that will be processed:</p>
<p>WARNING: #### records have been selected for adjustments.<br />
Press Yes to continue or No to cancel.</p>
<p>In addition, a registry entry is also available to limit the number of records which may be selected for processing on the Checklist screen.</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: bold;">Registry Id:</span> &#160;sys-start-swrkordrdlyedt</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: bold;">Setting Key:</span> MaxWorkOrderCount &#160;&#160;&#160;<span style="font-weight: bold;">Setting Value:</span> <span style="font-style: italic;"><i>maxnumberofrecordsallowed</i></span></p>
<p>We recommend setting this registry to 500 as a starting point. It is possible that firms with extremely large PM runs may need to set this value somewhat higher.</p>
<p style="margin-left: 48px;"><span style="font-weight: bold;">Setting Key:</span> MaxWorkOrderCount &#160;&#160;&#160;<span style="font-weight: bold;">Setting Value:</span> 500</p>
<p style="margin-left: 48px;">When this registry is enabled and the number of selected lines exceeds the registry setting, the system will display a message similar to the following when the Go button is clicked on the checklist screen:</p>
<p style="margin-left: 48px;">ERROR: 556 Records have been selected for adjustments.<br style="page-break-before: always;" />
This process is limited to 500 records.<br />
You must select fewer records before proceeding.</p>
<p style="margin-left: 8px;">Once the user deselects enough records to meet the limit, clicking the Go button will process the Work Orders.</p>
<p>&#160;</p>
<h2>16.2 Reports/KPI's</h2>
<h3>16.2.1 New Table to Support Reporting / KPI's</h3>
<p>A new internal table (mstrclntsteeqpmntpm) has been added to simplify reporting/KPI's for future PM inspections as defined in Master Contracts.&#160;This table is automatically created during data conversion if the following registry is enabled. &#160;The contents of the new table are affected by: saving Master Contract records, saving Site Equipment records, generating PM Work Orders, running Start Renew Service Contract, running Start Renew Master Contract and running Create New PM Work Schedule from Old. &#160;The system will confirm that the following registry is in effected before updating the Master Contract Future Inspections table. &#160;</p>
<p style="margin-left: 48px;">Id: sys-ffv-global-settings<br />
Setting Key: CreateMasterSiteEquipmentPMTable &#160;&#160;Setting Value: true</p>
<h5>New Function: Start Rebuild Master Contract Future Inspections</h5>
<p>This new starter function has no input options. &#160;It does a complete rebuild of the mstrclntsteeqpmntpm table. It is recommended that it be run after hours. This function should be run if you need the new table for your KPI's. The above registry should be enabled before running this function.</p>
<h3><span style="font-weight: bold;">16.2.2 Schedule Report</span></h3>
<p>The Technician Id field was increased from 10 to 15 characters in 8.2. This release, along with the revised Schedule Report (RSCHDLERPRT.rpt) dated 4/17/2014 or later supports this change. Note: the report itself continues to display only the first 10 characters of the Technician Id due to space constraints.</p>
<h3>16.2.3 Work Order Field Ticket Standard (woticket-db.rpt)</h3>
<p>The revised report dated 2016-02-25 adds an option to Skip PO Summary. In addition, Multi-page textbox processing was added for the Work Requested field. &#160;</p>
<h3>16.2.4 Drilldown Service Profitability Component Report</h3>
<p>The revised component report CSERPFT1.rpt dated 2016-09-28 corrects an error when drilling down from the Drilldown Service Profitability report.</p>
<h2>16.3 Master Contract</h2>
<p>Corrects a problem where PM Work Orders and PM Invoices were not generated if the Master Contract Invoice Description (on the Schedule or Advanced Billing tab) contained a apostrophe (single quote).</p>
<p>See Customer Release Note 22 for details on the new APT (Accelerated Payment Technology) Recurring Payment Processing available in this release.</p>
<h3>16.3.1 Main Tab</h3>
<p><span style="font-weight: bold;">Changed Fields: &#160;Account Manager - Sales Rep</span><br />
These fields are now accessible to the user. &#160;In previous releases, they were display-only.</p>
<p><font style="font-weight: bold;">New Field: Revenue Values as %:<br /></font>This enhancement enables the user to designate the Revenue specified on the PM Schedule line of a master contract as a percentage instead of a dollar amount for Time Of Service Bill invoices. If TimeOfService Bill is not specified, the Amount Billed on the Adv. Bill tab will be calculated as a percentage. If Amortization is enabled, the Amount Earned is also calculated as a percentage.</p>
<p>When generating Time of Service PM Work Orders or PM Billings, the system will calculate the billable amount for as a percentage of the annual contract amount specified on the Client Site list. Amortized amounts will similarly be generated using the Amount Earned percentage in the Adv. Bill tab.</p>
<p>When the user saves the record, the system will verify that the sum of the Revenue percentages totals 100.00.</p>
<p style="font-weight: bold;">New Field: Schedule Hours as %<br />
<span style="font-weight: normal;">If this field is flagged, the system will treat the Hours on the Schedule tab as a percentage field and calculate the estimated hours as a percentage of the Total Site Hours on the site tab. The estimated hours will be distributed across any equipment lines added to the subsequent PM work order so that the total estimated hours for the PM work order equals the calculated percentage hours.</span></p>
<p>The following fields are used in conjunction with this field:</p>
<p style="margin-left: 48px;"><span style="font-weight: bold;">Site List Tab - New Field: Total Site Hours</span><br />
This field allows the total estimated hours to been assigned on a Site by Site basis. This field is used in conjunction with the new Schedule Hours as % field on the Main tab.</p>
<p style="margin-left: 48px;"><span style="font-weight: bold;">Schedule Tab - Changed Field: Hours</span><br />
If the Schedule Hours as % field on the Main Tab is flagged, the system will treat this field as a percentage field and calculate the estimated hours as a percentage of the Total Site Hours on the Site List &#160;tab. Validation has been added to ensure that the total hours on this tab sum to 100.00 (100%) if the Schedule Hours as % field is flagged.</p>
<p style="margin-left: 48px;"><span style="font-weight: bold;">Setup Renew Tab - Changed Button: Autopopulate</span><br />
If the Schedule Hours as % field on the Main Tab is flagged, clicking this button will populate the Schedule Tab with the 100% of hours evenly divided among the inspections; they may be adjusted by the users. &#160;</p>
<h3>16.3.2 Filter Tab</h3>
<p><font style="font-weight: bold;">New Range: Site Name</font><br />
The Client Site Name has been added to the Filter tab. The Filter tab enables you to auto-populate the sites included in this contract by filling in one or more of the following ranges, and then clicking the Auto Populate button.</p>
<h3>16.3.3 Schedule Tab</h3>
<p>The system now allows changes to all Schedule tab fields except the Month and Day even though Equipment PM lines already exist. This allows fields (such as the Work Code) to be changed now so they will be correctly set for the following year.</p>
<h3>16.3.4 PM Invoices</h3>
<p>Client Site Billing Schedule lines already include a 3000 character Extended Description field.&#160;&#160;When creating new Billing Schedule lines from Master Contracts, the system now sets the line's Extended Description to the associated Billing Item's Invoice Description.</p>
<h3>16.3.5 Master Contract Future PM Inspection Schedule Table</h3>
<p>A new table has been implemented to simplify reporting/KPI’s of future PM inspections as defined in the Master Contracts.&#160;This table is maintained by the system, and is created during a database conversion to version 8.2. Contents of the new table are affected by saving/adding Master Contracts and Site Equipment records with PM Schedules: a progress bar will appear briefly notifying the user of the update. The new table is also updated when generating PM Work Orders.</p>
<p>This release corrects updates to the table generated when Equipment and the Master Contract Records are changed. The Master Contract’s new Menu option Tools&gt;Rebuild Inspections re-syncs the mstrcntrcteqpmntpm table if it has incorrect entries. Run this function after hours since it can take a long time to complete!</p>
<p>A registry entry is available to disable the use of this table if it as not required for KPI's or other reporting: see Customer Note 21.1.1 for details</p>
<h3>16.3.6 Setup/Renew Tab</h3>
<p><span style="font-weight: bold;">Contract Amount:</span><br />
Corrects a problem where the Contract Amount setup amount was sometimes incorrectly reset when the Auto Fill button was clicked. &#160;In this release, this field now correctly lists the Amount as the Total Contract Value divided by the # of Sites on the Sites List if the Master Contract is not flagged as Time of Service Earned.</p>
<h2>16.4 Work Codes</h2>
<p><font style="font-weight: bold;">New Fields: Work Code User1-5</font><br />
These fields may be used to record additional information required by your company.</p>
<h2>16.5 &#160;Log Forms</h2>
<p>The Log Form Id has been expanded from 5 to 15 characters.</p>
<p><font style="font-weight: bold;">Log Form</font> <font style="font-weight: bold;">User 1-5:<br /></font>These fields may be used by TechAnywhere assist in filtering records for TechAnywhere access, or for entering any information your company wishes to retain.</p>
<p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">&#160;</p>
<h2>16.6 PCR (Problem, Cause, Remedy)</h2>
<h3>16.6.1 PCR Overview</h3>
<p>The purpose of the new Problem, Cause, Remedy functionality is to enforce consistency between the Problem reported (the Work Code), the Cause of the problem (the new Cause Code), and the Remedy (the Resolution Code). This consistency is enabled via the new PCR Table which defines which Causes may be selected for each Work Code (Problem), as well as which Remedy (Resolution) Code may be selected for each Cause Code.</p>
<p>In SAMPro, if a PCR table is referenced in the Equipment Record, Work Codes are validated in:</p>
<p style="margin-left: 36.00pt;">1. New Call<br />
2. Work Order<br />
3. Dispatch Board<br />
4. Client Site Equipment (PM Schedule tab)<br />
5. Quote – Main Tab (if a lead work order is used, the Work Code defaults from it.<br />
<br />
SAMPro validates that Cause Codes are associated with the PCR table Work Code in:<br />
1. PCR Table<br />
2. Work Order<br />
<br />
The system validates that the Resolution Code is associated with the PCR Cause Code in the Work Order.</p>
<p>TechAnywhere also supports the PCR validations.</p>
<h3>16.6.2 Cause Code (new record)</h3>
<p style="font-weight: bold;">Purpose:</p>
<p>This record may be used to identify the cause of a problem identified by a Work Code. For example, a typical Work Code for an air conditioning unit might be No Cool. A variety of causes (defined by the Cause Code) could have led to this problem: Belt, Filter, Blower, Compressor, and so on.</p>
<p>Cause Codes do not have to be specific to a particular work code. In this example, they could also be applicable to a Work Code of No Heat.</p>
<p style="font-weight: bold;">Usage:</p>
<p>Referenced in the PCR Table and Work Order.</p>
<p style="font-weight: bold;">Important Fields:</p>
<p><font style="font-weight: bold;">Cause Code Id:<br /></font>This required field uniquely Identifies this cause (e.g., Belt, Filter, CondCoil, Compressor, etc.).</p>
<p><font style="font-weight: bold;">Cause Code Name:<br /></font>This recommended field may be used provide greater detail on the cause (e.g., if the Id is EVAPCOIL the Name could be Evaporator Coil). This field may also be used for reporting purposes.</p>
<p><font style="font-weight: bold;">Obsolete?<br /></font>If this field is checked, the record is considered Obsolete, and it may not be directly specified during data-entry (either by entering the Id or selecting it from a list). Obsoleted records can be edited and the Obsolete option can be undone when necessary. When you check the Obsolete field, the following message box will be displayed:</p>
<p style="margin-left: 36.00pt;">“You have elected to obsolete this record. Would you like to see existing references to this record?”</p>
<p>If you click Yes, the system will display a viewer that provides click-through access to all tables referencing this record.</p>
<h3>16.6.3 PCR Table</h3>
<p style="font-weight: bold;">Purpose:</p>
<p>The purpose of the new PCR Table is to enforce consistency between the Problem reported (the Work Code), the Cause of the problem (the Cause Code), and the Remedy (the Resolution Code). This consistency is enabled via the PCR Table’s Problems tab which defines which Causes may be selected for each Work Code (Problem), and by the Remedies tab which defined which Remedy (Resolution) Code may be selected for each Cause Code.</p>
<p>This field is completed in the Equipment record to implement this functionality.</p>

<p><font style="font-weight: bold;">Important Fields:</font> <font style="font-weight: bold;">Lower Section</font></p>
<p class="Tab">Problem Tab</p>
<p>This tab defines which Causes may be selected for each Work Code (Problem).</p>
<p><font style="font-weight: bold;">Work Code Id: Cause Code Id:<br /></font>Each line defines a valid problem/cause pair. Each Work Code (problem) may be listed multiple times if has multiple causes. For example, a No Cool problem could be caused by a refrigerant leak, electrical outage, and so on.</p>
<p class="Tab">Remedies Tab</p>
<p>This tab defines which Causes may be selected for each Work Code (Problem).</p>
<p><font style="font-weight: bold;">Cause Code Id: Resolution Code Id::<br /></font>Each line defines a valid cause/remedy pair. Each Cause Code may be listed multiple times if has multiple resolutions. A Control Cause Code might be associated with remedies (resolution codes) of Repair or Replace.</p>
<p>When you double-click to select a Cause Code, the list will be limited to those that appear on the Problem tab; only Cause Codes that appear on the Problems tab should be included on the Remedies tab.</p>
<h3>16.6.4 Changed Records – PCR Implementation</h3>
<p style="font-weight: bold;">Client Site</p>
<p style="margin-left: 36.00pt;"><font style="font-weight: bold;">Client Site Other WOs Tab:</font> The Cause Code and Resolution Codes (from the Work Order Equipment lines) have been added as columns.</p>

<p><font style="font-weight: bold;">Work Order:</font> <font style="font-weight: bold;">Work Order Equipment Tab:</font></p>
<p style="margin-left: 36.00pt;"><font style="font-weight: bold;">Changed Field: Work Code Id:<br /></font> If PCR functionality is enabled, the system will validate the Work Code is specified in the PCR Table (in the Client Site Equipment) when a Work Code is entered or changed. The PCR Table in the Client Site Equipment record overrides the PCR Table in the Client Site record.</p>
<p style="margin-left: 36.00pt;"><font style="font-weight: bold;">New Field: Cause Code Id:<br /></font>This field may be used to specify the cause of the problem defined by the Work Code. If PCR functionality is enabled, the system will validate that the Work Code / Cause Code pair is specified in the PCR Table when a Cause Code is entered or changed.</p>
<p style="margin-left: 36.00pt;"><font style="font-weight: bold;">Changed Field: Resolution Code Id:<br /></font> This field may be used to specify the resolution of the problem defined by the Work Code/Cause Code. If PCR functionality is enabled, the system will validate that the Cause Code/Resolution Code pair is specified in the PCR Table when a Resolution Code is entered or changed.</p>
<p style="font-weight: bold;">Quote:</p>
<p style="margin-left: 36.00pt;"><font style="font-weight: bold;">Changed Field: Work Code Id:<br /></font> This field defaults from the lead work order if one is specified.</p>

<p style="margin-left: 36.00pt;"><font style="font-weight: bold;">Changed Field: Work Code Id:<br /></font> If PCR functionality is enabled, the system will validate the Work Code is specified in the PCR Table (in the Client Site Equipment) when a Work Code is entered or changed. If a PCR Table is specified in the Client Site Equipment record, it overrides the PCR Table in the Client Site record.</p>
<p style="font-weight: bold;">Classic Dispatch Board Summary:</p>
<p style="margin-left: 36.00pt;"><font style="font-weight: bold;">Changed Field: Work Code Id:<br /></font> If PCR functionality is enabled, the system will validate the Work Code is specified in the PCR Table (in the Client Site Equipment) when a Work Code is entered or changed.</p>
<p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">&#160;</p>
<h2>16.7 Work Order Viewer</h2>
<p>When the DefaultJobByEquipmentId registry is enabled, Labor Journal lines imported from Job History via the regular Import Costs retain their Job info instead having it reset to the Equipment default.</p>
<p>Corrects a problem where the Create PO button launched the Purchase Order with child lines from an existing PO; this occurred if the user had returned to the List view after editing the PO. Also corrects a problem generating PO's when the user switches security. &#160;</p>
<p>The Get Costs Button now fills in the serialized fields when importing serialized inventory costs; the prevents a validation problem when the user attempted to complete them for inventory which was bought to a PO and then returned to stock.</p>
<p>When a Flat Rate is imported, an 'Other' line with the Flat Rate price and Description should also be imported. &#160;In previous releases, this line was only imported if the Flat Rate had a non-zero price at the selected level. In this version, this line is imported for all Flat Rates.</p>
<p>If the sys-viewer-vwrkordr registry setting OkToBillWithOpenPOs is set to false, a WO cannot be set to Invoice Ready if the PO is not fully received. This release corrects the checking of serialized items so that the WO can be set to Invoice Ready when all serialized (and other items) are fully received.</p>
<p>Previously the user was prevented from creating a PO via the CreatePO or RR Wizard buttons if the header Job was closed. An exception is now made for PM's (Type = PreventiveMaint): the user is warned that the job was closed as of a certain date, but is allowed to create the Purchase Order.</p>
<p>This release prevents Revenue Adjustments Tab Mismatch errors that could occur it a PM Work Order was billed and then posted to from Quotemaster. Note that this fix prevents this problem in future PM's, but will not correct existing problems (the Tab Mismatch error must be corrected by support).</p>
<p>New validation prevents the user from importing costs after deleting the WO Id.</p>
<p>This release corrects a sporadic problem where the Closing Call Script Loaded flag was not always set when the Closing Call Script was run.</p>
<p>Validation requires a Header Job when importing a Flat Rate.</p>
<p>When a Flat Rate is imported into a PM Work Order (Type PreventiveMaint), the Job information now defaults from the WO header. Previously, no Job information defaulted.</p>
<p>In previous releases, if a user accessed a work order with tech lines previously set to ‘completed’ and then marked the work order Invoice Ready, the spurious message “Warning: not all Technician Lines are set to completed, invoice ready, or invoice review. Are you sure you want to set to invoice ready?” would appear. This has been corrected so that the message not longer appears when it should not.</p>
<h3>16.7.1 Work Order GLH Tab</h3>
<p>This release Implements a new GLH parent tab in journals that post to GL History; see Customer Release Note 16.1.9 for the registry needed to display this tab.</p>
<h3>16.7.2 Work Order Equipment Tab</h3>
<p>See user release note 16.6.4 (above) for changes to this tab to support PCR processing.</p>
<h3>16.7.3 Work Order Revenue Tab</h3>
<p>Double-clicking on a WO Revenue Tab line will now open the applicable Labor Journal, AP Journal, Job Journal, Purchase Order, Inventory Receipts Journal, or Inventory Adjustments Journal entry if access to the viewer is enabled for the user.</p>
<h3>16.7.4 COD Payments Child Tab</h3>
<p><font style="font-weight: bold;">Changed Field – GL Entity:<br /></font>This display-only field now defaults from the Job in the Work Order header is now defaulted in. You must click the Magnify button to see this field.</p>
<h3>16.7.5 Work Order Technician Status</h3>
<p>A new work order log type status, Parts Pickup, has been added. It follows Return Trip in the Escalation hierarchy, as shown below. A new WO Escalation Status of Parts Pickup has also be added.</p>

<h3>16.7.6 Work Order Purchases Tab</h3>
<p>The Inventory Item Id is now included in the Description field (ItemId~Description) to avoid confusion if a General and Inventory Item have the same Description.</p>
<p>PO's with Subcontractor lines are once again displayed on this tab. Released, 'shell' PO's also appear on the Purchases tab with the Description set to ' Purchases Not Itemized'.&#160;By default, Unreleased PO's do not appear on this tab. See Customer Release Note 16.1.15 for a registry to also display Unreleased PO's on this tab.</p>
<p>The PO Status has been added as the rightmost column in the Purchases List.</p>
<p>For Credit PO's, the Purchases tab now shows zero if the item has not been received, or the applicable negative number if it has been received. Previously, all Credit PO’s displayed as received.</p>
<p>The Date Promised for each purchase line is now shown on this tab in the Promised column.</p>
<p>A new column, Confirming, has been added to this tab. This column will be set to Yes if the PO’s Confirming? box is checked, or No if it is clear. This column allows for easy communication between the parts manager and the service department. If a PO is flagged as Confirming, it indicates that the parts manager has already delivered the PO to the vendor. If it is not flagged as Confirming, this operation needs to be completed.</p>
<h3>16.7.7 Work Order Inventory Tab</h3>
<p><font style="font-weight: bold;">Serialized</font> <font style="font-weight: bold;">Inventory:</font> Validation of serial numbers entered on this tab has been revised to prevent the addition of a new line that includes a second reference to the same item (e.g., AB1 and ab1). SAMPro now treats 'AB1' and 'ab1' as equivalents, and displays the appropriate error message which states the "Serialized Inventory Item has already been used".<br />
<br />
<font style="font-weight: bold;">Serialized Inventory:</font> If a user puts the wrong WO# on the PO, existing validation makes it difficult to correct the error. In this release, a serialized item may be 'removed' from the work order by adding a -1.00 serialized WO-INV line with the Serial number already in the current WO-INV list. The serialized item is returned to stock in the location specified in the negative line.</p>
<p style="margin-left: 36.00pt;">You cannot remove an imported serialized WO-INV item from another work order with this method. If you attempt to do so, the following message will appear: “A Quantity of -1 should only be used to reverse a serialized item that has been imported to this work order.”</p>
<p>Previously, purchasing a serialized item directly to a work order ONLY used the standard cost. In this release, the costing type in the Item record will be used to compute the cost.</p>
<p>In previous releases, if an approved Quote had a quantity greater one for a serialized inventory item, it imported into the work order correctly but erred on invoicing due to the serialized line having a quantity not equal to one. In this release, the serialized restrictions on Quoted lines have been relaxed to allow invoicing with a quantity greater than one.</p>
<p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">&#160;</p>
<p><font style="font-weight: bold;">Changed Field: Inventory Id:<br /></font>The system now checks to see if a part has been superceded (the Superceded By field on the Inventory Other Tab is filled in). When a superseded part number is entered into this field, the system will alert the user that</p>
<p style="margin-left: 36.00pt;">Item A has been superceded by Item B. Use New Item?</p>
<p>It the user clicks Yes, the new part (B) will be returned to the field. If the user clicks No, part A (which has been superceded) will remain in the field.</p>
<h3>16.7.8 Work Order Required Resources Tab</h3>
<p>Corrects a 'Receiver is not a boolean' error which occurred if the user accessed a Work Order and then immediately clicked the RR Wizard or Import RR button. &#160;&#160;</p>
<p>See Customer Release Note 16.1.12 for a registry option to default the Vendor from the Inventory Item when importing Required Resources from JCH Budgets.</p>
<p>Lines cannot be added manually if the WO is on credit hold. In addition, the buttons MaterialReq, ImportRR and ReleaseRR cannot be used if the Work Order is on Credit Hold.</p>
<p>This release eliminates a ‘key is missing’ error that occurred if the system did not locate an applicable base or branch-specific sys-viewer-vshpordr registry entry. A sporadic 'error currentfieldcheck not understood' in the Import Required Resource Wizard has also been corrected.</p>
<p><font style="font-weight: bold;">Changed Field: Inventory Id:<br /></font>The system now checks to see if a part has been superceded (the Superceded By field on the Inventory Other Tab is filled in). When a superseded part number is entered into this field, the system will alert the user that</p>
<p style="margin-left: 36.00pt;">Item A has been superceded by Item B. Use New Item?</p>
<p>It the user clicks Yes, the new part (B) will be returned to the field. If the user clicks No, part A (which has been superceded) will remain in the field.</p>
<p><font style="font-weight: bold;">Changed Fields: Quantity Available and Quantity On-Hand:<br /></font>On the Required Resource tab, Quantity On-Hand and Available calculations now use branch-specific Material Requisitioning registry entries (sys-viewer-vshpordr-<font style="font-style: italic;">branchid)</font> when available. The Branch Id on the WO’s Main tab is used to determine the Branch.</p>
<h3>16.7.8a Option to Default Vendor when Importing Required Resources</h3>
<p>The Import RR button on the WO Required Resource Tab displays a prompt screen to enable the user to import Required Resources from either Job History or an external spreadsheet (.cvs file). A new Option, Use Default Vendor, has been added to the prompter screen for both the Job History and Spreadsheet imports. This option would generally not be used if full-fledged requisitioning (Start Material Requisitioning) is enabled. &#160;&#160;See Customer Release Note 13.1.3 for a registry to flag this field by default.</p>
<h3>16.7.8b Required Resource Equipment Defaulting</h3>
<p>When Required Resource lines are imported from JCH (job history budget entries), the Equipment Id is now defaulted in the same way as for manual entries:</p>
<p style="margin-left: 48px;">If only one piece of equipment appears on the Equipment tab, this field will default.<br />
If multiple Id’s are listed on the Equipment tab, the Equipment Id will not be defaulted during the import, but may be selected by the user on the imported line.</p>
<h3>16.7.8c Required Resource Wizard</h3>
<p>When the RR Wizard is run, non-inventory items entered with and without a Vendor appear. &#160;Previously, if you did not select a Vendor, the non-inventory item was not written to a Purchase Order, but was flagged as Requisitioned, thereby blocking any other edits. In this release, only those lines actually written to a PO are flagged as Requisitioned.</p>
<h3>16.7.8d &#160;Registry to Import Required Resource Costs from JCH (Job Budget)</h3>
<p>By default, when Required Resources are imported to the Work Order from JCH, the cost from the Work Order's Staging location is used. See Customer Release Note 13.1.2 for a registry to use the Cost from the Job Budget tab instead.</p>
<h3>16.7.8e Recent Required Resource Changes</h3>
<p style="margin-left: 8px;">When an Inventory Item is added, the Job Cost Category defaults from the Inventory Item's Group record. The Cost Category must be of Type Material.</p>
<p style="margin-left: 8px;">If items are not transferred to the Inventory tab when the record is saved with the 'Picked' flag set, the transaction will be rolled back. If this functionality is being used, it is strongly suggested that the AdjustDefaultDateOrPeriod registry (in sys-viewer-vwrkordr) is set to date to avoid errors during the picked processing.</p>
<h3>16.7.9 Work Order Invoicing Tab</h3>
<p><span style="font-weight: bold;">Invoicing Tab Changed Field - Billing Agent Id:</span><br />
Due to popular demand, this field may once again be set by the user. &#160;Recall that if this field is blank, it is automatically populated with the current user's id when the OK to Invoice button is pressed and the work order is saved.</p>
<p>To disable this field to prevent user entry, the following registry should be enabled:</p>
<p style="margin-left: 48px;">Id: sys-viewer-vwrkordr<br />
Setting Key: disabledFieldsParent &#160;&#160;Setting Value: bllngagnt: usr.id</p>
<p><font style="font-weight: bold;">First Date Worked: Last Date Worked:<br /></font>These display-only fields are extracted from Job History based on the earliest and latest non-zero labor entries associated with this Work Order. Only actual labor hours are included: “quoted” labor is not included in the calculation.</p>
<p><font style="font-weight: bold;">Changed Field: Invoice Ready<br /></font>When the user flags a Work Order as Invoice Ready, the system now includes the Wait Paperwork status among those tech statues (Completed, Invoice Ready, Invoice Review) that will be automatically changed to Invoice Ready. The user will also be warned if some technician lines are not set to ''Completed'', ''Invoice Review'', ''InvoiceApproved'', or ''Wait Paperwork'’ when a work order is flagged as invoice ready.</p>
<p><font style="font-weight: bold;">Changed Field: Date Work Completed</font><br />
If the global registry option DateWorkCompletedToday was set to true, the Date Work Completed was always set to today then the work order was ‘completed’. In this release, it is only set to Today if it is blank. If this registry is not enabled, the Date Work Completed will always be derived from the most recent date on the Technicians tab when it is considered completed.</p>
<p>Note that a Work Order is considered ‘completed’ if:</p>
<p style="margin-left: 36.00pt;">At least one Tech line is set to 'completed', 'wait paperwork', 'invoice ready' or 'invoicedisputed')</p>
<p style="margin-left: 36.00pt;">AND</p>
<p style="margin-left: 36.00pt;">The WO Escalation Status Category is to 'completed' or 'pending Ok to invoice')</p>
<h3>16.7.10 Work Order Labor Tab</h3>
<p style="margin-left: 8px;">This release refines the validation rules for work dates relative to Accounting Period Dates so that changes to actual hours are allowed if the applicable Payroll / Accounting / Accrual periods are active and the Technician has not been paid. Changes to Billable Hours and revenue-related fields are allowed if the line has not been invoiced. As with previous releases, all changes to lines generated from Quote Master are denied if the registry setting DenyChangesToQuoteMasterLines is enabled in the sys-viewer-vwrkordr registry.</p>
<p>Delete Line and Insert Line <span style="text-decoration: underline;"><u>with</u></span> Copy are denied if:</p>
<p style="margin-left: 48px;">The Payroll Period is Inactive<br />
The Payroll Period's Accounting Period is Inactive and the Effective Date is in the Accounting Period<br />
The Payroll Period's Accrual Period is Inactive and the Effective Date is in the Accrual Period</p>
<p style="margin-left: 48px;">(a blank line may be inserted if any of the above apply)</p>
<p>If the Hours worked is zero, the system no longer validates that the effective date falls within the Pay Period date range.</p>
<p><font style="font-weight: bold;">Approving Time:<br /></font>This functionality enables users to review/approve time entered in TechAnywhere, indicating that this time does not need to be reviewed prior to billing. To do so, right-click on a line. No special user attribute is required: all that is needed is for someone other than the tech to ‘touch’ the entry.</p>
<p>Three registry entries are required for this functionality: please see user note 17.1 for details: one to split TechAnywhere time into separate labor journals by work order, and another two to allow approval in the Work Order and Labor Journals.</p>
<h3>16.7.11 Work Order Quote Tab</h3>
<p><font style="font-weight: bold;">New Column – Scope WO<br /></font>The Work Order Id (from the Quote Scope line) now appears on the new Scope WO column. This column will only be completed when the approval wizard has been successfully run for that option.</p>
<h3>16.7.12 Work Order List View</h3>
<p>A new List view sort order, WorkOrderbyWorkOrderbyTechnician has been added. The following columns are displayed:</p>
<p style="margin-left: 48px;">WO Id - &#160;<span id="BugEvents40">Tech Id - Work Code Id - Escalation Status - Site Alpha - Date Opened</span><br />
<span>Date Scheduled - Dispatcher Id - Work Requested -</span> Service Zone Id - Site Id</p>
<p>Note that the Escalation Status is the status of the Work Order, not the individual Technician Tab.</p>
<p>The 'WorkOrdersByBranchIdByWorkOrderId' list now shows only one line per Work Order.&#160;&#160;The Work Order Escalation Status, WO PO, Client Id and Client Name have been added to this list.</p>
<h3>16.7.13 Work Order Technicians Tab</h3>
<p>The system now allows multiple lines on the Work Order Technician tab with the same Tech Id and Date but a different Time Scheduled. This functionality is compatible with TechAnywhere 3.0.048.006+. A change to the Work Order table indices is required for current 8.2 installations wanting to make use of this new feature; contact your support departed to arrange for this change. &#160;</p>
<p>The field previously labeled Log Type Id: is now labeled Tech Status: to better reflect its meaning. The database field name (wrkordrlgtype_id) has not been changed.</p>
<p><img src="TimeSlotWiz.gif" alt="" style="border: none;" border="0" /> Click the new Select Time Slot button to launch a Wizard to select or change the Time Slot on this line.</p>
<h3>16.7.14 Work Order Log Tab</h3>
<p>The field previously labeled Log Type Id: is now labeled Tech Status: to better reflect its meaning. The database field name (wrkordrlgtype_id) has not been changed.</p>
<h3>16.7.15 Work Order Import Costs Wizard</h3>
<p>This release refines the import of requisitioned items when the User's and the WO's Branches are not the same.</p>
<p>This release corrects an error when selecting the Equipment Id on the Inventory screen.</p>
<p>In previous releases, the following scenario could occur:</p>
<p style="margin-left: 36.00pt;">Quote is created. It has an Inventory item that specifies a Vendor.</p>
<p style="margin-left: 36.00pt;">Quote is approved and PO is generated.</p>
<p style="margin-left: 36.00pt;">If the line is imported into the WO using the conventional import process, the line does not have a Qty Billable amount on it.</p>
<p style="margin-left: 36.00pt;">If the WO Import Wizard is used, it does. When invoicing, even though the line is not marked as an extra, the imported line will show on the invoice.</p>
<p>In this release, the WO Import Wizard no longer sets the Quantity Billable in this situation so that the imported line will not appear on the invoice.</p>
<p><font style="font-weight: bold;">Note:</font> Quotes should always be posted with a Fixed Fee Billing Item to avoid double invoicing for items imported from a purchase order. The following registry entry should be set to enforce this:</p>
<p style="margin-left: 36.00pt;"><font style="font-weight: bold;">Registry Id:</font> sys-viewer-vqte</p>
<p style="margin-left: 36.00pt;"><font style="font-weight: bold;">Setting Key:</font> ApprovalWizardRequiresFixedFeeBillingItem <font style="font-weight: bold;">Setting Value:</font> true</p>
<p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">&#160;</p>
<h3>16.7.16 Work Order – Inventory Return Wizard</h3>
<p><img src="image/Return_To_Inventory.gif" alt="image\Return_To_Inventory.gif" title="image\Return_To_Inventory.gif" width="80" height="28" border="0" /></p>
<p style="font-weight: bold;">New Button: Return To Inventory</p>
<p>This button is designed to help you return inventory items entered on a Job or Work Order to your stock location. This button currently supports only the transaction type of Job-to-Loc. When this Transaction Type is selected, clicking the button will launch the Wizard.</p>
<p>The Return to Inventory Wizard warns the user (WARNING: Job XXX was closed on MM-DD-YYYY) if the WO header's Job's Date Closed is not blank or greater than today.</p>
<p>In this release, the Wizard does NOT set the Revenue when the Billing Item is Fixed Fee and not flagged as Extra.</p>
<p style="font-weight: bold;"><span style="font-weight: normal;">As much as possible, the actual costs/revenues of the items eligible for return will be used by the wizard so that the original transaction can, in effect, be undone. If an inventory item was brought into the work order at different costs/revenues, the wizard will reflect this and display more than a single line for the part. &#160;Additional fields are displayed to help the user distinguish which item(s) should be returned to inventory:</span></p>
<p style="margin-left: 8px;">The Wizard uses the Equipment originally charged (from Job History) &#160;whenever possible. The global registry option (Setting Key: DefaultEquipmentFromWorkOrder &#160;Setting Value: false) is ignored by the wizard.</p>
<p style="font-weight: bold; text-decoration: underline;">Fill Lines Wizard: Options Screen</p>
<p style="margin-left: 36.00pt;"><font style="font-weight: bold;">Work Order Id:<br />
Job Id:<br />
<span style="font-weight: normal;">The system will complete the Work Order Id when the Wizard is launched from the Work Order.</span></font></p>
<p style="margin-left: 36.00pt;"><font style="font-weight: bold;">Location Id:<br /></font>This required field defines the Location to which the Inventory should be returned. It defaults from the Work Order but may be changed by the user if needed.</p>
<p style="margin-left: 36.00pt;">Click the Next button at the bottom of the screen to continue.</p>
<p style="font-weight: bold; text-decoration: underline;">Fill Lines Wizard – Items Screen</p>
<p style="margin-left: 36.00pt; font-weight: bold;">Inventory Item Id: &#160;Quantity:<br />
<span style="font-weight: normal;">These display-only fields default from Job History for Inventory Items already associated with the selected Job / Work Order that are eligible for return to inventory.</span></p>
<p style="margin-left: 36.00pt;"><font style="font-weight: bold;">To Return:<br /></font>Enter the quantity of the selected Inventory Item to return to the Location. If this item should NOT be returned to the Location, leave it set to zero.</p>
<p style="margin-left: 36.00pt;"><span style="font-weight: bold;">To Keep:</span><br />
This field initially indicates the quantity associated with the Job / Work Order. It is automatically decreased by the amount the user enters in the To Return field.</p>
<p style="margin-left: 36.00pt; font-weight: bold;">Invoiced:<br />
<span style="font-weight: normal;">This field displays the quantity of this item that has already been invoiced.</span></p>
<p style="margin-left: 36.00pt;"><span style="font-weight: bold;"><font style="font-weight: bold;">S</font>erial / Lot Id:<br /></span>If a serialized item was recently added to the work order, the system will be able to complete this field for you because it was recorded in Job History. &#160;If the item was added in an earlier release, the serial number must be carefully entered by the user if it is to be returned.</p>
<p style="font-weight: bold; margin-left: 48px;">Equipment Id: &#160;Inventory Name: &#160;Extra: &#160;Qty Bill: &#160;&#160;Bill Type Id: &#160;Revenue Rate:<br />
<span style="font-weight: normal;">Unit Price: &#160;TOT Revenue: &#160;Unit Cost:<br />
These display only fields reflect the Job History for items on this work order/job.</span></p>
<p style="font-weight: bold; margin-left: 48px;">InvoiceId: To Unbill:<br />
<span style="font-weight: normal;">If this line has been invoiced, the Invoice Id will be completed. &#160;If you set the To Return quantity for this line, the To Unbill: field will default from it if the registry entry option to set the Quantity Billable from the Quantity Returned is enabled.</span></p>
<p style="font-weight: bold; margin-left: 48px;">Serial No. From (JCH Serial No?):<br />
<span style="font-weight: normal;">If the Serial Number on this line was completed by the system based on it's value in Job History, this box will be flagged. &#160;If the Serial Number entered manually by the user, the box will be clear.</span></p>
<p>Click the Finish button to complete the Wizard. When you do so, the Inventory Adjustment Entry will be saved automatically, and you will be returned to the Work Order viewer. In the Work Order, the Get Costs button allows the user to import this transaction into the Work Order.</p>
<h3>16.7.17 Evaluation Tab</h3>
<p style="margin-left: 8px;"><span id="BugEvents201">Technician Evaluation questions are added to the work order based on the Equipment and Tech selected during New Call. Often, the Tech Id changes after the WO is created, but in previous releases the system didn't update the Evaluation lines on the WO so that they were associated with the new Tech.</span></p>
<p style="margin-left: 8px;">In this release, If the primary Tech changes, the system re-evaluates entries on the Evaluation tab as follows:</p>
<p style="margin-left: 48px;">Existing lines for the selected Evaluation Table with responses for the previous Primary Tech are retained.</p>
<p style="margin-left: 48px;">Existing lines with &#160;'unknown' response are deleted for the previous Primary Tech are deleted. &#160;</p>
<p style="margin-left: 48px;">A complete set of lines for the new primary Tech (as applicable for a Vendor/Employee tech) is added.</p>
<h3>16.7.18 Work Order Escalation Tab</h3>
<p>Double-clicking on the Escalation tab drills down to the selected Event record.</p>
<h3>16.7.19 Work Order Signature Tab</h3>
<p>This obsolete tab has been removed from the Work Order default view. The following registry may be enabled to display it (at the right of the Work Order viewer) if needed.</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: bold;">Registry Id:</span>&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;sys-viewer-vwrkordr</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: bold;">Setting Key:</span> ShowSignatures &#160;&#160;<span style="font-weight: bold;">Setting Value:</span> true</p>
<h3><span style="font-weight: bold;">16.7.20 Work Order Gross Margin Tab</span></h3>
<p>In this release, Revenue Adjustment 'Prepaid' lines are ignored when making the Gross Revenue calculations.</p>
<h3>16.7.21 Work Order Other Tab (Detail view)</h3>
<p><span style="font-weight: bold;">Changed Fields: &#160;Asset Id - Other Rate Id:</span><br />
If the Other Rate in the Asset Record is blank, it does not overwrite a manually entered Other Rate when the user enters the Asset Id.</p>
<h3>16.7.22 Work Order Revenue Adjustments Tab</h3>
<p>This release closes a loophole which allowed the user to delete billed Revenue Adjustments immediately after invoicing a Work Order. The user is also prevented from indirectly deleting billed lines via the Adjust Revenue button on Gross Margin tab.&#160;</p>
<p>This release extends the restrictions on editing/deleting &#160;'special' PM Accrual-type Revenue Adjustment lines to include the old-style lines. &#160;</p>
<p style="margin-left: 48px;">New style lines have an Invoice Description that ends with '*ACCRUAL*'.<br />
Old style lines have an Invoice Description of either 'PM Income' or 'PM Billed in Advance'.</p>
<h2>16.8 Dispatch Board</h2>
<p>The system now allows multiple lines on the Work Order Technician tab with the same Tech Id and Date but a different Time Scheduled. This functionality is compatible with TechAnywhere 3.0.048.006+. A change to the Work Order table indices is required for current 8.2 installations wanting to make use of this new feature; contact your support departed to arrange for this change. &#160;</p>
<p>This release corrects a sporadic “[ODBC SQL Server Driver] Connection is busy with results for another hstmt” error encountered by some users.</p>
<h3>16.8.1 Work Order List (lower section)</h3>
<p>The new Create Date column displays the date the Work Order was created. This column will initially appear at the extreme right-hand side of the board, but may be repositioned via drag and drop. &#160;</p>
<p>The Begin Date column has been relabeled as Scheduled to better reflect its meaning as the Technician’s Date Scheduled. After the data-conversion, the Scheduled column will end up in the same place at the Begin Date did before in the user’s Dispatch Boards.</p>
<p>The Client Name (from the WO’s Job) has been added as a column; this column will initially appear at the extreme right-hand side of the board, but may be repositioned via drag and drop.</p>
<h3>16.18.2 Create PO Button</h3>
<p>Previously, if the user was editing an existing PO and then clicked this button, the system would open a blank PO form, losing any unsaved changes on the PO. The user is now warned that changes to the PO have not been saved, and is given the option to return to the existing PO and save the changes.</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: bold;">Support for Intercompany Processing:</span><br />
When a WO is selected and the Create PO sidebar button is pressed, the PO viewer will be launched with the new GL Entity field on the Status tab set from the PO’s Location (which also defaults from the Work Order). The Work Order Id will be completed in the PO header as in previous versions.</p>
<h3>16.18.3 Classic / Day Boards</h3>
<p>When the Time Chart is displayed, only those Work Orders for the selected Tech will appear.</p>
<p>Corrects a problem in recent releases where the user could not always scroll to the extreme right-hand cells of the Classic board, or the bottom cells of the Day board.</p>
<p>The Work Order Summary of the Classic / Day Board now displays the Dispatch Note from the Client Site record below the Work Order Comments field.</p>
<h3>16.18.4 Dispatch Board Filter Tab</h3>
<p>If multiple dispatch boards are in use, each will now properly maintain its own filters (requires the SaveRanges and PreferencesByBoard registry options). In previous releases, opening a different dispatch board set its filters to the ones you previously changed.</p>
<p>The top range field previously labeled Log Type Id: is now labeled Tech Status: to better reflect its meaning.</p>
<h3>16.18.5 Dispatch Board E-mail Form</h3>
<p><span style="font-weight: bold;">New Field: Contact Id</span><br />
The Contact Id gives the user access to SAMPro Contact records and the email addresses contained in them. When a Contact record is selected, SAMPro automatically inserts its main email address in the Email To field.&#160;&#160;In addition, when the Contact record contains multiple addresses, they are added to the list of Email Addresses displayed when the user double-clicks in the Email To or CC fields. This will allow the SAMPro user to select one of the Contact's secondary email addresses.</p>
<h3><span style="font-weight: bold;">16.18.6 Work Order Summary</span></h3>
<p>If you right-click a Work Order on the Dispatch Board and select "Update Workorder", the Work Order Summary is displayed. &#160;This release corrects a "Key is Missing" when clicking the Save button in the Work Order Summary viewer.</p>
<h2>16.9 New Call</h2>
<p>The message saying there are Notes attached only displays if active (non-obsoleted) note(s) are attached to the selected Site.</p>
<p>Corrects Credit Hold processing when the Job does not default from the selected equipment.</p>
<p>The Market Source defaults for the selected Site correcting an issue introduced in 8.2.545.047.</p>
<p>This release corrects the defaulting of the Market Source from the Site's Contacts tab when the Site uses a COD template Job in the New Call and New Call 2 windows.</p>
<p>This release corrects a non-continuable protection violation error that could sporadically occur when changing the Search For button from Alpha to Any.</p>
<p>Selecting a Work Code no longer resets the Job ID back to the Equipment’s default Job. &#160;</p>
<p>The Work Order User 1 Field in New Call supports the double click Custom Field functionality.</p>
<p>If the Service Category field is completed, double-clicking the Work Code field once again displays a list that is automatically filtered to only active work codes referencing that service category.</p>
<h3>16.9.1 New Call – New COD Site</h3>
<p>Corrects a display issue where the Technician, Date and Time were not initially displayed when they were set from TechFinder.</p>
<p>Improved error message if a new COD Site is not created.</p>
<h3>16.9.2 Other Lines Auto-generated from Client Site WO Other Tab</h3>
<p>When a work order is created, and an Other line is automatically generated from the Client Site's WO Other tab, the appropriate GL History entries will be generated if the Accounting Period’s WO Other to GL box is flagged.</p>
<p>To determine the correct Accounting Period, the system will look at the date to use on the WO Other line (either the date scheduled, or today's date if there is no scheduled date). If the date is with the default Accounting Period, it will use that. If the date is NOT within the default Accounting Period, it will find the appropriate active Accounting Period and use that.</p>
<h3>16.9.3 Web Log</h3>
<p>When a TechAnywhere Weblog is entered in New Call, the Work Code / Service Category only defaults if the Weblog itself specifies a Work Code. Previously, the Work Code defaulted from the Weblog's original Work Order if a Work Code was not specified in the Weblog itself.</p>
<p>When a Web Log with the Equipment Id set from TechAnywhere is processed in New Call, it does not automatically select the Equipment (although the Site will be still be selected).</p>
<p>A Web Log's scheduled events are now re-evaluated when it is used to created a work order in New Call (via SAMPro or TechAnywhere) and the Web Log's status is changed from unacknowledged to acknowledged.</p>
<h3>16.9.4 Master Contract Pane</h3>
<p><img src="image/SKIN1_showMCP.gif" alt="image\SKIN1_showMCP.gif" title="image\SKIN1_showMCP.gif" width="94" height="28" border="0" /></p>
<p>This new sidebar button toggles the New Call display between the Client Site (middle) pane and the new Master Contract pane. A Client Site must be selected before clicking the button. The new Master Contract pane displays all Contracts associated with the selected Site. Contracts are listed in descending order of the Master Contract Date End. Doubling-clicking on a Contract list will open the Master Contract record. See user note 16.1.7 for a registry to prompt or automatically display this pane.</p>
<h3>16.9.5 Work Order Type</h3>
<p style="font-weight: bold;">New Work Order Type - Requisition:<br />
<span style="font-weight: normal;">"Requisition" should be used ONLY for the purpose of requisitioning materials for installation / construction jobs and should not be used for service or PM work orders. When the Work Order is specified as Requisition, running Start Tech (Work Order) Material Pickup creates a Loc-to-Job transfer instead of transferring the materials to a location (typically, the Tech's truck).</span></p>
<h3>16.9.6 New Call New Site (Flashlight)</h3>
<p style="font-weight: bold;">Changed Field - Contact 1 Email:<span style="font-weight: normal;"><br />
In this release, the system also writes the Contact 1 Email field to the Client Site Email Address field when the Site is created.</span></p>
<h2>16.10 Resolution Code</h2>
<p style="font-weight: bold;">New Fields:</p>
<p><font style="font-weight: bold;">Resolution</font> <font style="font-weight: bold;">Code User 1-5:<br /></font>These optional fields may be used for entering any information your company wishes to retain.</p>
<p><font style="font-weight: bold;">Obsolete?<br /></font>If this field is checked, the record is considered Obsolete, and it may not be directly specified during data-entry (either by entering the Id or selecting it from a list). Obsoleted records can be edited and the Obsolete option can be undone when necessary. When you check the Obsolete field, the following message box will be displayed:</p>
<p style="margin-left: 36.00pt;">“You have elected to obsolete this record. Would you like to see existing references to this record?”</p>
<p>If you click Yes, the system will display a viewer that provides click-through access to all tables referencing this record.</p>
<h2>16.11 Refrigerant Tracking</h2>

<h2>16.12 Web Log</h2>
<p>This release corrects display issue where the Work Code Id disappeared if the viewer was refreshed. &#160;The Service Category has been removed from the screen; it is not a part of this record and contributed to the display problem.</p>
<p><font style="font-weight: bold;">New Field: Technician Id</font>:<br />
If this Web Log was generated by a Technician or Subcontractor user, the Technician Id and Name will appear in this display-only field. A new v.cus file will be needed to see this field if your upgrade to this version did not trigger a database conversion.</p>
<p><font style="font-weight: bold;">New Field: Equipment Id:</font><br />
The Web Log viewer now displays the Equipment Id (if set from TechAnywhere). When a Web Log with the Equipment Id set is processed in New Call, it does not automatically select the Equipment (although the Site will be still be selected).</p>
<h2>16.13 Create PM WOs</h2>
<p>The Branch Prefix prepends to the Invoice WO Id (if set via registry).</p>
<p>If WO Inventory lines are generated from the ServiceParts list, their Description&#160;field is now completed from the Inventory Item's Name. Note that lines are only written to WO Inventory under certain registry settings configurations. &#160;</p>
<p>Corrects a recent problem in the Checklist screen where un-checking a line NOT associated with a Master Contract resulted in that line being deleted from the Site Equipment PM Schedule.</p>
<p>Validation prevents multiple users from updating the same records with this function.</p>
<p>PM's associated with Master Contracts now pull in the most recent Invoice # for that Master Contract on the Site PM Billing tab. &#160;If a PM is NOT associated with a Master Contract, it pulls in the most recent Invoice # NOT associated a Master Contact on the Site Billing schedule.</p>
<p>Corrects a problem where PM Work Orders and PM Invoices were not generated if the Master Contract Invoice Description (on the Schedule or Advanced Billing tab) contained a apostrophe (single quote).</p>
<p>This release corrects a 'key is missing' error when running Create PM Workorders where one of PM’s will be for a Sub, and a PO needs to be generated.</p>
<p>See user release note 16.1.2 for a registry to controls the initial setting of each Checklist line's Do box to set it to False (blank) if a site requires a PO and the Customer PO is unknown.</p>
<h3>16.13.1 Range Screen</h3>
<p style="font-weight: bold;">New Fields:</p>
<p><font style="font-weight: bold;">Default Tech Id:<br /></font>The Default Tech Id will default to the Checklist screen if the Tech id on the PM Work Order would have been blank (unassigned). It will not override a Technician assigned from the Equipment record’s PM Schedule tab, the Equipment record’s Main tab, or the Client Site.</p>
<p><font style="font-weight: bold;">Work Requested:<br /></font>If completed, this field defaults to the following Checklist screen. It will set the Work Requested header field and the Work Order Equipment's Work Requested &#160;(followed by Service Tasks / Parts text if applicable) of the generated PM work order. This field has been expanded to allow the users to view/enter additional text.</p>
<h3>16.13.2 Checklist Screen</h3>
<p>Corrects a problem where checking the Already Done box without tabbing out of the field did not generate the NO WO tag in the Equipment's PM Schedule line.</p>
<p>When the Check All sidebar button is clicked and the RequirePO option is set to true in the sys-start-scrtepmwo registry, the system now only checks lines where the PO is completed.</p>
<p style="font-weight: bold;">New Fields:</p>
<p><font style="font-weight: bold;">Tech Id:<br /></font> This field defaults from the previous Range screen (if the Tech id on the PM Work Order would have been blank. Otherwise, it will default from Equipment record’s PM Schedule tab, the Equipment record’s Main tab, or the Client Site. It may be adjusted by the user if needed.</p>
<p><font style="font-weight: bold;">Work Requested:<br /></font>This field defaulted from the previous Range screen, but may be adjusted by the user if needed. &#160;It will be used to set the Work Requested header field and the Work Order Equipment's Work Requested &#160;(followed by Service Tasks / Parts text if applicable) of the generated PM work order.</p>
<p><font style="font-weight: bold;">WO PO#:<br /></font>This field usually defaults from the Job and/or Client Site based on the WorkOrderPO option in the sys-start-scrtepmwo registry. It may be adjusted by the user if needed.</p>
<h3>16.13.3 Checklist Screen Warning</h3>
<p style="font-weight: bold;">Changed Field: Already Done</p>
<p>A warning has been added if the user checks the 'Already Done' box in the Create PM Workorders checklist:</p>
<p>Warning: Any Deferred Revenue that should be attached<br />
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;to a work order will NOT be generated if the<br />
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;'Already Done' box is checked.</p>
<p>This warning is designed to alert users to issues that would occur if they are writing deferred Earnings to Revenue using the PM Inspection line's Accrued box and Contract Value fields. &#160;Using these fields attaches a Revenue Adjustment to the PM Inspection Work Order.&#160;&#160;When Work Order is invoiced/posted, the revenue is moved from Deferred Revenue to Revenue. If you use the Already Done check box in because you’ve already created a manual work order in New Call, this transfer of revenue never happens.</p>
<h3>16.13.4 Time of Service Earned Revenue Recognition</h3>
<p>This change pertains to Time of Service Earned Master Contracts (and the equivalent entries on the Client Site Equipment PM Schedule tabs with the 'Accrual' field flagged). &#160;In this release, *ACCRUAL* is used as a special marker when PM Work Orders are generated; these lines no longer post directly to JCH. &#160;When the PM Invoice is printed and posted, the appropriate GL and Job Cost entries will be made to recognize the earned revenue values. This change will prevent new PM work orders generated with Revenue Adjustments marked as '*ACCRUAL*' from generating Tab Mismatch errors when closed from the Dispatch Board. &#160;Validation ensures that Revenue Adjustment lines flagged as *ACCRUAL* may NOT be deleted from the Work Order.</p>
<h2>16.14 Time Slot</h2>
<p><font style="font-weight: bold;">New Field -</font> <font style="font-weight: bold;">Obsolete?<br /></font>If this field is checked, the record is considered Obsolete, and it may not be directly specified during data-entry (either by entering the Id or selecting it from a list). Obsoleted records can be edited and the Obsolete option can be undone when necessary. When you check the Obsolete field, the following message box will be displayed:</p>
<p style="margin-left: 36.00pt;">“You have elected to obsolete this record. Would you like to see existing references to this record?”</p>
<p>If you click Yes, the system will display a viewer that provides click-through access to all tables referencing this record.</p>
<h2>16.15 Technician Viewer</h2>
<h3>16.15.1 Remote Access Tab</h3>
<p><font style="font-weight: bold;">New Field: Last TA Version:<br /></font>This new display-only field shows the most recent TechAnywhere Version number used by the selected Technician. This field is updated every time the tech performs a sync.</p>
<h3>16.15.2 Certification Tab</h3>
<p><font style="font-weight: bold;">New field - Date Earned:<br /></font>This informational field may be used to record the date this Technician earned the Certification. It may be used for reporting purposes.</p>
<h3>16.15.3 Main Tab</h3>
<p><span style="font-weight: bold;">Changed Field - Technician Id:</span><br />
The Technician Id has been expanded from 10 to 15 characters.</p>
<h3>16.15.4 Technician List Viewer</h3>
<p>The Technician Email field has been added to the TechniciansByPhone list.</p>
<h2>16.16 Escalation Manager</h2>
<p>A Web Log's scheduled events are now re-evaluated when it is used to create a work order in New Call (via SAMPro or TechAnywhere) and the Web Log's status is changed from unacknowledged to acknowledged.</p>
<p>If TechAnywhere Web Logs are created with an equipment record, their escalation events are now generated correctly. Restart the Scheduled Event Manager (and other agent-type users) after installing this release so that this fix will be available.</p>
<h3>16.16.1 Handling of Cancelled Work Orders</h3>
<p>Canceling a work order now also cancels existing, non-tech based scheduled events: this prevents messages from continuing to execute for cancelled work orders. In this release, if the Work Order Escalation Status goes to Cancelled, applicable tech-based escalations are run (for example, one notifying the technician the WO was cancelled), and then existing (non-tech based) scheduled events are cancelled.</p>
<h3>16.16.2 Notification Category:</h3>
<p style="font-weight: bold;">Changed Field: Source - Web User option added<br />
<span id="BugEvents2311" style="font-weight: normal;">SAMPro now supports the ability to trigger web log escalation events based on the web log being set to duplicate or cancelled. In this release, the executed event may also be set to notify the requester (web user) by creating a Notification Category with the Source set to Web User. &#160;This Notification Category could then be referenced in an Escalation Profile for Web Logs so that appropriate notifications could be sent to the Web User's Email address.</span></p>
<p>Note that a Web Log's scheduled events are now re-evaluated when it is used to create a work order in New Call (via SAMPro or TechAnywhere) and the Web Log's status is changed from unacknowledged to acknowledged.</p>
<h3>16.16.3 Escalation Profile</h3>
<p><span style="font-weight: bold;">&#160;</span>'Parts Pickup' is now an available status for Escalation Profiles.<span style="font-weight: bold;">&#160;</span></p>
<h3>16.16.4 Work Order Date Work Completed</h3>
<p><span style="font-weight: bold;">T</span>he Date Work Completed is now only set if the overall Work Order Escalation Status goes to &#160;Completed or Invoice Ready. In previous releases, the Date Work Completed was set if only one Tech line was set to Completed, regardless of the overall status.</p>
<h2>16.17 Work Order Daily Edit</h2>
<p style="margin-left: 8px;">This version corrects a performance issue in recent releases.</p>
<p>Previously, clicking the Search Id button in the New Status field dropped the selected Status into the Log Type Id range. The Search Id button now correctly sets the New Status field.</p>
<h2>16.18 Taylor Universal WOs</h2>
<p>Type 3 records are used to report the contents of a Work Order's "Other" and "Labor" tabs. An "<font style="font-weight: bold; text-decoration: underline;">M</font>" (for Material) is entered into the Type 3 "Other" records "Category" field. In this release, an exception to the above is made for PM Work Orders (Work Order Type "preventivemaint"). Type 3 "Other" records deriving from PM Work Orders should have the "Category" field set to "<font style="font-weight: bold; text-decoration: underline;">L</font>" (for Labor).</p>
<h2>16.19 Service Category</h2>
<p><font style="font-weight: bold;">Service Category</font> <font style="font-weight: bold;">User 1-5:<br /></font>These fields may be used by TechAnywhere assist in filtering records for TechAnywhere access, or for entering any information your company wishes to retain.</p>
<h2>16.20 Renew Service Contract</h2>
<p>This release corrects the calculation of the CN Value for Time of Service Billed lines when the user manually adjusts the New Value in the Checklist screen.</p>
<p>This release refines the handling of unchanged PM Billing Contract Amounts to correct differences of a few pennies in the monthly values noted by some users.</p>
<p>This function now renews PM Billing lines marked Ok to Renew even if they do not have an Equipment PM Schedule line (referencing the same job) also marked OK to renew.</p>
<h2><span style="font-weight: bold;">16.21 Start Archive Work Orders</span></h2>
<p>WO's with a blank Date Closed (set to 1900-01-01) are now excluded from this function to prevent open WO's from being inadvertently archived.</p>
<h2>16.22 TechFinder</h2>
<p>This release corrects errors when TechFinder was run from the Dispatch Board or the Work Order Tech tab, and if the Windows localization date settings were set for Canada.</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: bold;">Enhanced Field - Certification Range:</span><br />
If you precede the list of Certification Categories with an ampersand (&amp;), Techfinder will ONLY display the active Technicians who have EVERY certification listed (subject to additional filter criteria). &#160;</p>
<p style="margin-left: 48px; font-weight: normal; text-decoration: underline;">Examples:</p>
<p style="margin-left: 48px; font-weight: normal;">&amp;CERT1,CERT2,CERT3<br />
This returns only active Technicians that have all three Certifications listed in their Technician record.</p>
<p style="margin-left: 48px; font-weight: bold;"><span style="font-weight: normal;">CERT1,CERT2,CERT3<br />
This returns all active Technicians that have any or all of the three Certifications listed in their Technician record.</span></p>
<h2>16.23 &#160;Start Message Table Purge</h2>
<p>This release changes/fixes the following in the Start Message Table Purge function:</p>
<p style="margin-left: 48px;">- Remove orphaned LargeObject records as a result of archiving messages<br />
- Change the default action to purge rather than archive if registry 'DisableArchive' is not set<br />
- Include FMMS message statuses of 'sent' and 'sending'<br />
- Include SageQuest message statuses of 'response'</p>
<h2>16.24 Start Renew Master Contracts</h2>
<p>The function does not support Master Contracts with multiple inspection lines for the same day and month and do not have the Monthly or Day of the Week Inspection boxes flagged. &#160;In previous releases, attempting to do so resulted in the system locking up with the progress bar displayed.</p>
<p>In this release, if Start Renew Master Contracts encounters a Master Contract with this issue, the processing will be stopped and the following message displayed:</p>
<p style="margin-left: 48px;">ERROR: Master Contract (Master Contract Id) has duplicate dates in inspection lines. Correct this error in this Master Contract or clear its Renewable flag and renew it manually. None of the Master Contract in this run have been updated; if multiple Master Contracts were specified, rerun this function after correcting the problem.</p>
<p>The user must correct this issue as indicated in message in order to proceed.</p>
<h1>17 TechAnywhere</h1>
<p>TechAnywhere generated quotes are now created with the correct Security Id (if applicable).</p>
<p>This release supports TechAnywhere’s ability to imitate the SAMPro New Call function to import a weblog to create a work order from it.</p>
<p>This release corrects an issue where an invalid Equipment ID in the refrigerant tracking section crashed the TechAnywhere Post. Now the message is failed if the Equipment ID is not correct.</p>
<p>In this release, the TechAnywhere posting logic now finds and corrects any bogus year values before updating client site equipment. The Year should contain exactly four digits, no decimal points or spaces.</p>
<p>If CODs are not auto-posted, the system no longer auto-increments the AR Invoice counter to reduce ‘skipped’ invoice numbers and eliminate Document references to ‘ghost’ invoices.</p>
<p>This release corrects the duplication of COD payment information when reposting a fixed message.</p>
<p>This release corrects a “Key is missing error” when posting purchase orders from TechAnywhere.</p>
<h2>17.1 Registry</h2>
<h3>17.1.1 Time Review Registries</h3>
<h5>TechAnywhere Time Review</h5>
<p>This functionality enables users to review time entered in TechAnywhere, indicating that this time does not need additional review prior to billing. A custom PR Time Entry report is used to indicate which time has/has not been reviewed. Note that un-reviewed time may be billed for and/or paid to the technician.</p>
<p>To approve time, a user may simply access the Labor Journal, and save the entry (with any corrections needed. Time may also be approved from the Word Order Revenue tab by right-clicking on a line. No special user attribute is required: all that is needed is for someone other than the tech to ‘touch’ the entry.</p>
<p>The three registry entries listed below are required for this functionality: please see user note 17.1 for details: one to split TechAnywhere time into separate labor journals by work order, and another two to allow approval in the Work Order and Labor Journals.</p>
<h5>Post Labor By Work Order</h5>
<p><font style="font-weight: bold;">Id:</font> sys-techanywhere</p>
<p><font style="font-weight: bold;">Setting Key:</font> PostLaborByWorkorder <font style="font-weight: bold;">Setting Value:</font> true<br />
<br />
With this registry setting in place, individual labor journals will be created to break out a journal per work order if multiple work orders are contained in a labor message payload.</p>
<h5>Time Review – Work Order</h5>
<p><font style="font-weight: bold;">Id:</font> sys-viewer-vwrkordr</p>
<p>Setting Key: AllowLaborJournalApproval Setting Value: true</p>
<h5>Time Review – Labor Journal</h5>
<p><font style="font-weight: bold;">Id:</font> sys-viewer-vlbrjrnl</p>
<p><font style="font-weight: bold;">Setting Key:</font> ApproveWhenEdited <font style="font-weight: bold;">Setting Value:</font> true (default false)</p>
<h3>17.1.2 TechAnywhere Discounts</h3>
<p>TechAnywhere 2.7 Android will now create Revenue Adjustment lines based on the discounts the tech took in the field. The following registry option must be implemented to provide the correct cost category for the Revenue Adjustment:</p>
<p><font style="font-weight: bold;">Id:</font> sys-techanywhere</p>
<p><font style="font-weight: bold;">Setting Key:</font> DiscountCostCategory <font style="font-weight: bold;">Setting Value:</font> <font style="font-style: italic;">CostCategoryId of discount</font></p>
<h3>17.1.3 Control CRM Viewable Documents by File Extension</h3>
<p>By default, all documents sent over from TechAnywhere are flagged as CRM Viewable when posted to SAMPro. With this registry setting you can control by file extension if you do not want a certain file type to post with the CRM Viewable flag checked. This is a temporary fix as TechAnywhere will eventually give technician control of the CRM Viewable flag (Old CRM + New FM) for attached collateral.</p>
<p><font style="font-weight: bold;">Registry Id:</font> sys-techAnywhere</p>
<p><font style="font-weight: bold;">Setting Key:</font> NonCRMViewableTypes <font style="font-weight: bold;">Setting Value:</font> list of file type extensions</p>
<p>The Setting Value provides a list of the file extensions that you don't want flagged as CRM Viewable. For example:</p>
<p style="margin-left: 36.00pt;">Setting Key: NonCRMViewableTypes Setting Value: jpg,jpeg</p>
<h3>17.1.4 &#160;Prevent Work Orders Created in TechAnywhere From Being Set to Credit Hold</h3>
<p><span id="BugEvents131">By default, work orders created from TechAnywhere follow the same rules as a SAMPro New Call for setting a work order to Credit Hold. This could prevent a tech from working on an after hours call, since they could not rely on a credit manager to release the work order so the tech can use it in TechAnywhere. The following registry option prevents work orders created from TechAnywhere from being set to credit hold.</span></p>
<p><span id="BugEvents121" style="font-weight: bold;">Registry Id:</span> <span>sys-newcall</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: bold;">Setting Key:</span> <span>DisableCreditHoldForTechAnywhere &#160;</span><span style="font-weight: bold;">Setting Value:</span> <span>true &#160;(default is false)</span></p>
<h3><span>17.1.5 &#160;Handle T</span>echAnywhere PO's Like SAMPro PO's</h3>
<p>In previous SAMPro versions, TechAnywhere created purchase orders were always treated in a unique way. A new method (implemented via registry in 8.2) allows TechAnywhere purchase orders to be generated in the same manner as those created in SAMPro. No TechAnywhere changes are/were required for this new functionality but it may <span style="font-weight: bold;">NOT</span> be implemented if your firm does any COD Work Orders.</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: bold;">Registry Id:</span> sys-viewer-vprchseordrlst</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: bold;">Setting Key:</span> TechAnywherePostingStyle <span style="font-weight: bold;">Setting Value:</span> standard</p>
<p style="font-weight: bold;">DO NOT set this registry for anyone who does any COD Work Orders because the billQTY and price updates from the field have no place to post.</p>
<p>If this registry option is in effect, the following changes will appear in new purchase orders generated from TechAnywhere with the new (Standard) posting style:</p>
<p>Purchase orders are now created with job history (previously were not).</p>
<p>PO's can be imported to the work order just like a SAMPro created purchase order.</p>
<p>Tech can still purchase "X" and still use a different, lesser quantity "Y".</p>
<p>When using less than the original purchased amount, purchase order is edited to change the JobQty and JobQtyRcvd via TechAnywhere post.</p>
<p>The Purchase Order Viewer and Posting have been enhanced to distinguish the difference OLD and NEW TechAnywhere posting styles to manage the limitations in previous posting styles during the migration period.</p>
<h3>17.1.6 Inventory Cost Category - CHANGE TO DEFAULT BEHAVIOR</h3>
<p>In this release, the TechAnywhere post to WO-INV will only use the 'InventoryCostCategoryId' setting of the sys-techanywhere registry if the Default Cost Category from the Inventory Group is blank.</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: bold;">Registry Id:</span> sys-techanywhere &#160;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: bold;">Setting Key:</span> InventoryCostCategoryId &#160;<span style="font-weight: bold;">Setting Value:</span> <span style="font-style: italic;"><i>costcategory</i></span></p>
<h2>17.2 Reports</h2>
<h2>17.3 TechAnywhere Quotes</h2>
<p>This enhancement enables TechAnywhere technicians to submit Open or Declined Quotes and their options to create quotes in SAMPro QuoteMaster. Quote collateral will be attached to the lead Work Order as well as the Quote and Site. All 'web viewable' flags for the collateral will be set to No. The CollateralDirectory defined in sys-techanywhere will be used for the collateral upload.</p>
<p>In TechAnywhere, a “Unit Down” check box has been added to the Scope of Service screen.</p>
<p style="margin-left: 36.00pt;">When the 'Unit Down' field is checked, the new Quote's header Description is set to 'Unit Down’ following by the Tech's Id.</p>
<p style="margin-left: 36.00pt;">If Unit Down not checked and the work order is a Service work order, ‘Found on Service Call by Technician <span style="font-style: italic;"><i>(TechId)</i></span> ' is written to the Quote Description field.<br />
If Unit Down not checked and the work order is a PM work order, 'Found on PM Visit' followed by the Tech's Id will be written to the Quote Description field.</p>
<p>Quotes posted from TechAnywhere can be either Fixed Price or T&amp;M.&#160;For T&amp;M quotes, when a quote detail line does NOT include pricing info (Unit Price, Price = zero), the system will perform the standard revenue rate calculations appropriate for the line.</p>
<h2>17.4 TechAnywhere Purchase Orders</h2>
<p style="margin-left: 8px;">TA-generated POs now set proper Security values when Intercompany is on.</p>
<p style="margin-left: 8px;">The TechAnywhere post now ignores the “No change allowed on PO with a status closed” error when the TA message does not contain any changes to the PO. Previously, this error resulted in the message being failed; this could occur if one of the new TechAnywhere PO's was closed before the Technician completed the work order.</p>
<p style="margin-left: 8px;">Customer Release Note 17.1.5 details a registry to allow TechAnywhere PO's to be generated like SAMPro POs: it may <span style="font-weight: bold;">NOT</span> be implemented if your firm does any COD Work Orders.</p>
<p style="margin-left: 8px;">Enhancement to ensure that General PO lines from TechAnywhere are always unique. This will prevent a posting scenario that caused the "description already entered on another line" message resulting in the purchase order to failing to create.</p>
<p>When Purchase Orders are created in Tech Anywhere, the Confirming? check box is now flagged because they are all confirmed with the parts vendor.</p>
<p>TechAnywhere PO’s with an invalid Vendor ID will not be posted, and an e-mail detailing the error will be sent to support.</p>
<h3>17.4.1 Technician and Part Runner Mode</h3>
<p>The TechAnywhere Android setup will allow a technician to work in 1 of 2 ways: Technician mode or Part Runner mode.</p>
<p style="margin-left: 36.00pt;">In Technician mode, the tech can view purchase orders that contain unreceived items that are associated with any of his assigned work orders. The tech can mark the items received in TechAnywhere, which will create an inventory receipt journal transaction to mark those items received in SAMPro. The tech also has the ability to change the associated site equipment record on the item which will then change the purchase order and purchase order history to reflect the new equipment.</p>
<p style="margin-left: 36.00pt;">In Part Runner mode, the technician has access to ANY purchase order that contains any unreceived items. In this mode, technician does NOT have the ability to change the associated equipment record, but may mark items as received.</p>
<p>Contact your TechAnywhere support rep to enable this feature for your technicians.</p>
<h2>17.5 TechAnywhere Recommendations (Web Logs)</h2>
<p>If TechAnywhere Web Logs are created with an equipment record referenced, their scheduled events are successfully generated in this release. Restart the Scheduled Event Manager (and other agent-type users) after installing this release so that this fix will be available.</p>
<p>This enhancement to the TechAnywhere posting allows recommendations (web logs) to be recorded by equipment. The post is still compatible with the previous TechAnywhere functionality which does not link the service recommendation to the equipment. When a Web Log with the Equipment Id set is processed in New Call, it does not automatically select the Equipment (although the Site will be still be selected).</p>
<h2>17.6 TechAnywhere Flat Rate Imports</h2>
<p>TechAnywhere allows non-integer flat rate quantities which could result in a posting error because only integer Flat Rate quantities were allowed in SAMPro. SAMPro now supports Flat Rate quantities other than integers in Work Orders, Quotes, and the TechAnywhere Post.</p>
<p>The TechAnywhere post now fails the message if trying to post a flat rate to a Work Order that doesn't have a Job.</p>
<h2>17.7 TechAnywhere Table Changes</h2>
<p>For TechAnywhere, it is useful to have customized user fields to assist in filtering records for TechAnywhere access. User Fields 1-5 have been added to the following records to assist with TechAnywhere and for possible other uses:</p>
<p>Labor Rate<br />
Inventory Group<br />
Location<br />
Log Forms<br />
Payment Type<br />
Service Category<br />
Common Phrases</p>
<h2>17.8 TechAnywhere Post</h2>
<p style="margin-left: 8px;">Previously, if the first Equipment line on WO had a blank Equipment Id, TechAnywhere generated PO's failed to post even if subsequent lines included valid Equipment Id's. Lines with blank Equipment are now ignored during the post.</p>
<p style="margin-left: 8px;">This release corrects a Key Is Missing error when a new style TechAnywhere PO was posted in version 8.2.545.071 and up.&#160;&#160;</p>
<p style="margin-left: 8px;">The Log Form Id specified by Techs when creating NEW Equipment records now posts to SAMPro.</p>
<p>TechAnywhere Reimbursable Expenses (Other) and Breaks (TimeLog) now store the correct security ID.</p>
<p style="margin-left: 8px;">Technician opening call scripts are once again written into the Work Order Call Script tab when the Work Order is created from TechAnywhere.</p>
<p style="margin-left: 8px;">The TechAnywhere Post ignores the 'Closing Call Script: Loaded' check box so that each technician may append their closing call scripts to the work order. &#160;</p>
<p style="margin-left: 8px;">Prevents an Invalid Values error when new Equipment is generated with Custom Field validation for the Equipment Name; the system doesn't attempt to set the Equipment Name from the Id.</p>
<p style="margin-left: 8px;">Prevents a "Runtime error: OS Error: The network path was not found" when documents are posted from TechAnywhere where the directory cannot be found and the subdirectory registry option is in effect.</p>
<p style="margin-left: 8px;">TechAnywhere 3.3 supports storing the masked credit card # when processing a credit card from APT. This release updates the Masked CC # in the WO COD tab if TechAnywere post includes this information.</p>
<p style="margin-left: 8px;">Provides an improved error message that occurs if a Flat Rate Id was recently renamed in SAMPro, and the TechAnywhere user selects the old Id (which no longer exists).</p>
<p style="margin-left: 8px;">The Start and Stop Times entered in TechAnywhere are posted to the Labor Journal; these fields are displayed in the Labor Journal and WO Labor tabs (requires customization file). The &#160;'Hours' and 'Bill Hours' fields continue to be completed with the values the Technician selected.</p>
<p style="margin-left: 8px;">TechAnywhere new WO's now choose the correct Service Manager from the Equipment or Site.</p>
<p>In this release, COD payments will post when associated costs have not yet been entered. &#160;</p>
<p>Corrects error creating a WO when the Accounting Period's WO-Other-to-GL field is checked.</p>
<p style="margin-left: 8px;">The TechAnywhere post now skips the job closed warning when generating new work orders.</p>
<p style="margin-left: 8px;">Corrects a defaulting issue where the Tech Id was not always written to Refrigerant Tracking.</p>
<p>The Post now sets the Revenue Adjustment from the Job for WO's created in TechAnywhere.</p>
<p>The Post to the Labor Journal uses WO security if standard Labor Journal logic doesn't override.</p>
<p>New Call posting now ignores the "WARNING: Client Site -- Job relationship is inconsistent." (could occur on &#160;Warranty jobs).</p>
<p>WO's created in TechAnywhere are assigned Branch pre-fixes like those created in SAMPro. &#160;</p>
<p>Corrects a problem in early 8.2 versions where Labor/Other entries didn't post the Revenue Rate.</p>
<p>The serialized inventory check now uses the Location from the TechAnywhere message.</p>
<p>This function now ignores the sys-ffv-global-settings registry's ResetComputedWorkOrdersWhenChanged = true option which interrupted the post in previous releases. &#160;</p>
<p>Flat Rate Posting now correctly posts the price set by technician.</p>
<p>This release corrects an issue with setting the Job Cost Category (via registry) for Inventory Items when posting a Quote from TechAnywhere.</p>
<p>This release disables the spurious "Applied Payment exceeds the Amount Owed" message. &#160;</p>
<p>Flat Rate lines are now posted correctly if the Technician changes the price to / from 0 dollar.</p>
<p>When a status change from TechAnywhere is posted, the system uses <span id="BugEvents61">the actual date/time of when the tech changed the status instead of the date/time of when the WO actually changed.</span></p>
<h3><span>17.8.1 Posting New Site Equipment</span></h3>
<p><span>P</span>reviously, new Site Equipment created from TechAnywhere would always set the Default Service information (Job ID, Cost Code, Bill Item) from the source Work Order. This is appropriate for Service Work Orders, but is typically not accurate when adding new Equipment on a PM where the Work Order contains references to a PM Job/Cost Code/Billing Item. Going forward, when new Site Equipment is created from TechAnywhere for PreventiveMaint work orders, the new Equipment's Default Service Job fields will be left blank. The Job information on these new Equipment records can be manually added by filtering for new equipment created by TechAnywhere (Equip. Status = NewFromTA).</p>
<p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">&#160;</p>
<h1>18 Service Channel</h1>
<p>This release modifies the computation of DATETIME so that it can not be earlier than SCHED_DATETIME to conform with recent ServiceChannel validations.</p>
<p style="margin-left: 8px;">Corrects an "IndexOf" error when selecting a weblog in New Call.</p>
<p style="margin-left: 8px;">This release corrects a 'key is missing' error when changing status for mutual client PM's. Also traps error caused by ill-formed ServiceChannel response messages.</p>
<p style="margin-left: 8px;">If the registry NewWOToServiceChannelEnabled is set to True, ServiceChannel creates PM's and sends them to SAMPro. If SAMPro's Start Create PM WorkOrders is also used, it creates duplicate PM's. Contact Support for a registry entry to resolve this condition.</p>
<p style="margin-left: 8px;">This release adds SCHED_DATETIME to outbound XML for new Work Orders as per new requirements from ServiceChannel.</p>
<p style="margin-left: 8px;">Allows WOUPDATES to post to Work Orders originating in Sampro. &#160;</p>
<p style="margin-left: 8px;">The type is now obtained from the callNode's attributes instead of a subNode.</p>
<p>The system now ignores the document if an FMMSInfo record does not already exist but the inbound dispatch can be identified as a WorkOrder Update dispatch.</p>
<p>This release corrects an amperand &amp; character issue causing invalid XML when parsing requests.</p>
<p>Corrects SQL error: Incorrect syntax near '.' when trying to create RN index on FMMSInfo table.</p>
<p style="margin-left: 8px;">Corrects an error processing Service Requests containing an '&amp;' character.</p>
<p>Invalid data provided for an IVR check in/out was generating 'Key is Missing' errors, stopping the Scheduled Event Manager. &#160;In this release, the bad check in/out data is ignored.</p>
<p>Corrects a runtime error "do" not understood when posting inbound data.</p>
<p>This release corrects a problem where labor charges were added into the other charges total of the ServiceChannel invoice CSV file.</p>
<p>If a CHECK IN XML packet omits the SCHED_DATETIME field, the system now skips setting the Date and Time Scheduled on the Work Order's Technicians tab instead of erring out.</p>
<p>This release creates the fmmsinfo and fmmsmppng tables with the required unique indexes.</p>
<p>When the New Call user selects an incoming Service Channel Dispatch, a dialog box appears. A new button, 'Assign To WO' has been added: when clicked, a dialog requesting the entry of an existing Work Order Id appears. Once a valid Work Order has been entered, the new Dispatch will be attached to that Work Order.</p>
<h2>18.1 Registry Entries</h2>
<h3>18.1.1 &#160;Additional Breakout of Charges for Service Channel</h3>
<p>SAMPro now supports the following charges to be broken out on the Service Channel Invoice Spreadsheet: Trip Charge, Material Total, Freight Charge, Markup. Previously, the Trip Charge and the Freight Charge were included in the Material Total. In addition, a separate Markup charge was not reported on the Invoice.</p>
<p>There are separate columns on the spreadsheet for Trip Charge, Material Total, and Freight Charge. The Markup amount is to be reported in the Other Charges columns.</p>
<p>Charges from the Work Order’s Other tab that are not identified as a Freight Charge or a Trip Charge will be included in the ‘Other Charges’ column.</p>
<p style="margin-left: 36.00pt;">If there is exactly one ‘Other Charge’, the Other Rate’s Description will appear in the ‘Other Charges Description’ column.</p>
<p style="margin-left: 36.00pt;">If there is more than one ‘Other Charge’, the word ‘Various’ will appear in the ‘Other Charges Description’ column.</p>
<p>SAMPro registry entries will be required to implement these enhancements. The SAMPro Registry entry for ‘sys-fmms-vendor-servicechannel’ will be used to identify:</p>
<h3>18.1.1a Other Rate Id’s that Identify Freight Charges</h3>
<p><font style="font-weight: bold;">Setting Key:</font> OtherCodesFreight</p>
<p><font style="font-weight: bold;">Setting Value:</font> A comma separated list of Other Rate Ids identifying Freight Charges.</p>
<h3>18.1.1b Other Rate Id’s that Identify Trip Charges</h3>
<p><font style="font-weight: bold;">Setting Key:</font> OtherCodesTravel</p>
<p><font style="font-weight: bold;">Setting Value:</font> A comma separated list of Other Rate Ids identifying trip charges.</p>
<h3><span id="BugEvents171">18.1.2 Required Registry Entry for Invoicing</span></h3>
<p>This release supports Service Channel's Invoice Template 12.</p>
<p style="font-weight: bold;"><span id="BugEvents161">A change in the sys-fmms-vendor-ServiceChannel registry is required to support this upgrade:</span></p>
<p style="margin-left: 48px;"><span>The Setting Key: InvoicePwd setting is no longer used and should be disabled or deleted.</span></p>
<p style="font-weight: bold;">New Required Setting:</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: bold;">Setting Key:</span> <span>InvoicePIN &#160;Setting Value:</span> <span style="font-style: italic;"><i>IVRPINNumber</i></span></p>
<p><span>The value of this setting should the IVR PIN Number used by your company.</span></p>
<h3>18.1.3 Use ServiceChannel IVR Service for Work Orders Originating in SAMPro</h3>
<p>This enhancement extends SAMPro’s ServiceChannel Data Bridge to provide for the use of the ServiceChannel IVR service for Work Orders not originating as &#160;ServiceChannel New Service Requests. &#160;A registry (see below) is required to enable this functionality.</p>
<p>When a Work Order is created in SAM Pro via New Call, Create PM Work Order, Create PM Billing, or Create Rental Billing, a <span style="text-indent: -.25in; mso-list: l0 level1 lfo1;">New Work Order XML message (as per ServiceChannel specs) for transmission to ServiceChannel. In the New Call case, however, this process will be omitted if the Work Order was created as the result of the pulling of a ServiceChannel New Service Request from SAMPro’s weblog.</span></p>
<p><span style="text-indent: -.25in; mso-list: l0 level1 lfo1;">The queueing of the New Work Order XML will take place regardless of whether the Client is or is not a “Mutual” Authority/ServiceChannel client. The contents of the New Work Order XML message will be derived from the contents of the SAMPro Work Order and the appropriate entries in the following Registry.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: bold;">Registry Id:</span> sys-FMMS-Vendor-ServiceChannel</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: bold;">Setting Key:</span> NewWOToServiceChannelEnabled &#160;<span style="font-weight: bold;">Setting Value:</span> True</p>
<p><span style="text-indent: -.25in; mso-list: l1 level1 lfo2;">This registry option is required to enable this feature. Set its value to ‘Yes’ or ‘True’ to turn this feature on. Actually, any value beginning with ‘Y’, ‘y’, ‘T’, or ‘t’ will enable this feature.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: bold;">Setting Key:</span> NewWOToServiceChannelDefaults</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: bold;">Setting Value:</span> LOC:multi, SUB:#fromSC, PRIORITY:NORMAL, PRICE:0.00, NTE:0.00, STATUS:OPEN, CURRENCY:USD, TRADE:HVAC, OPERATOR:namefromSC, CATEGORY:Repair</p>
<p><span style="text-indent: -.25in; mso-list: l1 level1 lfo2;">This registry sets the default values of certain attributes for the generated New Work Order. Note that these all appear on one registry line. The format of the line is a collection of comma separated key/Value pairs with the keys separated from the values by a colon.</span></p>
<p><span style="text-indent: -.25in; mso-list: l1 level1 lfo2; mso-bidi-font-family: 'Courier New';"><u>Check with ServiceChannel</u> for the correct values for the <b style="mso-bidi-font-weight: normal;">LOC</b>, <b style="mso-bidi-font-weight: normal;">SUB</b>, <b style="mso-bidi-font-weight: normal;">TRADE</b>, <b style="mso-bidi-font-weight: normal;">OPERATOR</b>, and <b style="mso-bidi-font-weight: normal;">CATEGORY</b> keys as these may vary from installation to installation.</span></p>
<h2>18.2 Specialized CVS Formatting</h2>
<p style="font-weight: bold;">Identifying CVS Clients</p>
<p>A SAMPro user could potentially have Service Channel arrangements for a mixture of CVS and Generic clients. It is assumed that such a user would also produce a uniquely formatted paper invoice format for CVS. Within SAMPro, the appropriate invoice format is identified by the Report Query Id found in the appropriate Job Billing Item record.</p>
<h3>Registry to Identify Clients Requiring Special CVS Spreadsheets</h3>
<p><font style="font-weight: bold;">Setting Key:</font> ReportQueriesForMarkupMode</p>
<p><font style="font-weight: bold;">Setting Value:</font> A comma separated list of Report Query Ids</p>
<p>These Report Query Ids will identify clients (via their Billing Items) requiring special CVS formatted Service Channel invoice spreadsheet lines.</p>
<p style="font-weight: bold;">For CVS type clients</p>
<p>Charges will appear in the ‘Freight Charges’ and ‘Trip Charge’ columns as determined by the same mechanism used by the ‘Generic’ type clients.</p>
<p>Charges that would (for ‘Generic type Clients) be included in the ‘Other Charges’ column will now appear in the ‘Material Total’ column. This will free up the ‘Other Charges’ column to be used for Markup.</p>
<p>Charges appearing in the ‘Material Total’ column will have to be classified as either being ‘Marked Up’ or as ‘Flat Rate’. This will be done by examining the charge’s ‘Billing Rate Type’. Charges from the Work Other’s ‘Other’ Tab will be considered as ‘Marked Up’ if and only if the Billing Rate Type is set to one of the ‘markup’ types of markup, margin or multiplier. Charges from the Work Order’s ‘Inventory’ Tab will always be considered as ‘Marked Up’.</p>
<p>If a charge is considered as ‘Marked Up’, the ‘Markup Amount’ will be included in the ‘Other Charges’ column but not in the ‘Material Total’ column.</p>
<p>If it is determined that the ‘Other Charges’ column will be non-zero, the ‘Other Charges Description’ column will be set to ‘Markup’. Otherwise it will be left blank.</p>
<h2>18.3 Other Charges Description</h2>
<p>In SAMPro invoices, the description of the ‘other’ charges comes from the Other Rate Description. However, Service Channel now only allows the following valid Other Charge Descriptions:</p>
<p>Discount<br />
Management Fee<br />
Markup<br />
Overhead &amp; Profit<br />
Rental Fee<br />
Shipping &amp; Handling<br />
Subcontractor Cost<br />
<br />
To ensure that the Service Channel invoice conforms to this standard, the following registry should be implemented to statically set the description:</p>
<p>Id: sys-fmms-servicechannel</p>
<p>Setting Key: OtherChargesDescription&#160;Setting Value: <font style="font-style: italic;">valid description</font><br />
<br />
If this entry is not found the description 'Not Found In SAMPro Registry' will be used. Anytime a Service Channel invoice is generated and contains a dollar amount in the Other Charges Total section, it will need to use what is specified in the registry.</p>
<h3>18.3.1 Other Charge Description Sent to Service Channel</h3>
<p>In SAM Pro invoices, the description of the ‘other’ charges comes from the Other Rate Description. However, Service Channel now only allows the following valid Other Charge Descriptions:</p>
<p style="margin-left: 36.00pt;">Discount<br />
Management Fee<br />
Markup<br />
Overhead &amp; Profit<br />
Rental Fee<br />
Shipping &amp; Handling<br />
Subcontractor Cost<br />
<br />
To ensure that the Service Channel invoice conforms to this standard, the following registry should be implemented to statically set the description:</p>
<p><font style="font-weight: bold;">Setting Key:</font> OtherChargesDescription&#160;<font style="font-weight: bold;">Setting Value:</font> valid description<br />
<br />
If this entry is not found the description 'Not Found In SAMPro Registry' will be used. Anytime a Service Channel invoice is generated and contains a dollar amount in the Other Charges Total section, it will need to use what is specified in the registry.</p>
<h3>18.3.2 Registry Entries to Define Labor and Tax Subcontracting Charges</h3>
<p>This enhancement to Service Channel integration allows users to break out their Labor (Other Rate) subcontracting charges into the 'Labor Total' section of the Service Channel invoice format as well as for the tax that they pass on to the customer as an Other Rate to display in the 'Invoice Tax' section of the Service Channel invoice format.</p>
<p><font style="font-weight: bold;">Registry Id:</font> sys-fmms-vendor-servicechannel</p>
<p><font style="font-weight: bold;">Setting Key:</font> OtherCodesLabor <font style="font-weight: bold;">Setting Value:</font> list of other rates for labor</p>
<p><font style="font-weight: bold;">Setting Key:</font> OtherCodesTax <font style="font-weight: bold;">Setting Value:</font> list of other rates for tax</p>
<p>This release supports multiple lines for the same group of Other Codes (e.g. OtherCodesLabor). This is in case there are too many codes (e.g. OtherCodesLabor codes) to fit on a single line in the registry entry.</p>
<h2>18.4 Do Not Send Public Notes to ServiceChannel</h2>
<p>The following registry may be used to disable sending public notes to ServiceChannel; it would typically be enabled to prevent TechAnywhere created notes from being sent. Since there is not a way to determine if the note came from TechAnywhere or not, the only suitable solution is to create a registry setting that will disable this FMMS functionality.</p>
<p><font style="font-weight: bold;">Registry Id:</font> sys-fmms-vendor-servicechannel</p>
<p style="margin-left: 36.00pt;">(Or sys-fmms-vendorservicechannel--agenttech which will disable this function only for the TechAnywhere event manager)</p>
<p><font style="font-weight: bold;">Setting Key:</font> UploadNotes &#160;<font style="font-weight: bold;">Setting Value:</font> N</p>
<p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">&#160;</p>
<h1>19 TimeAnywhere</h1>
<h2>19.1 Registry Entries</h2>
<h2>19.2 Reports</h2>
<h2>19.3 TimeAnywhere Post</h2>
<p><span style="font-weight: bold;">Important: O</span><span id="BugEvents261">nly PR Periods flagged as 'Remote Technician Applet OK to Use' may now be used with TimeAnywhere.</span></p>
<p>This release ensures that the system correctly sets them Payroll Period when Labor Journal entries are generated.</p>
<p>Corrects a problem where the TimeAnywhere Post failed if the checks for the default PR Period had already been printed. &#160;</p>
<p>In this release, the Description field in Labor Journal entries posted from TimeAnywhere is now blank. This change was made to prevent the description “TimeAnywhere Entry” from appearing in Construction Invoices for time recorded in TimeAnywhere.</p>
<p>If any part of a TimeAnywhere message fails posting, all entries are rolled back.</p>
<p>&#160;The Job Cost Category from TimeAnywhere is now used to when posting the Labor Journal; previously, the default Cost Category from the Labor Rate was always used. &#160;</p>
<h1>20 Fleetmatics (SageQuest)</h1>
<h3>20.0.1 Recent Updates</h3>
<p>The estimated hours is now converted to seconds when a message is sent to Fleetmatics as a result of a drag and drop operation on the Classic Board. In addition, the system no longer sends messages to Fleetmatics if the old and new Techs are the same during a drag and drop.</p>
<p>This release corrects a problem where the Estimated Hours sent to Fleetmatics/SageQuest was being truncated after 9,999 seconds (2hr 47min).</p>
<p>Corrects a very sporadic problem with incorrect responses when clicking the Work Order's Time+Distance button.</p>
<p>GeoCode search will now send along the city and state portions of the address to assist in the latitude/longitude search.</p>
<p>Timeout increased from 30 seconds to 60 seconds. At times Fleetmatics / SageQuest is overloaded and it takes more than 30 seconds to respond with the answer. Sampro was giving up looking for the response just when Fleetmatics / SageQuest overcomes its troubles and give a response. The Fleetmatics / SageQuest integration software gives up at 60 seconds, which is what Sampro was increased to match. Downside is, if there is an actual problem, like the Fleetmatics / SageQuest service is not running, it will now take 60 seconds to respond rather than 30.</p>
<p>TimeOut alarm improved to reference "Fleetmatics" instead of just "SageQuest" and helpful guidance as to how to remedy the problem (make sure service is running).</p>
<h2>20.1 Registries</h2>
<h3>20.1.1 Send work order updates to SageQuest regardless of the Schedule Date</h3>
<p><font style="font-weight: bold;">Registry Id:</font> sys-ffv-global-settings</p>
<p><font style="font-weight: bold;">Setting Key:</font> AllowSageQuestToUsePriorDates <font style="font-weight: bold;">Setting Value:</font> true (default is false)<br />
If this registry setting is set to true, SAMPro will send work order updates to SageQuest regardless of the schedule date. This option should be set for clients who do not wish to roll the dispatch board over to keep the schedule date current just to have their work orders show up and update the SageQuest map.</p>
<h2>20.3 Start Work Order Daily Edit</h2>
<p>This release fixes the scheduled date/time and estimated hours format so that SageQuest is correctly updated by this function.</p>
<h2>20.4 Get Geocodes</h2>
<p>The function ‘Get GeoCodes for Client Sites’ now excludes Client Site Templates.</p>
<h1>21 DBAnalytics</h1>
<p>This release corrects the recently introduced issue with not being able to open SAMPro viewers from the DBAnalytics dashboard when DBAnalytics is launched from within SAMPro.</p>
<h2>21.1 Registries</h2>
<h3>21.1.1 Enable Master Contract Future Inspections Table</h3>
<p>The internal table (mstrclntsteeqpmntpm) has been added to simplify reporting/KPI's for future PM inspections as defined in Master Contracts.&#160;This table is automatically created during data conversion if the following registry is enabled. &#160;The contents of the new table are affected by: saving Master Contract records, saving Site Equipment records, generating PM Work Orders, running Start Renew Service Contract, running Start Renew Master Contract and running Create New PM Work Schedule from Old. &#160;The system will confirm that the following registry is in effected before updating the Master Contract Future Inspections table. &#160;</p>
<p style="margin-left: 48px;"><span style="font-weight: bold;">Id:</span> sys-ffv-global-settings<br />
<span style="font-weight: bold;">Setting Key:</span> CreateMasterSiteEquipmentPMTable &#160;&#160;<span style="font-weight: bold;">Setting Value:</span> true</p>
<p style="margin-left: 48px;"><span style="font-weight: bold;">Important:</span> if this registry entry is enabled, the following registry entry (DisableMCFutureInspectionsTable) must be absent or disabled. &#160;</p>
<h3>21.1.1a Disable Master Contract Future Inspection Table</h3>
<p>The following registry disables the Master Contract future inspections table. Implement ONLY if DBAnalytics or other reports that depend on the table are not used.</p>
<p style="font-weight: bold;">Id: <span style="font-weight: normal;">sys-ffv-global-settings</span></p>
<p style="font-weight: bold;">Setting Key: <span style="font-weight: normal;">DisableMCFutureInspectionsTable</span> <span style="font-weight: normal;">&#160;&#160;&#160;</span>Setting Value: <span style="font-weight: normal;">true</span></p>
<p>Use if Master Contract DBAnalytics are NOT required.</p>
<h2>21.2 KPI’s</h2>
<h2>21.3 Start GL History Summary Rebuild&#160;</h2>
<p>Equity accounts are now properly summarized within the equity-type sub-categories.</p>
<h2>21.4 Master Contract Future PM’s</h2>
<p style="margin-left: 8px;">The mstrcntrcteqpmntpm table contains data for 'future' Master Contract inspections for KPI's. This release corrects updates to the table generated when Equipment and the Master Contract Records are changed.</p>
<p style="margin-left: 8px;">A registry entry is required to enable the use of this table; see Customer Note 21.1.1 for details</p>
<h2>21.5 New Function: Start Rebuild Master Contract Future Inspections</h2>
<p>This new starter function has no input options. &#160;It does a complete rebuild of the mstrclntsteeqpmntpm table. It is recommended that it be run after hours. This function should be run if you need the new table for your KPI's. The registry specified in Customer Note 21. should be enabled before running this function.</p>
<h1>22 XCharge &#160;- OpenEdge Credit Card Billing</h1>
<h3>22.0.1 Recent Updates</h3>
<p>When a payment is processed via Create PM Billings, SAMPro now includes User, Client, Client Site, Work Order and Job Id are now included in the message sent to XCharge/ OpenEdge.</p>
<p style="margin-left: 8px;">Added support for Canadian users. Requires a new customization file for current 8.2 Canadian installations wishing to use this feature.</p>
<p style="margin-left: 8px;">Corrects problem with Use Tax being charged to customer's credit card.</p>
<p>PM Billing with a Payment Alias now only adds sales tax if applicable for the selected job.<br />
<br />
If a Payment Alias is removed from the Site Parent, it will not be used when a PM Work Order generated.</p>
<p>Corrects a SQL 156 error which occurred when processing 'credit' PMs.</p>
<p style="font-weight: bold;">Work Order COD Tab / Service Invoice</p>
<p>When a payment is processed via the Work Order's COD Tab, SAMPro now includes Client, Client Site, Work Order and Job Id are now included in the message sent to XCharge.</p>
<h5>22.0.1a &#160;Changes in 8.2545.077</h5>
<p>In this release, the Create New Billing Schedule and Renew Service Contract functions clear payment processing fields (alias, approval and decline codes) when creating Client Site Billing schedule records.</p>
<p>Validation now prevents assigning a Payment Alias if the Site Id is blank.</p>
<p>When a payment is declined (during the generation of the Cash Receipt Journal), the system will display a message and adds a Note to WorkOrder.</p>
<h3>22.0.2 Revised Report Service Invoice</h3>
<p>The revised Report Service Invoice (SERVICEINVOICEv80b017) dated 4/14/2014 corrects the display of the 'Amount Due this Invoice' total in cases where an APT credit had been processed.</p>
<h2>22.1 Overview</h2>
<p>SAMPro's integration with OpenEdge provides for a secure portal to open from SAMPro for submitting credit card transactions for authorization and settlement with no need for a physical credit card terminal. TechAnywhere already provides this functionality via credit card swipe.</p>
<p><span id="BugEvents4">Instead of swiping a credit card, SAMPro users can now click a button to automatically launch their default internet browser pointing to OpenEdge's</span> XWeb Hosted Payment Form portal. &#160;This portal may be used to capture and save an Alias to be used later by SAMPro for recurring PM Billing (via the Payment Alias button in the Client Site or Master Contract record) or to record a single payment (with the Process Payment button in the AR Cash Receipts and Work Order COD tab). &#160;</p>
<p>The customer's credit card information will be stored securely by OpenEdge. For recurring payments for PM's, a Payment Alias will be recorded in SAMPro in the Client Site and/or Master Contract. &#160;&#160;</p>
<h3>22.1.1 Set Up</h3>
<p><span>1. To enable this functionality in SAMPro, you must first set up a MOTO (Mail Order/Telephone Order) account with OpenEdge.</span></p>
<p><span>2. &#160;SamproSecureCommunication.war must be installed in Glassfish to enable this functionality. If your firm does not already have a Glassfish server installed (for DBAnalytics or TechAnywhere) contact your support representative to set this up.</span></p>
<p><span>3. Complete the registry entries listed below.</span></p>
<p><span>4. I</span>t is recommended that you create a new Payment Type record with the Id set to OpenEdge and the GL Bank Account set to the appropriate bank or sweep account for OpenEdge Payments. This will be used for recurring payment processing for preventative maintenance.</p>
<p><span>5. We recommend testing this functionality with a company credit card before using for customers.</span></p>

<h2>22.3 AR Cash Receipts Payment Processing</h2>
<p>If you have established an account with OpenEdge, you may now process a credit card payment in the AR Cash Receipts Journal.</p>
<p>1. If you use a different sweep account for OpenEdge payments, change the Bank Account on the GL tab.</p>
<p>2. On the Main tab, select Invoice or Invoices that the customer wishes to pay for.</p>
<p>3. Enter the Discount (if any) and Total Receipt; this is the amount that will be processed on the credit card.</p>
<p><img src="Process_Payment.bmp" alt="" style="border: none;" border="0" /></p>
<p>4. Verify that the customer has their credit card ready, and then click the Process Payment button.</p>
<p>5. SAM Pro will display a message reminding you that you will only have 60 seconds to enter the information; click Yes to continue. &#160;Another message inform you that the journal entry will be added before Payment Processing; click Yes again. &#160;</p>
<p>6. When the x-web portal opens, enter the customer's credit card number (without spaces or dashes) and expiration date and click Submit.</p>
<p>7. If the card is approved, the web portal will display "Approval" in red. If it is not approved, check the number and expiration date and try submitting it again.</p>

<h2>23 FMAnywhere</h2>
<h3>23.0 Overview</h3>
<p>FMAnywhere is a browser-based utility that allows your customers to log on to review their service requests and invoices, enter a new service request, or accept a quote. If you are running SQL Server, reports defined in Report Services may also be provided to your clients to run in real time. &#160;Since all firms – and their customers – have different needs, FMAnywhere allows your firm to create a unique web portal.</p>
<p>Like DBAnalytics and TechAnywhere, FMAnywhere requires the installation of the Glassfish server. Typically, this would be handled by your support representative. &#160;</p>
<p>If you are currently using the older version of the web client interface, your Web User and Web Profile records will generally also work for the new FMAnywhere. Instructions specific to FMAnywhere are provided as PowerPoint documents. &#160;These are available to registered users via the SAMPro users forum (a current support contract is required for access) or from your support representative. &#160;</p>
<p>When a Quote Scope is accepted or declined, an email is now sent to the Contact Email of the Sales Rep associated with the Quote. If the Sale's Rep's Contact Email is not available, the email will be sent to the emailto address in the sys-fmanywhere registry. The Quote Id, Option Code, Scope Change By (Web User), and new Scope Status will be included in the message. &#160;</p>
<h3>23.1 Registry</h3>
<p>FMAnywhere requires a number of registry options to run properly. Depending upon how you wish to configure your FMAnywhere website, all entries will be made in the sys-fmanywhere registry entry, but may be overridden for a particular web user (or the web users associated with a particular web profile) if needed.</p>
<p>Note: the following registry entries use the Setting Key/Setting Value used in the Registry viewer. Override registries entered on the Registry tab of the Web User record will use a single field version with an equal sign separating the key and value: e.g, email-to=valid email address.</p>

<h5 style="margin-left: 48px;">Java 8-11: TLS 1.0</h5>

Validation now requires a Vendor Id on Sub lines when its option is approved.</p>
<p style="margin-left: 48px;"><span style="font-weight: bold;">Approval Wizard:</span> &#160;If the user elects to create a New WO, the ApprovalWizardDefaultTechStatus option is only used to set the Tech Status on lines for the NEW WO: the current Tech Statuses for the source WO will not be changed.</p>

<p style="margin-left: 48px;"><span style="font-weight: bold;">WO Invoice Ready:</span> In V8.1, we added 'Wait Paperwork' to the statuses that are changed to Invoice Ready when the Invoice Ready box is flagged.
