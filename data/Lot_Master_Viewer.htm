<h1>Lot Master (Inventory Item by Test) Viewer</h1>
<h2>Purpose:</h2>
<p>Used to enter test results for serialized and lot controlled items that 
 are flagged for Quality Control (QC) in the Inventory Item record. The 
 Lot Status is also set from this viewer.</p>
<h2>Usage:</h2>
<p>A Lot Master record is created by the system whenever a serialized or 
 lot controlled inventory with a new serial/lot control number is received 
 in the PO Receipts Journal or created via the Inventory Management Journal.</p>
<p>When a Quality Controlled lot or serialized item is received, it is 
 not immediately listed as On Hand in inventory, but instead is listed 
 as In Test. Items that are In Test may not be allocated to client or shop 
 orders. The Lot Master enables you to log the Quality Control results, 
 and then mark the Lot (or Serialized Item) as Accepted, Special or Reject.</p>
<h2>Important Fields: Upper Section</h2>
<p><font style="font-weight: bold;">Note:</font> this Help Topic lists 
 the standard configuration of all fields that may be included in this 
 record. If you are using a customized system, the fields displayed on 
 your screen may not exactly match the order or status (required, optional, 
 default, display-only, hidden, etc.) of the fields described in this Topic.</p>
<p>This viewer is divided into two sections. The upper section lists information 
 concerning the serialized or lot controlled item. The Test tab of the 
 lower section is used to enter test results for items that are marked 
 as Quality Control (QC). Note that when a QC item is received, its status 
 is set to Untested, and it will be listed as In Testing at its receiving 
 location. The Locations tab displays the contents of this Lot by Location.</p>
<p style="font-weight: bold;">Inventory Item Id: Inventory Item Name: <br/>
<span style="font-weight: normal;">The Inventory Item associated with this 
 serialized or lot-controlled item. It is set when a serialized / lot controlled 
 item is purchased and received or &#39;created&#39; in the Inventory Adjustments 
 Journal.</span> </p>
<p style="font-weight: bold;">Serial/Lot Id:  Location Id:<br/>
Vendor Serial Lot#:  <br/>
<span style="font-weight: normal;">The fields are set by the system when 
 a serialized / lot controlled item is received in the Inventory Receipts 
 Journal or  &#39;created&#39; in the Inventory Adjustments Journal (serialized 
 items only).</span> </p>
<p style="font-weight: bold; margin-left: 48px;">Warning: <span style="font-weight: normal;">It 
 is not advised to manually edit the Serial/Lot ID in the Serial/Lot Master. 
 Doing so could create discrepancies between the Serial/Lot Master record 
 and the other referenced tables.</span></p>
<p><font style="font-weight: bold;">Qty On Hand:<br/>
Qty In Test:<br/>
Qty Rejected:<br/>
</font> These display-only fields are maintained by the system.</p>

<span style="font-weight: normal;">This field is set when the item is purchased 
 from a Vendor and received.</span></p>
<p><font style="font-weight: bold;">Lot Status</font><br/>
By default, items that are not Quality Controlled are assigned the Status 
 of Accepted when they are received in the PO/Inventory Receipts journal: 
 these items will appear as On Hand in their receiving Location.</p>
<p>Quality Controlled items are assigned the status of Untested when they 
 are received in the PO/Inventory Receipts journal: these items will appear 
 as In Testing in their receiving Location. Changing the Lot Status (by 
 double-clicking on the circular radio button next to the desired type 
 (keyboard users should Tab to the desired button and then press the Spacebar 
 to select it) will have the following results when the Lot Master record 
 is saved:</p>
<p style="margin-left: 36.00pt;"><font style="font-weight: bold;">Accepted</font> 
 moves the items to On Hand at their location.</p>
<p style="margin-left: 36.00pt;"><font style="font-weight: bold;">Special</font> 
 moves the items to On Hand at their location. Lots may be marked as Special 
 if they are usable (for some applications) but not entirely up to specification.</p>
<p style="margin-left: 36.00pt;"><font style="font-weight: bold;">Rejected</font> 
 moves the items to Rejected: these items should not be used.</p>
