<h1>Security Viewer</h1>
<h2>Purpose:</h2>
<p>This record is used to implement multiple location security for multiple 
 branches or regions running on a single database. In this discussion, 
 we will define the term <font style="font-style: italic;">read access</font> 
 as the ability to &quot;see&quot; a record or id, and <font style="font-style: italic;">write 
 access</font> as the ability to change the contents of, add or delete 
 a record. Security limits read access so that you can create local records 
 (such as client sites) that are only applicable to a single branch office 
 - or a specific area or region. Global records (such as parts records 
 that are standard company-wide) visible to all locations and users are 
 created without security limits. In this way, offices A and B can share 
 the same database without seeing each other&#39;s information.</p>
<p>For Intercompany installations, the Security is also specified in the 
 Company record to control the Security applied to transactions for a Company. 
 </p>
<p>By coordinating your Security, User, User Group and Branch records, 
 you can control the read and write access of the user groups within your 
 system. Security controls read access to individual records within a viewer 
 (e.g., some client site records), based on the security level of the user. 
 User Groups can be set up to limit write access to an entire class of 
 records viewer. For example, you could set up your user groups so that 
 only global users had access to Inventory Item records. In this way, your 
 parts inventory list would remain consistent for all branch users. Global 
 User Groups would likewise be restricted from creating Client Site records 
 since these records should only be created by branches.</p>
<p style="margin-left: 36.00pt;"><font style="font-weight: bold;">Security 
 by Job<br/>
</font>See <a href="Registry_Entry_Global_Settings__Column_Compression__Dispatch_Board_Rows__History_Log_Inventory_Markup.htm#Global_Settings_Security_Override">Global 
 Setting Security Override</a> to set the security of work orders and other 
 records according the security of the Job, not the user.</p>
<h2>Usage:</h2>
<p>Required to implement security and multiple branches in a centralized 
 database. Note that a detailed Security setup example is included at the 
 end of this topic. <font style="font-weight: bold;">Records created by 
 a user without a Security Id are considered to be global, and may be viewed 
 by all users.</font></p>
<h2>Registry:</h2>
<p>See <a href="Registry_Entry_Global_Settings__Column_Compression__Dispatch_Board_Rows__History_Log_Inventory_Markup.htm#Global_Settings_Security_Override">Global 
 Setting Security Override</a> to set the security of work orders and other 
 records according the security of the Job, not the user.</p>
<p style="margin-left: 8px;">See <a href="Registry_Security_Overrides.htm">Block 
 Users from Seeing Records with Specific Security</a> for a registry to 
 limit user&#39;s access to specific companies by Security (Intercompany installations).</p>
<h2>Important Fields:</h2>
<p><font style="font-weight: bold;">Security Id:</font><br/>
This required alpha-numeric field identifies this security level (A, A1, 
 0, 01, etc.) and determines the security level that will be associated 
 with a record created by this user.</p>
<p style="margin-left: 48px;"><span style="font-weight: bold;">Important 
 Note:</span> Due to SAMPro&#39;s registry hierarchy, a Branch Id should NEVER 
 be the same as any Security Id. Doing so may result in undesirable results 
 with a variety of registry settings. </p>
<p><font style="font-weight: bold;">Description:</font><br/>
A brief description of the group (Region 1, Rgn 1 Branch 1, etc). This 
 field is optional.</p>
<p><font style="font-weight: bold;">Read Only?</font> Check this field 
 (by double-clicking or pressing the spacebar) if users with this security 
 level should be able to view (read only) information but not change or 
 create it. Typically, this field would be checked to enable a user to 
 run regional reports.</p>
<p><font style="font-weight: bold;">Like:</font><br/>
This field defines how much information users with this security level 
 can ‘see’. The last (right-hand) character must be the % (percent sign). 
 The alpha-numeric characters to the left of the percent sign form an alpha-numeric 
 template, ranging from the most general (highest security level) to the 
 most specific (lowest level). This system can include as many tiers as 
 needed but must be used consistently. The following example shows a four-tiered 
 system:</p>
<p style="margin-left: 36.00pt;"><font style="font-weight: bold;">%</font> 
 (sees local records created at all security levels (A, B, A1, etc.).<br/>
<font style="font-weight: bold;">A%</font> (sees records created at and 
 below security level A (A1, A2, etc.), but not B.<br/>
<font style="font-weight: bold;">A1%</font> (sees local records created 
 at and below security level A1 (A11, A12, etc.).<br/>
<font style="font-weight: bold;">A11%</font> (sees local records created 
 at level A11 only)</p>
<p>Recall that all users can see records created at the global level by 
 a user with no security implemented in his user record.</p>
<h3>Extended Example: Branches do not Share Information</h3>
<p style="margin-left: 36.00pt;">The following illustration shows how Security 
 records could be set up for a firm using a centralized database with two 
 regions (01 and 02), each of which include two branches (0101 and 0102 
 for Region 1, and 0201 and 0202 for Region 2). All branches should be 
 able to &quot;see&quot; all global inventory item records, but only those 
 local client sites pertaining to their individual branch. In addition, 
 we want to be able to run consolidated reports for regions 1 and 2 on 
 a read-only basis. The following illustration shows how the Security Records 
 would be set up to implement this three-tiered scheme (global, region 
 and branch).</p>
<p style="margin-left: 36.00pt;"><img src="assets/images/image/emi_0078.gif" alt="image\emi_0078.gif" title="image\emi_0078.gif" width="980" height="550" border="0"/></p>
<p style="margin-left: 36.00pt;">After creating Security records, User 
 Groups should be set up to restrict write access to those record appropriate 
 to the security level of Global or Branch. In this example, the User Group 
 Local would include locally defined records such as Client Site, Client 
 Site Equipment, Work Orders, Technicians, Employees, and Service Zone. 
 The User Group Global would include standard company records required 
 to be identical for all branches, including Inventory Groups and Items, 
 Work Codes, and Certifications.</p>
<p style="margin-left: 36.00pt;">User(s) must also be set up as shown below. 
  </p>
<p style="margin-left: 36.00pt;"><img src="assets/images/image/emi_0079.gif" alt="image\emi_0079.gif" title="image\emi_0079.gif" width="980" height="626" border="0"/></p>
<p style="margin-left: 36.00pt;">When this system is in place, global users 
 will have write access to all global records. Users with a Security Id 
 of 0101 (region 1, branch one) will be able to view global records, and 
 records created with a Security level of 0101 - but not records created 
 under local security levels 0102, 0201, or 0202. Only global users can 
 create global records (e.g., inventory items). Branch users should only 
 create those local records that pertain to their sites (e.g., Client Sites).</p>
<p><font style="font-weight: bold; font-style: italic;" color="#FF0000">TIP</font> 
 <font style="font-style: italic;" color="#FF0000"><br/>
</font>Remember that the Security Id field must be set in all limited security 
 (non-global) User records for correct implementation of this feature.</p>
