<h1>Report PR W2s Standard</h1>
<h2>Purpose:</h2>
<p>This function is used to print W2 Forms. W3 forms may be printed separately 
 via <a href="Report_PR_W3_Standard.htm">Report PR W3 (Standard)</a> or, 
 optionally, directly after Copy A of the W2. Note that this report does 
 not require native PCL printing.</p>
<h2>Usage:</h2>
<p>Successful W2 reporting depends on properly formatted registry entries 
 and tax-related records.  Click <a href="W2_Records_and_Setup.htm">W2 
 Records and Setup</a> to review your records as discussed before running 
 your W2&#39;s.</p>
<h2>Registry Entries:</h2>
<p>Make any adjustments needed to the horizontal or vertical positions 
 via the <a href="Registry_W2_Entry.htm">sys-printer-W2</a> and/or <a href="Registry_W3_Printing.htm">sys-printer-W3</a> 
 registries and check for alignment as needed.</p>
<p><a href="Registry_Entry_W2_and_W3_Printing.htm">Registry W2 Printing 
 (sys-report-rw2)</a> . This registry also supports the additional fields 
 required for W3 printing.</p>
<p>The <a href="Registry_Entry_Federal_EIN.htm">Registry Entry Federal 
 and State EIN</a> and <a href="Registry_Company_Name_Entry.htm">Registry 
 Company Name Entry</a> must be also be set correctly for all versions 
 preceding 9.1.611.043. </p>
<p>In <span style="font-weight: bold;">Version 9.1.611.043 and Above</span>, 
 if Intercompany processing is enabled then the following the Employer 
 Info will now come from the appropriate Company records, NOT the registries: 
 Company Name, Company Address and Company Federal EIN.</p>
<h2>Printing Notes:</h2>
<p><b style="mso-bidi-font-weight: normal;">Unless your support representative 
 updated your Folders view or made the appropriate Function Substitution, 
 you will need to run the new report from the Report Menu.</b><span style="mso-spacerun: yes;"> </span> Run 
 Report PR W-2 (Standard) and print a test alignment of your tax forms 
 for one or two employees before running all copies. You will be prompted 
 to run the Report PR W-3 (Standard) (although Report PR W-3s (Std) may 
 be also be run stand-alone).</p>
<p>W2&#39;s are printed in 1-part laser format. The 2 forms per page formats 
 are recommended. You will perform several print runs to produce your W2&#39;s 
 for the federal, state and local governments, your own records, and for 
 your employees. You must remember to change your forms as needed between 
 runs so that you do not waste forms.</p>
<p style="margin-left: 36.00pt;"><font style="font-weight: bold;">TIP: 
 Aligning your Forms:</font> we suggest printing a W2 for two employees 
 (by entering their  Id&#39;s in the Employee range) to check alignment. 
 DO NOT use the Plain Paper copy option. Make any adjustments needed to 
 the horizontal or vertical positions via the <a href="Registry_W2_Entry.htm">sys-printer-W2</a> 
 and/or sys-printer-W3 registries.</p>
<p style="margin-left: 8px;"><font style="font-weight: bold;">W3 Support</font><br/>
The Copy A option of Report PR W-2s (Standard) allows the printing of a 
 W3 form at the end of the report. The system will print the Copy A’s and 
 summary page as usual, and then pause. The following message box will 
 appear:</p>
<p style="margin-left: 88px;"> Print W3 Form? Insert W3 Form Now.</p>
<p style="margin-left: 8px;">If you want to print the W3, DO <font style="font-weight: bold;">NOT</font> 
 RESPOND TO THIS MESSAGE IMMEDIATELY. To print the W3 form, the user should 
 verify that all Copy A’s plus the summary page have been printed, and 
 then load the W3 form in the printer.</p>
<p style="margin-left: 8px;"><font style="font-weight: bold;">After</font> 
 the W3 form has been loaded, the user should then click Yes in the message 
 box to print the W3 form. Note that if taxes for more than one state have 
 been assessed, an X will be printed in the State portion of Box 15, and 
 the Employer’s state ID number will be blank.</p>
<h2>Important Fields:</h2>

  </p>
<p style="margin-left: 48px;"><font style="font-weight: bold;">Option A:</font><br/>
Option A should be used to print the red Copy A for the Social Security 
 Administration (unless filing electronically). One 2-up W2 form will be 
 printed for each employee with Federal/FICA wages plus a summary page 
 at the end of the run. This report will be ordered by the Sort Employees 
 By option. Note: in general, you would leave the Tax Authority Id, Type 
 and State fields blank for this run. The Employee Id range enables you 
 to reprint W2&#39;s for one or more employees or to print an alignment copy.</p>
<p style="margin-left: 48px;"><font style="font-weight: bold;">Option B:</font><br/>
Option B should be used to print the black Copy B to be filed with the 
 employee&#39;s Federal Tax Return. One 2-up W2 form will be printed for each 
 employee with Federal/FICA. This report will be ordered by the Sort Employees 
 By option. Note: in general, you would leave the Tax Authority Id, Type 
 and State fields blank for this run. The Employee Id range enables you 
 to reprint W2&#39;s for one or more employees or to print an alignment copy.</p>
<p style="margin-left: 48px;"><font style="font-weight: bold;">Option C:</font><br/>
Option C should be used to print the black Copy C to be retained by the 
 employee. One 2-up W2 form will be printed for each employee with Federal/FICA. 
 This report will be ordered by the Sort Employees By option. Note: in 
 general, you would leave the Tax Authority Id, Type and State fields blank 
 for this run. The Employee Id range enables you to reprint W2&#39;s for one 
 or more employees or to print an alignment copy.</p>
<p style="margin-left: 48px;"><font style="font-weight: bold;">Option D:</font><br/>
Option D should be used to print the black Copy D to be retained by the 
 employer. One 2-up W2 form will be printed for each employee with Federal/FICA 
 wages plus a summary page at the end of the run. This report will be ordered 
 by the Sort Employees By option. Note: in general, you would leave the 
 Tax Authority Id, Type and State fields blank for this run. The Employee 
 Id range enables you to reprint W2&#39;s for one or more employees or to print 
 an alignment copy.</p>
<p style="margin-left: 48px;"><font style="font-weight: bold;">Copy 1:</font><br/>
Copy 1 should be used to print the black Copy 1 to be delivered by the 
 employer to the State and Local Taxing Authorities. One 2-up W2 form will 
 be printed for each employee/taxing authority combination where the employee 
 earned wages. This report will be ordered by the Tax Authority Id first, 
 and the Sort Employees By option within each Taxing Authority. A summary 
 totals page will be produced for each taxing authority. In order to produce 
 separate runs for state and local authorities, you may wish to produce 
 one print run with the Type range completed as state, and another with 
 the Type specified as local.</p>
<p style="margin-left: 88px;"><span style="font-weight: bold;">TIP:</span> 
 Running with the  Type Range set to: <span style="font-weight: bold;">state,local</span> 
 will also provide summary totals pages for each Tax Authority. This eliminates 
 the need to run Copy 1 multiple times. See additional details in the Type 
 range documentation below. </p>
<p style="margin-left: 48px;"><font style="font-weight: bold;">Copy 2:</font><br/>
Copy 2 should be used to print the black Copy 2 to be filed with the employee&#39;s 
 State and Local Taxing Authorities. One 2-up W2 form will be printed for 
 each employee/taxing authority combination where the employee earned wages. 
 This report will be sorted by employee (in either Id or Last Name order) 
 so that all W2&#39;s for an employee will be printed together. See the &quot;Type&quot; 
 range for details on how to run Copy 2.</p>
<p><font style="font-weight: bold;">Sort Employee By: Last Name Social 
 Security Number</font><br/>
This option controls the output order of the W2&#39;s within taxing authority.

</font>The system sets Start Date(01/01) and the End Date (12/31) whenever 
 the Year field gets changed. These dates may not be edited by the user 
 unless enabled via registry. </p>
<p><font style="font-weight: bold;">Plain Paper Copy?</font><br/>
If this field is checked, the system will produce an informational report 
 that includes header information for each field. DO NOT check this box 
 when aligning or printing live copies of the W2&#39;s.</p>

<p><font style="font-weight: bold;">State Id:</font><br/>
This field enables you to only print W2&#39;s for a single state or series 
 of states: <span style="font-weight: bold;">be sure to enter the two character 
 state abbreviation!</span>. It is not recommended for Copy Options A,B,C 
 or D.</p>

 Copy Options A,B,C or D.</p>
<p style="margin-left: 48px;"><font style="font-weight: bold;">Tip: Avoiding 
 Unnecessary Printing - Copy 1 and Copy 2<br/>
Most users would enter</font> <font style="font-weight: bold;">state,local 
 </font>in the Type range field to print employer W2&#39;s with totals for 
 each state and local Tax Authority.</p>
<p style="margin-left: 48px;"><span style="font-weight: bold;">If your 
 data is configured with Other as being a Local tax</span>, then run Copy 
 1 and Copy 2 using Type: <span style="font-weight: bold;">state,local,other</span> 
 skipping SUTA,SUI,etc. in the Tax Authority Id: range (set to ~SUTA,SUI).</p>
<p><font style="font-weight: bold;">Employee Id:</font><br/>
This field enables you to only print W2&#39;s for a single employee or series
