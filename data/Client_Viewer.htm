<h1>Client Viewer</h1>
<h3>Purpose:</h3>
<p>Create/maintain the master record for a client; including the correspondence 
 address, and AR information. The primary function of the client record 
 is to provide an element for which A/R will be aged. A client may be an 
 individual, a multi-store franchise, a general contractor, or some other 
 business or institution for which your firm does work. A client record 
 should be created at the level that A/R is monitored (regardless of where 
 the invoice itself is sent).</p>
<p style="margin-left: 48px;"><font style="font-weight: bold;">Clients 
 and Sites Linked by Jobs<br/>
</font>Since a Site is not permanently tied to one specific Client, jobs 
 for a specific site may be billed to a variety of clients. The Site and 
 the Client are independently specified in the Job record. Consider a construction 
 job for a school. In this situation, jobs at this site might be pointed 
 at client records for: the school district, the contractor of record, 
 and the manufacturer of the equipment being installed.</p>
<p style="margin-left: 48px;"><span style="font-weight: bold;">Clients 
 and Sites for COP (Client Order Processing)</span><br/>
Client Orders are not Job-based. In this case, the Client specified on 
 the Site&#39;s COP tab will be associated with the AR for that Site. <br/>
</p>
<h2>Usage:</h2>
<p><img src="assets/images/SKIN1_Collection.bmp" alt="" style="border: none;" align="left" border="0"/> When you click the Collection button on the Client 
 viewer&#39;s top button bar, the screen will toggle to display a collections 
 processing view for this client. This view lets you drill down to invoice 
 detail, receivables, and collections notes for this customer. Click <a href="Client_Collections_Screen.htm">Client Collections Screen</a> 
 for details.</p>
<h3>Registries:</h3>
<p><a href="Registry_Client_Viewer_sys_viewer_vclnt_.htm">Client Registry</a> 
 - Client Collections and Client options. </p>
<p>By default, data entry in the State / Province address field is limited 
 to the official abbreviations of the US States and Canadian Provinces. 
 See the <a href="Registry_Entry_Global_Settings__Column_Compression__Dispatch_Board_Rows__History_Log_Inventory_Markup.htm#Global_Settings_State_Id">State 
 / Province Field Validation Registry</a> if you need to add to or change 
 the list of valid State / Province codes. </p>
<p>Registries to <a href="Interest_Registry_Entry_Set_Disabled_Fields.htm">Set 
 Disabled Fields</a> and <a href="Internal_Registry_Set_Required_Fields.htm">Set 
 Required Fields</a>. </p>
<h2>Important Fields:</h2>
<p><font style="font-weight: bold;">Note:</font> this Help Topic lists 
 the standard configuration of all fields that may be included in this 
 record. If you are using a customized system, the fields displayed on 
 your screen may not exactly match the order or status (required, optional, 
 default, display-only, hidden, etc.) of the fields described in this Topic.</p>
<p><font style="font-weight: bold;">Client Id:</font> (15 character, only 
 . and - special characters)<br/>
A unique Id for this client. This required field may include letters, numbers, 
 and the special characters period <font style="font-weight: bold;">.</font> 
 and hyphen <font style="font-weight: bold;">-</font>.</p>
<p><font style="font-weight: bold;">Client Name:</font> (40 character)<br/>
The name of the business.</p>
<p><font style="font-weight: bold;">Client Alpha Id:</font> (40 character)<br/>
This field defaults from the Client Name. It may be used to enter an alternative 
 look-up key.</p>
<p><font style="font-weight: bold;">Voice Phone:</font>  <font style="font-weight: bold;">Fax 
 Phone:</font><br/>
Enter the main corporate numbers.</p>
<p><font style="font-weight: bold;">Date Opened:</font>  <font style="font-weight: bold;">Date 
 Closed:</font><br/>
The opening and closing date for this Client&#39;s account. When you create 
 a new Client record, the Date Opened will default to today&#39;s date. You 
 may access the Calendar Viewer to enter or change a date by double-clicking 
 (or by pressing Alt-F7) on either of these fields. To enter today&#39;s date, 
 simply press Spacebar.</p>
<p>If you flag a record as Inactive, if the Date Closed (Inactive) field 
 is blank it will automatically be set to today&#39;s date. If you change a 
 record to <font style="font-style: italic;">anything other than</font> 
 the Inactive status, the Date Closed field will automatically be cleared.</p>
<p><font style="font-weight: bold;">Template<br/>
</font>This field may not be checked or cleared in the Client viewer; if 
 checked, it indicates that it is a template record that was created for 
 job cloning purposes or for use with COD jobs where the Client will never 
 be assessed any AR. The Client Templates viewer must be used to edit Client 
 Template records.</p>
<p><font style="font-weight: bold;">Account Manager Id:</font><br/>
This optional field identifies the manager in charge of this client account. 
 If your company uses this field, double-click on it (or press Alt+F7) 
 to select from a list of account managers.</p>
<p><font style="font-weight: bold;">Sales Rep Id:<br/>
</font>The primary Sales Rep for this Client. Optional.</p>
<p><font style="font-weight: bold;">Mailing Address:</font><br/>
Enter the correspondence address for this client. Note that if there is 
 a <a href="Client_Site_Billing_Address.htm">Billing Address Id</a> in 
 the Job record (and your invoicing format supports this feature), the 
 information in the Billing Address record will override both the Client 
 Site Invoice Address and the Client information.</p>
<p><font style="font-weight: bold;">Credit Limit:</font> (8 numeric)<br/>
The credit limit for this account in dollars. This field is checked when 
 a Client Order is created or when a New Call is entered. When entering 
 a Client Order and it exceeds the Limit, a user with Credit Manager Authorization 
 must approve it. When entering a New Call and the client has exceeded 
 their credit limit the new work order will be placed on HOLD and must 
 be approved/released by a Credit Manager (unless this behavior is disabled 
 via registry for New Call). An amount of Zero represents NO CREDIT where 
 and amount of 99,999,999 would represent Unlimited Credit. The default 
 on this field is zero.</p>
<p><font style="font-weight: bold;">Tax Exemption Id:</font> (20 character)<br/>
If this client has tax exempt status, enter their Tax Exemption Certification 
  ID number.</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: bold;">Tax Exempt Expiration:</span><br/>
The date the Client&#39;s Tax Exempt Certification expires.  This field 
 is currently for informational purposes only.</p>
<p><font style="font-weight: bold;">Credit Card #:</font>(30 character) <font style="font-weight: bold;">Credit Card Expiration Date:</font> (mmddyyyy 
 format)<br/>
These fields are deprecated.  We recommended using <a href="Registry_Electronic_Payment_Credit_Card_Processing.htm">EPI 
 Electronic Payment</a> or <a href="APT_Payment_Processing_Overview.htm">Open 
 Edge</a> to securely store an alias in the Client Site record.  </p>
<p><font style="font-weight: bold;">Charge Interest:</font><br/>
Reserved for future use. </p>
<p><font style="font-weight: bold;">Market Source Id:</font><br/>
This optional field identifies how this customer was generated (referral, 
 brochure, etc.). By tracking the market source, you can evaluate which 
 of your advertising efforts are most effective. </p>
<p><font style="font-weight: bold;">Client Contact:</font>  <font style="font-weight: bold;">Accounts Payable:</font><br/>
The First Name, Last Name, Salutation, Title, Phone ,Cell Phone and Fax 
 numbers, and Email Address of your primary and AP contacts for this client. 
 These fields are optional but recommended; the email address will appear 
 on the cc: list for work orders related to this client.</p>
<p><font style="font-weight: bold;">C of A Requirement:</font> <font style="font-weight: bold;">None 
 W/Shpmnt W/Shpmnt + Fax<br/>
</font>This field pertains to the Certificate of Analysis documents produced 
 when a Client Order Pick Ticket is recorded in Client Order Processing.</p>
<p style="margin-left: 36.00pt;">If <span style="font-weight: bold;">None</span> 
 is selected (by double-clicking on the radio button adjacent to this option), 
 this document need not be produced.</p>
<p style="margin-left: 36.00pt;">If <span style="font-weight: bold;">W/Shpmnt</span> 
 is selected, the message &#39;Client Requires a C of A&#39; will appear when recording 
 the pick ticket; the user can then print the C of A from the Record Pick 
 Ticket screen.</p>
<p style="margin-left: 36.00pt;">If <span style="font-weight: bold;">W/Shpmnt 
 + Fax</span> is selected, the message &#39;Client Requires a C of A&#39; will 
 appear when recording the pick ticket; two copies of the C of A (one designated 
 as a FAX) will be printed by clicking the CofA button.</p>
<p><font style="font-weight: bold;">Status:</font><br/>
Select a status for this client by double-clicking on the circular radio 
 button next to the desired status (keyboard users should Tab to the desired 
 button and then press the Spacebar to select it):<br/>
 <font color="#0000FF">Active</font> if this is a current client<br/>
 <font color="#0000FF">Inactive</font> if the account is closed<br/>
 <font color="#0000FF">Mail List</font> if this is a sales prospect<br/>
 If <font color="#0000FF">Credit Hold</font> is selected, the system 
 will alert you if a Client Order/Work Order is entered for this customer</p>
<p>By default, the Client list is automatically filtered so that it opens 
 displaying only Active records. This feature applies to both Simplified 
 Take-Back viewers (left double-click) and Standard (right-click) viewers.</p>
<p>If you flag a record as Inactive, if the Date Closed (Inactive) field 
 is blank it will automatically be set to today&#39;s date. If you change a 
 record to Active status, the Date Closed field will automatically be cleared.</p>
<p><img src="assets/images/SKIN1_FilterClear.bmp" alt="" style="border: none;" border="0"/> 
 To see all Client Records, go to the List view and then click the All 
 records button. All records (regardless of their status) will be displayed 
 within your security parameters. Clicking this button also blanks all 
 Filter range entries entered manually (or by the system for operating 
 company/branch security).</p>
<p><img src="assets/images/image/SKIN1_FilterInactive.gif" alt="" style="border: none;" border="0"/> To show Inactive Records Only (those with a status 
 of Inactive and a Closed Date) by clicking the Closed filter button.</p>
<p class="Tip_Note_Heading" style="margin-top: 4.00pt;">Email Addresses:<br/>
Email Address:   Fax Email:   Email Address 2: 
 <font style="font-weight: normal;">(formerly Email Pager)</font></p>
<p>The default email addresses for this customer.  If you wish to 
 specify more than one address, you may specify an <a href="Email_Group.htm">Email 
 Group</a> or include multiple email addresses (comma or semi-colon delimited) 
 in the email address field. </p>
<p><font style="font-weight: bold;">Collections Email: Collections 
 Subject:<br/>
</font>The default email address and subject line for collections processing 
 (from the Collections button). If you decide to e-mail your customer a 
 copy of an invoice from the Collections screen, these fields will provide 
 the default address and subject line. If you wish to specify more 
 than one address, you may specify an <a href="Email_Group.htm">Email Group</a> 
 or include multiple email addresses (comma or semi-colon delimited) in 
 the email address field. </p>
<p><font style="font-weight: bold;">Service Manager:<br/>
</font>Enter a valid Service Manager Id or double-click to select from 
 a list. For PM Work Orders, the Service Account Manager defaults from 
 <font style="font-family: Tahoma;" face="Tahoma">the Site Equipment record 
 or, if blank, from the Site record, or if blank, from the Job&#39;s Client 
 record.</font></p>
<p><span><font style="font-family: Tahoma;" face="Tahoma">For New Call, 
 </font>the Client is included the  Service Manager defaulting. The 
 hierarchy is as follows: Client Site Equipment - Client Site - Client 
 - User. The Service Manager selected when the Work Order is added will 
 be written to the new Work Order. </span></p>
<p><font style="font-weight: bold;">Client User 1:  Client User 2:</font>(30 
 character)<br/>
These optional fields may be used for entering any information your company 
 wishes to retain (e.g., additional account numbers).</p>
<p><font style="font-weight: bold;">New Call AR Warning Days<br/>
<span style="font-weight: normal;">If this</span></font> field is set to 
 greater then zero, it is used in conjunction with New Call to check receivables 
 status by comparing it against the actual age of the Client&#39;s receivables. 
 If the age of the receivables exceeds the value of the New Call AR Warning 
 Days field, New Call automatically displays the aging summary for this 
 Client. Setting this field to 0 effectively removes this functionality. 
 <font style="font-weight: bold;">Note that this warning is only displayed 
 once per Client each time you start up New Call</font>.</p>
<p><font style="font-weight: bold;">Days Credit Hold:<br/>
</font>The purpose of this field is to aid in auto-setting both Client 
 Orders and Work Orders to a status of Credit Hold when the client has 
 outstanding receivables older than the value entered in this field. </p>
<p class="Reference_Line" style="margin-left: 36.00pt; margin-bottom: 0.00pt;"><font style="font-weight: bold;">Work Orders:<br/>
</font>When Work Orders are created (in New Call or by Create PM Workorders), 
 the Client referenced in the Job record will be checked for overdue receivables. 
 The status of the work order will be set to Credit Hold if any receivables 
 exceed the number of Credit Hold Days for the Client referenced in the 
 Job record. <span style="font-weight: bold;">However, if the Client&#39;s 
 Days Credit Hold = 0, this piece of the credit checking is ignored.</span> 
 If a work order is placed on credit hold, it will not be visible on the 
 dispatch board, and cannot be changed except by credit managers.</p>
<p style="margin-left: 36.00pt;"><font style="font-weight: bold;">Client 
 Orders:<br/>
</font>When Client Orders are created, the Client referenced on the Client 
 Site COP tab will be checked for overdue receivables. If the client has 
 outstanding receivables older than the value entered in this field, the 
 order must be created with the Order Type of ‘Hold’ or ‘Quote’. It may 
 be released by a Credit Manager to enable processing as an Order.</p>
<p><font style="font-weight: bold;">Currency Id:<br/>
</font>If you will be billing your foreign clients in their currency, and 
 receiving their payments in their currency, this field must be completed. 
 If you are updating an existing Client record, this field must only be 
 changed if there is no current activity on the account (e.g, unpaid bills). 
 In this way, new invoices will be sent and received in the Client’s currency. 
 If you cannot clear an account, you may need to create a new client and 
 job records so that all new revenues will be in the correct (foreign) 
 denomination.</p>
<p class="Reference_Line" style="margin-bottom: 0.00pt;"><font style="font-weight: bold;">Sales 
 Lead Time:</font><font style="font-weight: bold;"><br/>
</font>This display-only field is used in conjunction with Corporate Metrics.</p>
<p><font style="font-weight: bold;">Charge Repack?</font><br/>
This field is used in Client Order Processing to determine the repack charges 
 (if any) to be assessed. Repack charges will default on Client Orders 
 for Sites that reference this Client (on the Site COP tab) if the following 
 are all true:</p>
<p style="margin-left: 36.00pt;">- this field is flagged.</p>
<p style="margin-left: 36.00pt;">- the Inventory Item being order specifies 
 a Repack Table.</p>
<p style="margin-left: 36.00pt;">- the quantity ordered falls below the 
 Standard Container quantity in the inventory item record and the Order 
 is not a Sample Order.</p>
<p><font style="font-weight: bold;">Security Id:</font><br/>
If multiple location security is implemented on your centralized database 
 system, this informational field displays the Security Id of the local 
 user that created this record. If multiple location security is not implemented 
 on your system, or if a global user created this record, this field will 
 be blank.</p>
