<h1>Job Billing Item Change Order Viewer</h1>
<h2>Purpose:</h2>
<p>The system now supports separate viewers for Billing Items that are 
 Change Orders and those that are not.  Note that these different 
 viewers do NOT change the basic functionality associated with Billing 
 Items.</p>
<p>The Change Order viewer should be used to create and maintain job-specific 
 change order records. Note that only job billing items that are flagged 
 as Change Orders appear in this viewer.</p>
<p><font style="font-weight: bold;">Upgrade Notes:<br/>
</font>During the data conversion, a Job Billing Item will be flagged as 
 Change Order if any of the following fields have been set: Contract Changes, 
 C.O. Date Requested, and C.O. Date Approved. However, a Billing Item will 
 not be flagged as a Change Order if the Original Contract Amount field 
 is completed, regardless of how the above fields are set. .</p>
<h2>Usage:</h2>
<p>Referenced in Records: Work Order, Client Site, Purchase Order, Shop 
 Order, Job Cost Code.<br/>
Referenced in Journals: Job, AP, Inventory/PO Receipt, Labor, AR Sales, 
 and Cash Receipts.</p>
<p>Job Billing Change Orders attached to Job Template records may only 
 be edited by users with access to Job Templates via their User Groups.</p>
<h2>Registry Entries:</h2>
<p>A related registry entry may be enabled to limit the Job Billing Item 
 Viewer to ONLY those records that are not Change Orders: see <a href="Registry_Entry_Job_Billing_Item.htm">Registry 
 Entry Job Billing Item</a> for details.</p>
<p>Prevent Use of Completed Job Cost Codes and Billing Items</p>
<h2>Important Fields: Upper Section</h2>
<p class="Tab" style="background-color: #e5e5e5; border-top: 1.50pt solid #000000; 
	 border-bottom: 1.50pt solid #000000; border-left: 1.50pt solid #000000; 
	 border-right: 1.50pt solid #000000;">Main Tab</p>
<p><font style="font-weight: bold;">Bill Item Id:</font><br/>
This required alphanumeric field must uniquely identify this Change Order 
 for Job it is associated with. For example, Job 100 and Job 200 could 
 each have a Job Billing Item with the Id &quot;Main&quot;.</p>
<p><font style="font-weight: bold;">Bill</font> <font style="font-weight: bold;">Item 
 Description:</font><br/>
Briefly describes this Billing Item Change Order. Recommended but not required.</p>
<p><font style="font-weight: bold;">Job Id:</font><br/>
The Job this Billing Item Change Order is associated with. Enter a valid 
 Job Id or press Alt+F7 (or double-click) to select from a list of jobs. 
 The system checks Job History before allowing you to change the Job Id. 
 If any history is found, you will not be allowed to change the Job Id.</p>
<p><font style="font-weight: bold;">OK to Bill?</font><br/>
Check this box (by double-clicking or pressing the Spacebar) if it is OK 
 to bill for this Billing Item.</p>





<p><font style="font-weight: bold;">PO#</font><br/>
The Client&#39;s Purchase Order number for this Billing Item Change Order.</p>
<p><font style="font-weight: bold;">Retainage %</font><br/>
The default retainage (or holdback) percent for this change order. Be sure 
 that the GL Retainage Account field on the Job Record’s Financial tab 
 is completed if the Retainage % is filled in. The GL Retainage Account 
 in the Job record will be debited when the Job Invoice is posted.</p>
<p><font style="font-weight: bold;">Date Started:</font><br/>
When creating a new Change Order, the Date Started will default to today’s 
 date.</p>
<p><font style="font-weight: bold;">Date Completed:</font><br/>
The Date Completed field enables you to indicate that a Change Order has 
 been finished. This field is referenced when entering labor, material 
 or other charges to this Change Order. If the Effective Date of the entry 
 exceeds the Date Completed, the system will warn you of the problem but 
 will not prevent the transaction from being saved unless the <a href="Registry_Entry_Global_Settings__Column_Compression__Dispatch_Board_Rows__History_Log_Inventory_Markup.htm#Registry_Entry_Global_Settings_Completed_JC">Prevent 
 Use of Completed Job Cost Codes and Billing Items</a> registry option 
 is implemented.</p>
<p><font style="font-weight: bold;">Fixed Fee Billings?</font><br/>
Check this box (by double-clicking or pressing the Spacebar) if this change 
 order is used for fixed-fee billings.</p>
<p><font style="font-weight: bold;">Allow Extras?</font><br/>
Check this box (by double-clicking or pressing the Spacebar) if Extras 
 are allowed on this change order.</p>
<p style="margin-left: 8px;"><span style="font-weight: bold;">Include 
 in GMP?</span><br/>
This field must be checked if this Change Order should be included in GMP 
 Revenue Adjustment calculations. If this field is checked, the Fixed Fee 
 box MUST be blank.</p>
<p><font style="font-weight: bold;">Fee Taxable?</font><br/>
If this is a Fixed Fee change order and it is taxable, flag this field 
 by double-clicking or pressing the Spacebar. This enables the Record Billing 
 Adjustments Journal to populate the TAX tab’s Tax Authorities when the 
 Compute Tax button is pressed.</p>
<p><font style="font-weight: bold;">CO Amount:</font><br/>
The dollar amount for this change order.  </p>
<p>For GMP type Jobs, changes to this 
 field are validated against the Job&#39;s GMP Contract Total field. The sum 
 of the C.O. Amount (in Change Orders) and Contract Amount (in Billing 
 Items) may not exceed the GMP Contract Total.</p>
<p>If this CO was created from a Change 
 Request, this field will be generated from the Change Request&#39;s Budgeted 
 Revenue. If Change Requests were attached to this Change Order, this field 
 should be manually updated to include the attached Change Requests.</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: bold;">Expected 
 Cost:</span><br/>
 If this CO was created from a Change 
 Request, this field will be generated from the Change Request&#39;s Budgeted 
 Costs. If Change Requests were attached to this Change Order, this field 
 should be manually updated to include the budgeted cost on the attached 
 Change Requests.</p>
<p><font style="font-weight: bold;">Currency</font> <font style="font-weight: bold;">Id:</font> 
 <font style="font-weight: bold;"><br/>
</font>If this is a foreign client the display-only Currency Id will appear. 
 If so, the Original Contract and Contract Changes fields must be entered 
 in terms of the foreign revenue the Client will be billed in.</p>
<p><font style="font-weight: bold;">CO Date Requested CO Date Approved</font><br/>
These fields assist in AIA Billing and informational purposes. When a Change 
 Order is requested, a new record would be created fro the applicable job. 
 The CO Date Requested field would be filled in, but the Change Order would 
 not be marked as Ok to Bill. When the Change Order was approved, the CO 
 Date Approved field would be completed. Depending upon the circumstances, 
 it might or might not be flagged as OK to Bill at this time.</p>
<p><font style="font-weight: bold;">Status<br/>
</font>This optional field references the Job Billing Item Status record. 
 Although this field has NO meaning in SAM Pro, it is designed for use 
 on reports designed by the users, often in conjunction with tracking change 
 order type billing items.</p>
<p><img alt="" src="assets/images/AttachCORs.bmp" style="border: none;" border="0"/>  When this 
 button is clicked,  the system will determine if any <a href="Job_Billing_Item_Change_Order_Request.htm">Change 
 Requests</a> are eligible for attachment to this Change Order. If any 
 are found, a checklist will be displayed, allowing the user to select 
 which ones to attach. Budgets entered on the Change Request&#39;s BudgetEntry 
 tab will be used to generate corresponding entries to the Job&#39;s Budget 
 tab at 100% likelihood.Any accumulated T&amp;M Revenue will generate offsetting 
 postings in the current accounting period if it is converted to Fixed 
 Fee. <span style="font-style: italic; font-weight: bold;">It is the user&#39;s 
 responsibility to manually enter update all appropriate values in the 
 Change Order including the CO Amount and CO Cost when attaching to a Change 
 Order!  </span></p>
<p><font style="font-weight: bold;">Invoice Description:</font><br/>
A 3000 character description to appear on the Client&#39;s invoice.</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: bold;">% 
 Likelihood:</span><br/>
 This field is reserved for future use 
 in SAMPro&#39;s Job EOM function. <br/>
