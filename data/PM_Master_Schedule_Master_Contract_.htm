<h1>Master Contract</h1>
<h2>Purpose:</h2>
<p class="Body_Text_2" style="margin-left: 5.75pt;">Master Contract is 
 designed to streamline the process of generating the PM Schedules and 
 Billings from a single viewer.</p>
<p>When a Master Contract is completed correctly, and the Create PM Billing 
 and Create PM Work Orders functions are run, the system will:</p>
<p style="margin-left: 36.00pt;">Check the Master Contract records and, 
 if applicable, create the appropriate lines on the Client Site Billing 
 Tab and the Client Site Equipment PM Schedule tabs.</p>
<p style="margin-left: 36.00pt;">Create the PM Invoices (advanced billing) 
 and the PM Work Orders if you check the Do boxes.</p>
<p>The system will not create duplicate lines for dates that are already 
 on the Client Site Billing Schedule or Client Site Equipment PM Schedule.</p>
<h3>Master Contract Equipment Table Option</h3>
<p><span>When the <a href="Registry_Entry_Global_Settings__Column_Compression__Dispatch_Board_Rows__History_Log_Inventory_Markup.htm#Use_Master_Contract_Equipment_Table">UseMasterContractEquipmentTable 
 global registry</a> set to true, it effectively allows for a single Client 
 Site Equipment (CSE) record to have simultaneous associations to multiple 
 Master Contracts.  By using this feature, the historical perspective 
 of all MC-CSE associations can be maintained rather than having to switch 
 equipment from one Master Contract to another when one ends and another 
 begins. Contact your support representative if you wish to enable this 
 functionality (not available for Sybase databases).</span></p>
<h2>Reports:</h2>
<p>See <a href="Report_PM_Work_Orders.htm">Report PM Work Orders</a> for 
 information on this useful report. This report is a &#39;predictor&#39;: it evaluates 
 the Master Contract data and the data residing in the Client Site Equipment 
 PM Schedule, and lists what PM Work Orders will be created when Start 
 Create PM WorkOrders is run. This report (RPMWRKORDRLST.rpt) must be imported 
 into your database before it can be run.</p>
<p>See <a href="Report_PM_Billing_List.htm">Report PM Billing List</a> 
 for details on running this useful ‘predictor’ report to see what will 
 be billings will be generated from the Master Contract as well as from 
 lines entered on the Client Site PM Billing schedule.</p>
<h2>Registry:</h2>
<p><span>See <a href="Registry_Entry_Global_Settings__Column_Compression__Dispatch_Board_Rows__History_Log_Inventory_Markup.htm#Use_Master_Contract_Equipment_Table">Global 
 Registry to Enable Master Contract Equipment Table</a> functionality to 
 allow equipment to be associated with multiple Master Contract. </span></p>
<p>See <a href="Registry_Entry_Master_Contract_PM_Master_Scheduler_.htm">Registry 
 Entry Master Contract (PM Master Scheduler)</a> to set the default GL 
 Accounts, Billing Items, and Work Codes to be used when clicking the Auto 
 Fill button to complete the Advanced Billing tab.</p>

 Use of Equipment Service Task when Master Contract PM&#39;s are Created</a>.</span></p>
<h2>Usage:</h2>
<p>PM Work Orders will only be generated for applicable Client Site Equipment 
 records if they are <font style="font-weight: bold;">Active</font> (e.g., 
 the Inactive box is not checked) and they are flagged as <font style="font-weight: bold;">Under 
 Contract</font> (this box is checked).</p>
<p>When the Start Create PM WO’s and Start Create PM Billing functions 
 are run, Client Site Equipment PM Schedule and Client Site PM Billing 
 lines will <font style="text-decoration: underline; ">not</font> be generated 
 from the Master Contract record if the Client Site status is set to Inactive 
 or Mail List. Lines will be generated for Sites whose status is set to 
 Credit Hold. PM Work Orders that are generated for Credit Hold sites will 
 be set to Credit Hold, and must be released by a Credit Manager.</p>
<p class="Reference_Line" style="margin-bottom: 0.00pt;">PM WorkOrders 
 will be generated to the Technician specified in the Client Site Equipment 
 record. If this Technician is a Subcontractor (with a Vendor Id included 
 in the Technician record), a PO will also be generated. The Sub&#39;s PO NTE 
 amount will be set to Cost amount on either the Inspections tab or the 
 Provider Rates tab on the Master Contract record.</p>
<p class="Reference_Line" style="margin-bottom: 0.00pt; margin-left: 48px;">If 
 you will be using the <font style="font-weight: bold;">Service Provider</font> 
 tab to define costs and revenue by Equipment Type, verify that the Equipment 
 Type field is correctly completed on the Client Sites Equipment record’s 
 Service tab.  </p>
<p class="Reference_Line" style="margin-bottom: 0.00pt; margin-left: 48px;"><span>A 
 <a href="Registry_Entry_Create_PM_WO.htm#Set_Sub_NTE_for_Master_Contracts_as_a_Last_Resort">Registry

<p style="margin-left: 8px;">The mstrcntrcteqpmntpm table contains data 
 for &#39;future&#39; Master Contract Inspections for KPI&#39;s; this table is updated 
 when Equipment and the Master Contract Records are changed. The Master 
 Contract’s Menu option Tools&gt;Rebuild Inspections re-syncs the mstrcntrcteqpmntpm 
 table if it has incorrect entries. Run this function after hours since 
 it can take a long time to complete!</p>
<p style="margin-left: 8px;">A registry entry is available to disable the 
 use of this table if it as not required for KPI&#39;s or other reporting; 
 see the Registry section of this topic.</p>
<h3>Multiple Tasks</h3>
<p>Master Contract accommodates multiple tasks for PM’s scheduled on the 
 same date and equipment. For example, if your Master Contract Schedule 
 tab includes two lines for the same day and month, but with different 
 Service Task Id’s, two corresponding lines will be generated to the Client 
 Site Equipment PM Schedule tab, and then to the PM Work Order Equipment 
 tab when Create PM Work Orders is run.</p>
<p style="margin-left: 48px;"><font style="font-weight: bold;">Note on 
 Renewing Multiple Tasks</font> <font style="font-weight: bold;">per Day 
 Contracts:</font><br/>
If multiple tasks per day have been manually scheduled, the Start Renew 
 Master Contract function should NOT be used to Renew the Master Contract; 
 the Renewal? flag must be blank in this case. These contracts should be 
 managed from the Master Contract itself.</p>
<h3>Multiple Contracts Use Master Contract Equipment Table Not Enabled</h3>
<p>When the <a href="Registry_Entry_Global_Settings__Column_Compression__Dispatch_Board_Rows__History_Log_Inventory_Markup.htm#Use_Master_Contract_Equipment_Table">UseMasterContractEquipmentTable 
 global registry</a> is NOT set to true, Master Contract accommodates multiple 
 contracts per Site by associating ALL contracts for that Site with the 
 Equipment. The following will occur when Start Create PM Work Orders is 
 run for Sites whose equipment is associated with one or more Master Contracts: 
  </p>
<p style="margin-left: 36.00pt;">- A Client Site Equipment record that 
 is flagged as Active and Under Contract – but <font style="text-decoration: underline; ">does 
 not</font> specify a Contract Id qualifies for ALL Contracts that include 
 the equipment&#39;s Site record. </p>
<p style="margin-left: 36.00pt;">- A Client Site Equipment record that 
 is flagged as Active and Under Contract that <font style="text-decoration: underline; ">does</font> 
 specify a Contract Id will ONLY be included as part of the specified Contract. </p>
<p><span>Note that separate work orders will be created for the different 
 Contracts.</span></p>
<h3>Master Contract Validations</h3>
<p>Since Master Contract Processing now supports multiple contracts per 
 Site, enhanced functionality and validations have been added to the Master 
 Contract viewer to support this.</p>
<p>1. Each time a Site Id is added to the Site List tab, the user will 
 be prompted with a warning message if the Site is referenced on another 
 Master Contract. </p>
<p>2. The Equipment tab right-click action has been enhanced to allow the 
 user to change the Contract the Equipment is assigned to. When the Equipment 
 record is already under contract on a different Master Contract, the right-click 
 generates the following message:</p>
<p style="margin-left: 36.00pt;">Selected Equipment record is already covered 
 by another contract.<br/>
Do you wish to reassign it to this contract?</p>
<p>Click Yes to reassign the Equipment to the current Contract. Note, however, 
 that to remove Equipment from all Master Contracts, you must do so from 
 the Master Contract record to which is is currently assigned.</p>
<p>3. The Equipment tab displays the equipment records for every site listed 
 on the Site List tab when the Master Contract Record is in Add mode. However, 
 a new Master Contract record must be saved before doing any right-click 
 processing on Equipment tab.</p>
<p>4. Leapday Not Allowed<span style="font-weight: bold;"><br/>
</span>February 29th (leapday) can cause issues with the new Master Contract 
 Equipment functionality as well as with scheduling / billing into coming 
 years that are not leap years. February 29th is not allowed to be entered 
 as a date in the Adv. Bill or Schedule tabs, or the Master Contract saved 
 with February 29th in the Adv. Bill or Schedule tabs; the error &quot;Invalid 
 Month Number Entered&quot; will be displayed if this date is found. </p>
<p>By default,  you can&#39;t adjust scheduled or billed lines that 
 have been generated but the following registry allows you to do so if 
 absolutely necessary to change 2/29 to 2/28 so a record can be saved:</p>
<p style="margin-left: 48px;"><font style="font-weight: bold;">Id:</font> 
 <font style="font-weight: bold;"> </font>sys-viewer-vmstrcntrct</p>
<p style="font-weight: bold; margin-left: 48px;"><span>Setting Key:</span><span style="font-weight: normal;"> RemoveValidations  </span><span>Setting 
 Value:</span><span style="font-weight: normal;"> true</span></p>
<h3>Foreign Currency Processing</h3>
<p>If foreign currency processing is implemented on your system (and this 
 Master Contract record is for a foreign customer), all Contract / Billing 
 / Earned amounts must be entered in terms of your customer’s currency.</p>

 Tab</p>
<p><font style="font-weight: bold;">Master Contract</font> <font style="font-weight: bold;">Id</font>:<br/>
This alphanumeric field must uniquely identify this record (ex. the Contract 
 Number).</p>
<p><font style="font-weight: bold;">Description:</font> (40 character)<br/>
Briefly describes this record; this field is recommended but not required.</p>
<p><font style="font-weight: bold;">Job Id: Cost Code: Billing Item: Cost 
 Category:<br/>
</font>These fields should only be filled in if one job (and one job only) 
 will be billed and costed to this contract. If these fields are completed, 
 the corresponding fields on the Site List tab must remain blank.</p>
<p>The Cost Category supports enhanced filtering provided by the Cost Code&#39;s 
 Job Cost Category Usage Filter. Cost Categories are validated (relative 
 to Cost Codes) during data entry upon leaving the Cost Category Id field. 
  The full relationship is validated again when leaving a child line 
 or saving a record.</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: bold;">Original Start Date:</span><br/>
This informational field may be used to record the original Start Date 
 of the Master Contract.</p>
<p><font style="font-weight: bold;">Start Date: End Date:<br/>
</font>These fields must define the period that this contract covers. The 
 system will use this range when computing the year(s) for the Billing 
 Dates (if applicable) and the PM Schedule dates when the Create PM Billing 
 and Create PM Work Order functions are run. When a contract is renewed, 
 only the End Date needs to be revised. These fields may be updated from 
 Setup/Renew tab when the Auto-Populate button is clicked.</p>
<p class="Body_Text_2" style="margin-left: 5.75pt;"><font style="font-weight: bold;">Contract 
 Total:<br/>
</font>This display-only field is based on the Contract Value fields on 
 the Site List tab or the Bill Amount fields on the Adv. Billing tab. It 
 enables you to verify that the billing detail you have entered will correctly 
 sum to the desired amount.</p>
<p class="Tip_Note_Heading" style="margin-top: 4.00pt;">Service Agreement 
 Type Id:<br/>
<font style="font-weight: normal;">Specifies the type of agreement this 
 contract represents. This optional field is for informational purposes.</font></p>
<p><font style="font-weight: bold;">Sales Rep Id:<br/>
</font>This field provides the default value for PM Work Orders generated 
 from this contract.</p>
<p><font style="font-weight: bold;">Acct Mgr Id:<br/>
</font>This field provides the default value for PM Work Orders generated 
 from this contract.</p>
<p><font style="font-weight: bold;">Commission%:<br/>
</font>This field provides the default value for PM Work Orders generated 
 from this contract.</p>
<p><font style="font-weight: bold;">Time of Service Bill?</font><br/>
This field enables the user to generate Time of Service Preventive Maintenance 
 Work Orders instead of pre-billing with a PM Invoice Work Order. The Contract 
 Value on the Site List will be evenly divided between all scheduled Preventive 
 Maintenance Work Orders when Start Create PM Workorders is run. If multiple 
 sites are included for this Master Contract, a separate work order (each 
 with the appropriate Contract Value) will be generated for Site per Inspection. 
 If multiple equipment is included in the contract, the Contract Value 
 will be evenly divided on the Other lines, each referencing a piece of 
 equipment.</p>
<p>If this box is flagged:</p>
<p style="margin-left: 36.00pt;">The Job used for PM Work Orders should 
 be flagged as Service Compute.</p>
<p style="margin-left: 36.00pt;">The system will not allow the Amortize 
 Revenue box to be set.</p>
<p style="margin-left: 36.00pt;">When the Auto Populate button is clicked, 
 the Revenue Amount is NOT set on the Schedule tab. Instead, the Contract 
 Amount(s) on the Site list are used to derive the appropriate values to 
 be written to the Work Order Other tab when Start Create PM Workorders 
 is run. </p>
<p style="margin-left: 36.00pt;">Note that if this Contract is assigned 
 to subcontractors, and the Provider Rates tab is used, only the Cost component 
 will be referenced, not the Revenue.</p>
<p><font style="font-weight: bold;">Time of Service Earn?<br/>
</font>This field provides a way to better match the revenue and expenses 
 associated with PM contracts.  Time-of-Service refers to the 
 fact that the revenue is recognized at the time the PM Inspection work 
 order is completed, as opposed a defined earnings schedule. The system 
 will recognize an accrued liability when the contract invoices are generated, 
 and relieve this liability and recognize income upon printing and posting 
 the PM work order.</p>
<p>If this field is flagged, the Site Equipment PM Schedule&#39;s Accrued flag 
 will be checked. When PM Work Orders are generated, they will include 
 two lines on the Revenue Adjustments tab.  One is for recognizing 
 the PM Income.  The line designated as &#39;ApplyPrepaid&#39; will relieve 
 the accrued liability.  Note that the Time Of Service Billed 
 and the Time of Service Earn fields cannot both be flagged.</p>
<p style="margin-left: 36.00pt;"><font style="font-weight: bold;">Important:</font> 
 *ACCRUAL* is used as a special marker when PM Work Orders are generated; 
 these lines will not post directly to JCH.  When the PM Invoice is 
 printed and posted, the appropriate GL and Job Cost entries will be made 
 to recognize the earned revenue values.</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: bold;">Multiple Sites and Revenue Proration:</span> 
 Version 9.1 allows for handling of multiple sites when TimeOfService Earn? 
 is set to Y. Additionally, when Revenue Values as %? is set to Y along 
 with TimeOfService Earn? users may specify a percentage value in Revenue 
 Per Visit on each Schedule line of the contract.</p>
<p>If all Schedule lines for the Site have $0 Revenue Per Visit, TOS Earned 
 is checked  and the Revenue as Percent box is blank, the Site&#39;s Total 
 Contract amount is treated as evenly distributed across the Equipment&#39;s 
 PMSchedule Contract Values for Scheduled lines. </p>
<p>When both the TimeOfService? and Revenue Values as %? fields are set 
 to Y with multiple sites specified - the system calculates the percentage 
 of revenue specified in the Revenue Per Visit field based on the Site 
 Contract Value. This percentage is reflected in the RevAdjust lines on 
 the Preventive Maintenance Work Order generated through Start Create PM 
 Workorders. The sum of the Revenue Per Visit on all Schedule lines must 
 equal 100% in the Master Contract record. If the user fails to enter a 
 percentage in the Revenue Per Visit field the system will evenly prorate 
 the revenue.</p>
<p style="margin-left: 48px;"><span>Note - the Advanced Billing will still 
 be prorated evenly across all months set to Bill? on the Setup/Renew tab 
 of the Master Contract.</span></p>
<p><font style="font-weight: bold;">Revenue Values as %</font><font style="font-weight: bold;">:<br/>
</font>This field enables the user to designate the Revenue specified on 
 the PM Schedule line of a master contract as a percentage instead of a 
 dollar amount for Time Of Service Bill invoices. If TimeOfService Bill 
 is not specified, the Amount Billed on the Adv. Bill tab will be calculated 
 as a percentage. If Amortization is enabled, the Amount Earned is also 
 calculated as a percentage.</p>
<p>When generating Time of Service Earn PM Work Orders or PM Billings, 
 the system will calculate the billable amount for as a percentage of the 
 annual contract amount specified on the Client Site list. Amortized amounts 
 will similarly be generated using the Amount Earned percentage in the 
 Scheduled tab.</p>
<p>When the user saves the record, the system will verify that the sum 
 of the Revenue percentages totals 100.00.</p>
<p style="font-weight: bold;"><span style="font-weight: bold;">Schedule 
 Hours as %<br/>
<span style="font-weight: normal;">If this field is flagged, the system 
 will treat the Hours on the Schedule tab as a percentage field and calculate 
 the estimated hours as a percentage of the Total Site Hours on the site 
 tab. The estimated hours will be distributed across any equipment lines 
 added to the subsequent PM work order so that the total estimated hours 
 for the PM work order equals the calculated percentage hours.</span></span></p>
<p style="font-weight: normal;">The following fields are used in conjunction 
 with this field:</p>
<p style="margin-left: 48px;"><span style="font-weight: bold;">Site List 
 Tab - Total Site Hours</span><br/>
This field allows the total estimated hours to be assigned on a Site by 
 Site basis. This field is used in conjunction with the Schedule Hours 
 as % field on the Main tab.</p>
<p style="margin-left: 48px;"><span style="font-weight: bold;">Schedule 
 Tab - Hours</span><br/>
If the Schedule Hours as % field is flagged, the system treats this as 
 a percentage field and calculates the estimated hours as a percentage 
 of the Total Site Hours. The total hours on this tab sum to 100.00 (100%).</p>
<p style="margin-left: 48px;"><span style="font-weight: bold;">Setup Renew 
 Tab Autopopulate</span><br/>
If the Schedule Hours as % field on the Main Tab is flagged, clicking this 
 button will populate the Schedule Tab with the 100% of hours evenly divided 
 among the inspections; they may be adjusted by the users.  </p>
<p><font style="font-weight: bold;">Master Contract User 1 – 5:<br/>
</font>These optional fields are for informational / reporting purposes.</p>
<p><span><img src="assets/images/BuildOutPMWOs.bmp" alt="" style="border: none;" border="0"/> 
 The Build Out PM WOs will be available to all installs using the Master 
 Contract Equipment table in a future release. The Build Out button may 
 be disabled via registry if needed.</span></p>
<p><font style="font-weight: bold;">Cancelled Date</font><font style="font-weight: bold;">:</font><br/>
This date is used in conjunction with Create PM Billings and WO’s to prevent 
 their generation <font style="text-decoration: underline; ">past the Cancelled

<p>This tab is designed to enable you to quickly generate or update the 
 entries on the Advanced Billing and/or Schedule tabs. If you are updating 
 your contract with this tab, be sure that all PM’s and Billings for the 
 current contract year have already been generated (with the Create PM 
 WO’s and Create PM Billings functions).</p>
<p>The following validation is checked when AutoPopulate is pushed...<br/>
1. New Start Date cannot precede Old End Date.<br/>
2. New End Date cannot precede New Start Date.<br/>
3. When Amortize Revenue is true, at least one of the monthly Earn? boxes 
 must be checked.<br/>
4. At least one of the monthly Bill? boxes must be checked if an Annual 
 Amount is specified.</p>
<p>5. When adjusting existing lines for the current date range, the user 
 is only restricted from using the AutoPopulate button if any of the existing 
 scheduled or billed lines have been used to generate corresponding lines 
 in the Client Site PM Billing or Client Site Equipment PM tables.</p>
<p>Alternately, the <a href="Start_Renew_Master_Contract.htm">Start Renew 
 Master Contract</a> function may be used to update this contract.</p>
<h3 style="margin-left: 36.00pt;">Specify Inspection Intervals Functionality</h3>
<p style="margin-left: 36.00pt;">In addition to auto-populating the inspection 
 lines on a monthly (implemented by flagging the desired Inspection months) 
 or day of the week (e.g, by flagging the first and third Tuesday of the 
 month), you may use a third option which allows the user to specify a 
 start date and the number of days (interval) until the following inspection.  This 
 option is implemented as follows.</p>
<p style="margin-left: 36.00pt;">1. Complete the fields (Job, Start and 
 End Date, Contract Amount, etc.) not pertaining to pm scheduling. You 
 must flag at least one Bill Date. Do NOT flag any of the Monthly or Day 
 of the Month inspection boxes.</p>
<p style="margin-left: 36.00pt;">2. Click the Auto Populate button. If 
 none of the Inspection boxes are flagged, the system will open a Prompt 
 window that requests the First Inspection Date and the Interval(Days). </p>
<p style="margin-left: 36.00pt;"><font style="font-weight: bold;">First 
 Inspection Date:</font><br/>
The system uses the Contract Start Date the default date for the First 
 Inspection, but this may be adjusted by the user (note that the date must 
 fall between the Contract Start and End Dates).</p>
<p style="margin-left: 36.00pt;"><font style="font-weight: bold;">Interval 
 (Days):<br/>
</font>This field defaults to zero, but must be set to greater than zero 
 and less than 29. For example, if your first inspection date is 1/3/2010 
 and your Interval is set to 10 days, inspections will be scheduled on 
 the 1/3/2010, 1/13/2010, 1/23/2010 and so on.</p>
<p style="margin-left: 36.00pt;">3. Click OK. The auto-populate logic will 
 create Inspection lines starting with the First Inspection Date and then 
 every Interval(Days) afterwards throughout the duration of the contract.</p>
<p><font style="font-weight: bold;">Auto Populate Button:<br/>
</font>When you click this button, the contents of this tab will be used 
 to revise the Adv. Bill and Schedule tabs, and the contract Start and 
 End Dates on the Main tab. If the Schedule Hours as % field on the Main 
 Tab is flagged, clicking this button will populate the Schedule Tab with 
 the 100% of hours evenly divided among the inspections; they may be adjusted 
 by the users.  </p>
<p style="margin-left: 48px;"><span style="text-decoration: underline; ">TimeOfService 
 Bill:</span> For Master Contracts flagged as TimeOfService Bill, the Revenue 
 amount will not be set in the Schedule tab when this button is clicked. 
 Instead, the Contract Amount(s) on the Site list are used to derive the 
 appropriate values to be written to the Work Order Other tab when Start 
 Create PM Workorders is run. </p>
<p>Where possible, the system will maintain existing values when a Billing 
 or  Schedule line corresponding to the lines already present instead 
 of regenerating the whole tab from scratch.  This allows the 
 user to update the Billing or Schedule tabs on an existing Master Contract, 
 or a cloned contract without having to manually reset individual fields. 
 For the Schedule tab: </p>
<p style="margin-left: 48px;">For the PartType Flag setting &amp; SvcTaskId 
 - use the current values on the Schedule tab when Setup/Renew is pressed.</p>
<p style="margin-left: 48px;">For Hours, Work Code, EscProfile - when corresponding 
 Parent Setup/Renew tab fields are NOT set, use the existing Schedule tab 
 values. </p>
<p style="margin-left: 48px;">For Work Code, EscProfile.values - when corresponding 
 Parent Setup/Renew tab fields ARE set use them to reset lines that do 
 not have corresponding values.  </p>
<p style="margin-left: 48px;"><span>Always Refresh &lt;Da&gt; value per 
 designated Wks. Day setting on parent and Hours if set in the parent. 
 </span></p>
<p>See <a href="Registry_Entry_Master_Contract_PM_Master_Scheduler_.htm">Registry 
 Entry Master Contract (PM Master Scheduler)</a> for a registry option 
 that enables you to specify the work codes to be associated with inspections 
 on a month-by-month basis as well as the GL Accounts when the Auto Populate 
 button is clicked.</p>
<p><b>Contact Total:<br/>
</b>This display field calculates the total amount of the contract for 
 all Sites when Auto Populate is hit. It is maintained by the system based 
 on how the contract is configured - Amount By Site from the Site list 
 and the Revenue Values from the Schedule list tab.</p>
<p><b>Amount By Site:</b><br/>
This field should only be used for Single Site contracts OR if multiple 
 Sites do NOT need differing amounts specified by Site. If there are values 
 on the Site list the system does not allow entry into this field. When 
 this field is completed, it is used to generate the values on the Advanced 
 Billing tab when Auto Populate is clicked. Since this field itself is 
 not saved, the user will be reminded to Auto Populate when saving the 
 record if it is greater than zero but the sum of the Advanced Billed lines 
 is zero.</p>

 Renewing Multiple Tasks</font> <font style="font-weight: bold;">per Day 
 Contracts:</font><br/>
If multiple inspection tasks per day have been manually scheduled, this 
 function should NOT be used to Renew the Master Contract; the Renewal? 
 flag must be blank in this case. These contracts should be managed from 
 the Master Contract itself.</p>
<p><font style="font-weight: bold;">Amortize Revenue?<br/>
</font>If this field checked, the Amount Earned will be evenly distributed 
 by month when the Auto Populate button is clicked.</p>
<p>Schedule:</p>

<p style="margin-left: 36.00pt;"><font style="font-weight: bold;">Dec: Bill Earn Inspect</font></p>
<p>These fields enable you to select the months to Bill and realize Earnings 
 on the contract, and also which months that an inspection should be scheduled 
 for. The Adv. Bill and Schedule tabs will be updated when you click the 
 Auto Populate button.</p>
<p>If inspections should be spaced on even intervals (as discussed above), 
 no inspection boxes should be flagged.</p>

</font><font style="font-weight: bold;">5<br/>
</font>This grid enables you to select the day (or days) of the month that 
 the inspection should take place. This grid would typically only be used 
 if inspections take place every month.</p>
<p>For example, to specify an inspection for the 1st and 3rd Monday of 
 each month, the grid would be completed as follows:<br/>
Wks:  Mon:  Tue:  Wed:  Thu:  Fri:  Sat:  Sun:<br/>
1  X<br/>
2<br/>
3     X</p>
<p>When the Autofill button is clicked, the system will calculate the correct 
 date of each 1st and 3rd Monday, and use that information to add these 
 inspections to the Schedule tab.</p>
<p>The day of the month functionality may be used with the monthly inspection 
 functionality.</p>
<p>If the Inspect? Month fields are all blank, but one or more Day fields 
 are checked, inspections will be checked for all months (as defined in 
 the Days section) will be created when the Auto Populate button is clicked.</p>
<p>If only certain Inspect? Month fields are checked, and one or more Days 
 are checked, only those Days in the selected months will be added to the 
 Schedule when the Auto Populate button is clicked.</p>
<p>Note: if Days were selected, and Inspect? Months were all blank, all 
 of the Inspect? Months will be checked when the Master Contract record 
 is saved.</p>

</font>These fields enable you to select the default values that will be 
 used to populate the Schedule tab when you click the Auto Populate button; 
 this it true for both Monthly and Day of the Week inspections. These fields 
 override the registry setting sys-viewer-vmstrcntrct options (if they 
 exist) used to set the work code. If these fields are not completed, those 
 specified in the registry will be used.</p>

  The CSV button on the side toolbar of the Sites allows the user 
 to add lines from a .cvs file to a brand new Master Contract record. When 
 the .CSV button is pressed it verifies that the viewer is a New Record 
 and that no changes have been made to the record before presenting a file 
 selection dialog to access a provided CSV.  The .cvs file must 
 include a header row specifying the following columns that will define 
 the lines that will be added to the Master Contract&#39;s Sites column:</p>
<p style="margin-left: 48px;">Site Id<br/>
Job Id<br/>
Job Cost Code Id<br/>

<p style="margin-left: 48px;"><span>All of the Id lines must specify valid 
 record Id&#39;s. the Values and Hours columns must be numeric. If any value 
 for a new line is considered invalid, that line is skipped and after all 
 lines have been processed the user will be presented with a text box containing 
 a list of the errors and the error.log file will also contain the errors. 
 Once the Site lines have been added, complete the Master Contract and 
 be sure to save it. </span></p>
<p><font style="font-weight: bold;">Site Id:<br/>
</font>The Client Site Id. You may enter Sites on this list by entering 
 their Site Id, or by double-clicking on this field to bring up a list 
 of Sites. The Filter tab (discussed above) may also be used to add multiple 
 Sites to the list.</p>
<p style="margin-left: 8px;">Validation prevents adding the same Site multiple 
 times. The Line Insert w/Copy action clears the Site Id to prevent 
 accidental duplication of Site Ids. Adding a new Site Id adds all active 
 Client Site Equipment records for the Site to the new Equipment tab.  Each 
 newly added Equipment record defaults to not Covered.</p>
<p style="margin-left: 8px;">Removing or changing a Site now has validation 
 that prevents its removal if the Site or any of its CSE records have <b><i>posted</i></b> 
 references to the MC.  These references might exist on either 
 the CS-PMBilling or the CSE-PMSchedule child tabs.  When <b><i>posted</i></b> 
 MC references exist, the Site cannot be removed but the individual CSE 
 records can still be set to NOT Covered on the new MSE child.  See 
 below for definitions of <b><i>posted</i></b>. Note: similar validation 
 and messaging occurs if an attempt is made to delete a child row that 
 violates the above.</p>

<p style="margin-left: 8px; font-weight: bold;">Cost Category:<br/>
<span style="font-weight: normal;">In some States certain Preventive Maintenances 
 are taxable while others are not taxable. When Create PM Billings is run, 
 the system passes the Job Cost Category (if specified) from the Master 
 Contract to the corresponding new field in the Client Site PM Billing 
 schedule.  If completed, this field overrides the default Cost Category 
 derived from the sys-start-scrtepmbllng registry&#39;s Cost Category 
 option. This allows the user to make the Billing taxable or non-taxable 
 as needed by the selection of an appropriate Cost Category.</span></p>
<p style="margin-left: 8px; font-weight: bold;"><span style="font-weight: normal;">Master 
 Contract Time of Service Billings also be configured to produce a single 
 invoice with taxable and non-taxable components.  The same site should 
 appear twice on the Master Contract Site List, with a different Value 
 amount and Cost Category for each line (for example, if the PM is partially 
 taxable and partially non-taxable).  The Revenue written to the WO&#39;s 
 Other tab is correctly calculated according to the Value / Cost Category 
 on each Site List line, and appropriately handled as taxable/non taxable.</span></p>
<p style="margin-left: 8px;"><span>This field supports enhanced filtering 
 provided by the Cost Code&#39;s Job Cost Category Usage Filter. Cost Categories

 between all scheduled PM Work Orders. If multiple sites are included for 
 this Master Contract, a separate work order (each with the appropriate

<p>However, if the Schedule Hours as % field on the Main Tab is flagged, 
 the system will treat this field as a percentage field and calculate the 
 estimated hours as a percentage of the Total Site Hours on the Site List

<p style="margin-left: 72.00pt;">If this registry option is set to No, 
 AND the Technician is not a Sub, flagged Service Parts will not be used 
 to create quoted lines on the PM Work Order.</p>
<p style="margin-left: 72.00pt;">If this registry option is set to Sub, 
 AND the Technician is not a Sub, handle flagged Service Parts using the 
 subcontractor processing (that writes these parts to the Work Requested).</p>
<p style="margin-left: 72.00pt;">If this registry option is set to Yes 
 or is not present, use the default processing that flagged Service Parts 
 are used to create quoted lines on the PM Work Order.</p>
<p><font style="font-weight: bold;">Service Tasks Id:<br/>
</font>If a Service Task List is specified, it will be used on PM&#39;s for 
 all Equipment scheduled for from that line.</p>
<p>If the Service Task Id is blank, the system looks to see if there is 
 one specified in the Client Site Equipment. This Service Task will be 
 defaulted to the Client Site Equipment PM Schedule and then to the PM 
 Work Order itself. This enhancement allows for different Task Lists to 
 be assigned by the Equipment scheduled. </p>

 to View the Following Fields</p>
<p><font style="font-weight: bold;">Cycle Code Filter:</font><font style="font-weight: bold;"><br/>
</font>This filter is used by Sam Pro and TechAnywhere to filter PM Work 
 Order Log Form Metrics lists for the Equipment being maintained. Multiple 
 cycle codes may be entered as a comma-delimited list. Note that Log Form 
 field in the Client Site Equipment record determines which list of metrics 
 is used.</p>
<p>If this field is blank, the system will use the Cycle Code in the Work 
 Code instead for filtering. Only those metrics whose CC: field corresponds 
 to the filter or is blank will be written to the Work Order (for Techs 
 without remote access) or uploaded to the Technician’s device (for Technicians 
 with remote access). If the Cycle Code filter in both the Schedule and 
 Work Code are blank, all metrics from the Log Form will be written to 
 the Metrics tab.</p>
<p>If one or more Cycle Codes are listed, only those metrics whose CC: 
 field corresponds to this field or is blank will be written to the Work 
 Order (for Techs without remote access) or uploaded to the Technician’s 
 device.</p>
<p>The following fields enable you to specify a flat rate per visit (by 
 Site) for each active piece of equipment that is flagged as Under Contract. 
 They would be completed only if you wish to bill as the work is completed.</p>
<p><font style="font-weight: bold;">Revenue Per Visit:<br/>
</font> The Revenue Per Visit will be used to set the corresponding Cn 
 (Contract) Value field in the Client Site Equipment record. For billing 
 purposes, the Cn Value will be included on the Other tab of PM Work Orders 
 generated from this entry. This field is designed to generate a per work 
 order amount. If multiple pieces of equipment are under contract, the 
 Cn (Contract) Value field will only be set for one of them.</p>
<p style="margin-left: 48px;"><font style="font-weight: bold;">Note:</font> 
 if multiple pieces of equipment are to be covered under a single maintenance 
 work order, the same Technician Id should be referenced in the Main Tab 
 of all applicable Equipment records for this site. If this is not the 
 case, different pieces of equipment will appear on different work orders 
 assigned to different Techs.</p>
<p style="font-weight: bold;">Cost Per Visit:</p>
<p><span><u style="text-decoration: none; ">W</u>hen the UseMasterContractEquipmentTable 
 global registry is set to true, entry in the line’s Cost Per Visit field 
 is not allowed.  The message &quot;This database is configured 
 to use the Master Contract Equipment table. Use of this field is not permitted&quot; 
 will be displayed.</span></p>
<p>The Cost Per Visit will be used to set the corresponding Cn Cost field 
 in the Client Site Equipment PM Schedule. If a subcontractor technician 
 is specified in the Client Site Equipment Main tab, the system will automatically 
 generate a Purchase Order (in the amount of the Contract Cost). The PO 
 will be issued to the Vendor referenced in the Technician record.</p>
<p><font style="font-weight: bold;">Alternate Method for Specifying Revenue 
 and Cost:<br/>
</font>The Provider Rates Tab (discussed below) provides an alternative 
 method for assigning revenue and cost per visit.</p>
