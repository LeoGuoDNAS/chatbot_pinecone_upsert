  <h1>AR Cash Receipts Journal Viewer (Cash Receipts)</h1>
  <h2>Purpose:</h2>
  <p>This viewer records payment of receipts. It is divided into three sections. The upper section contains the basic transaction header information on the Main and GL tabs; you may need to scroll this section to view all fields. The middle section will display the transaction item detail for this entry. The bottom section contains the open invoice list for the selected client. This open invoice list is used to generate the transaction detail in the middle portion of the screen.</p>
  <h2>Usage:</h2>
  <p>
    <font style="font-weight: bold;">AR Deposits, Prepays and Retainers:</font><br/>
    Click <a href="AR_Deposits_Prepays_Retainers.htm">AR Deposits, Prepays, Retainers</a> for a step-by-step description of how to handle these items.
  </p>
  <p>See <a href="NSF_Check_Processing.htm">NSF Check Processing</a> for tips on handling bad checks.</p>
  <h3>Credit Card Processing</h3>
  <p>See <a href="AR_Cash_Receipts_APT_Processing.htm">OpenEdge / Global Payments Credit Card Processing</a> for details on processing a payment or refund via credit card if OpenEdge functionality is implemented for your company.</p>
  <p>See <a href="AR_Cash_Receipts_Electronic_Payment_Credit_Card_Processing.htm">Electronic Payments Credit Card Processing</a> for details on processing a customer payment if Electronic Payments functionality is implemented on your system.</p>
  <h3>Applying Overpayments to Original Invoice</h3>
  <p>If a customer pays the same invoice twice, a registry may be implemented to allow the user to &#39;clone&#39; the original Cash Receipt to create the overpayment entry. Click <a class="expandspot" data-rhwidget="ExpandSpot" data-target="POPUP675544785" href="#"><span data-open-text="true" data-skip-index="true">Cloning Cash Receipts</span><span data-close-text="true">Cloning Cash Receipts</span></a><span data-targetname="POPUP675544785" class="expandtext">Registry to Implement<br/>
      <span style="font-weight: bold;">Id:</span> sys-viewer-varrcptslst<br/>
      <span style="font-weight: bold;">Setting Key:</span> isOkToCloneRecord
       <span style="font-weight: bold;">Setting Value:</span> true  (default
      is false)<br/>
      Note that Cloning is NOT allowed if NewReversing is enabled in the AR Cash
      Receipts Journal.<br/>
      Procedure to &#39;Clone&#39; the Cash Receipt<br/>
      1. Access the original AR Cash Receipt you wish to copy.<br/>
      2. On the menu at the top of the viewer, select Record &gt; Clone Record.<br/>
      3. The system will copy the original receipt, clicking the Check Number
      and Credit Card fields.<br/>
      4. Change the Check Number,  Accounting Period, Effective Date and
      other fields as needed and Add the new record. AR History will show the
      additional payment to the specified invoice. </span> for details.</p>
  <p>Validation prevents the simultaneous use of the Cash Receipts and Bank Deposit journals. The user may be asked to refresh a screen or restart a transaction if needed.</p>
  <p style="margin-left: 36.00pt;">
    <font style="font-weight: bold;">Reset Totals</font>
    <font style="font-weight: bold;">:</font> The &#39;Reset Totals&#39; option of the Record menu forces the &#39;Receipts Entered&#39; and &#39;Discount Entered&#39; accumulators to match the content of the child lines. It may be used to get this journal back into sync if multiple insertions and deletions of lines resulted in the detail and header totals not matching.
  </p>
  <p>Changes (and applicable reversing entries) to receipts in inactive accounting periods will be written to the open accounting period and effective date that the user selects. Changes are not allowed if the receipt has been entered in the Bank Deposit Journal.</p>
  <p>In 9.1.611.060 and up, the following registry allows users to make field changes and delete child lines for saved records with processed payments. With the enabled registry, this allows the user to zero out the A/R child rows for &quot;incorrect&quot; invoices and insert the new rows with the &quot;correct&quot; invoices, so long as the total against the processed payment matches. <br/>
    <strong>Note: If the wrong amount was processed, the users must refund the CC transaction and reprocess it.</strong>
  </p>
  <p>Registry: sys-viewer-varrcptslst<br/>
    Setting Key: AllowChangeToProcessedReceipt    Setting Value: true<br/>
     </p>
  
  <h2>Range Viewer:</h2>
  <p>Since multiple GL accounts are present in the ‘parent’ table of this journal, range filters (where you simply enter the GL Account Id) do not work for these &quot;encapsulated&quot; fields. To filter on a specific parent GL Account, special filter ranges with the necessary SQL to filter on a specific GL Account have been added to the range filter. For example, when you first access the Range screen, the GL Bank Account range will be completed as follows:</p>
  <p style="margin-left: 36.00pt;">
    <font style="font-weight: bold;">GL Bank Account Id:</font><br/>
    sql= gl_bnk_glaccnt_rn in (select glaccnt_rn from glaccnt where glaccnt_id like &#39;%&#39;)
  </p>
  <p>Suppose that your firm uses more then one Bank Account. To filter Entries for a specific GL Bank Account, simply replace the % in the SQL statement with the GL Bank Account Id you wish to filter on. For example, to filter on the GL Bank Account Id 1005, simply change the SQL statement in the range to:</p>
  <p style="margin-left: 36.00pt;">sql= gl_bnk_glaccnt_rn in (select glaccnt_rn from glaccnt where glaccnt_id like &#39;<font style="font-weight: bold;">1005</font>&#39;)</p>
  <p style="margin-left: 36.00pt;">
    <font style="font-weight: bold; text-decoration: underline; ">Tip: Saving Ranges</font>
  </p>
  <p style="margin-left: 36.00pt;">Rather than adjust the SQL statement each time you use the filter, you may save your settings as a range. See <a href="Filter_Button.htm#Filter_Save_Range">Save Filter Range</a> for details.</p>
  <h2>Creating A Journal Entry: Non-consolidated Invoices</h2>
  <p>
    <font style="font-weight: bold;">Step 1.</font> Click the New button to clear the data-entry fields. Enter the Client Id in the upper section of the screen or double-click to select from a list of Client IDs. If you are not sure of the Client but know the Invoice number, go to Step 2a below.
  </p>
  <p>
    <font style="font-weight: bold;">Step 2.</font> Complete the Check Number, Total Discount and the Total Received fields for the payment you are processing.
  </p>
  <p style="font-weight: bold; margin-left: 48px;">Tip: Filtering the Open Invoices List<br/>
    If more than one invoice is included on the check, you may filter the Open Invoice list to make the selection of the Invoices more easily:</p>
  <p style="margin-left: 88px;">Right-click on the column title in the Open Invoices list that you wish to filter on.</p>
  <p style="margin-left: 88px;">When the Column Filter popup appears, enter an appropriate filter for the selected column and click OK to apply the filter.</p>
  <p style="margin-left: 88px;">More that one filter may be applied if needed. The Running Balance on the Open Invoice List is updated after column filters are applied to the list.</p>
  <p style="margin-left: 88px;">When Open Invoice list has been filtered to match the customer&#39;s payment, click the Auto-Fill Transactions button. Only the invoices in the filtered list will be selected.</p>
  <p style="margin-left: 36.00pt;">
    <font style="font-weight: bold;">Tip:</font>
    <font style="font-weight: bold;">Unapplied Cash Receipts / Deposits</font><br/>
    Cash received from a customer for an unknown (or not yet created) job or invoice may be logged in the Cash Receipts Journal by specifying the Client Id and then doing the following:
  </p>
  <p style="margin-left: 72.00pt;">Add a new AR tab line and Click its Magnify button<br/>
    Click the Unapplied Deposit button<br/>
    An input form will appear: complete the fields needed for the unapplied deposit</p>
  <p style="margin-left: 36.00pt;">When you save the AR Cash Receipts entry, the Invoice Number for the unapplied deposit will be generated by the system as UN######. The system will automatically make a credit invoice record that may be applied against a future invoice and will appear on the AR and Customer Statement reports.</p>
  <p style="margin-left: 36.00pt;">
    <font style="font-weight: bold;">Applying a Unapplied</font>
    <font style="font-weight: bold;">Receipt</font>
    <font style="font-weight: bold;">/Credit</font>
    <font style="font-weight: bold;">:</font> to apply all or part of unapplied receipt or credit, select it and the invoice(s) to apply it against in the middle pane. This release supports the partial use of unapplied receipts/credits by allowing the user to change the amount.
  </p>
  <p style="margin-left: 72.00pt;">
    <font style="font-weight: bold;">Important:</font> When changing the amount of an unapplied receipt/credit, the user must use the minus (hyphen) key to enter the desired negative value. The user will be warned if the amount of the unapplied receipt is greater than zero.
  </p>
  <p class="Tip_Note_Heading" style="margin-top: 4.00pt;">Step 2a (Alternate)</p>
  <p>Complete the Check Number, Total Discount and the Total Received fields for the payment you are processing.</p>
  <p><img alt="image\EnterInvoices_new.gif" border="0" height="28" src="assets/images/image/EnterInvoices_new.gif" title="image\EnterInvoices_new.gif" width="94"/></p>
  <p>Click the Enter Invoices button to display a screen for entering individual Invoice Id’s described in <a href="Cash_Receipts_Enter_Invoice_Number.htm">Cash Receipts - Enter Invoice Number</a> . This function is useful if the check has your Invoice # but not the Client ID: if you enter in one of the invoices being paid it will auto-fill the Client. Is it also useful if a payment received from a client with many outstanding invoices; you may easily specify the 5 of 50 outstanding invoices being paid. This function does <font style="text-decoration: underline; ">not</font> support Consolidated Invoices.</p>
  <p class="Tip_Note_Heading" style="margin-top: 4.00pt;">If you have used this option, skip ahead to step 4.</p>
  <p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"> </p>
  <p>
    <font style="font-weight: bold;">Step 3.</font> When the Client is selected, a list of outstanding invoices appears in the bottom section of the screen: these may have been generated by COP, PM Contract or Job Invoices, or by manually recording a transaction in the AR Sales journal. You have two ways to select which invoices to apply to this receipt:
  </p>
  <p style="margin-left: 36.00pt;">
    <font style="font-weight: bold;">Option A:</font> Click the Auto Fill button to include all open invoices (in the bottom section) The system will generate the detail for this entry in the middle of the screen.
  </p>
  <p style="margin-left: 36.00pt;">
    <font style="font-weight: bold;">Option B:</font> To select a specific invoice, double-click on it in the open invoice (bottom section) to add it to the detail in the middle section. If more than one invoice is being paid with a single check, double-click on any additional open invoices included in the payment.
  </p>
  <p style="margin-left: 72.00pt;">
    <font style="font-weight: bold;">Tip:</font> If you select an open invoice, delete it, and attempt to add it again, the system informs you that the line has already been added. Simply exit the viewer and start again.
  </p>
  <p>
    <font style="font-weight: bold;">Step 4.</font> Allocate the discount, if any.
  </p>
  <p><img alt="image\ApplyDiscount.gif" border="0" height="28" src="assets/images/image/ApplyDiscount.gif" title="image\ApplyDiscount.gif" width="94"/><br/>
    The Apply Discount button allows the Discount fields of the selected invoices will be computed based on the Total Discount entered.</p>
  <p style="margin-left: 36.00pt;">
    <font style="font-weight: bold;">Tip</font>
    <font style="font-weight: bold;">: Pro Rate</font><br/>
    When this field is flagged, the Discount fields of the selected invoices will be automatically be updated as you click on new invoices to select them. Note that the Invoice Amount and Discount fields must be completed for correct operation.
  </p>
  <p>
    <font style="font-weight: bold;">Step 5.</font> When all desired invoices for this entry have been added to the middle portion of the screen, complete the remaining entry fields as described in Important Fields, below. Click the Add Record button to save the entry.
  </p>
  <h2><a id="Entering_a_Consolidated_Invoice"></a> Entering a Consolidated Invoice</h2>
  <p>The AR Cash Receipts Journal supports Consolidated Invoice functionality. To record receipt of a Consolidated Invoice (see <a href="Consolidated_Invoice_Viewer.htm">Consolidated Invoice Viewer</a>), complete the following steps.</p>
  <p>
    <font style="font-weight: bold;">Step 1.</font> Beginning with a blank Cash Receipts entry screen (do not complete the Client Id), click the Auto Fill Transactions button.
  </p>
  <p>
    <font style="font-weight: bold;">Step 2.</font> When the box entitled ‘Auto-Fill Receipts Entry from List of Invoices’ appears, type in the Consolidated Invoice Id and then click OK. Note that all eligible items on the Consolidated Invoice have been selected, and appear in the center of the screen.
  </p>
  <p>
    <font style="font-weight: bold;">Step 3.</font> Complete the remaining fields in the AR Cash Receipts Journal, and click the Add button.
  </p>

It specifies the GL Account to which currency conversion adjustments (if any) will be posted when GL history is written.

  <p>This detail may be generated by double-clicking on entries in the Open Invoice list in the lower section of the screen, by clicking the Auto-Fill button to import all open invoices for this Client, or via the Enter Invoices button.</p>
  <p>In this release, the only editable fields are the Invoice Amount and Discount Taken, and the Description (click the Magnify button to access). The Unapplied Deposit button on the Detail view may be used to enter the unapplied deposits, as described below.</p>
  <p>
    <font style="font-weight: bold;">Invoice Id:</font><br/>
    The invoice being paid. If more than one Job Cost Code or Billing item was included on this invoice, more than one line of detail will appear for this invoice.
  </p>
  <p>
    <font style="font-weight: bold;">Amount:</font><br/>
    The dollar amount to be applied to this line.
  </p>
  <p>
    <font style="font-weight: bold;">GL Account</font><br/>
    The AR Control account to be credited.
  </p>
  <p>
    <font style="font-weight: bold;">GL Entity:</font><br/>

  </p>
  <p>
    <font style="font-weight: bold;">Discount Taken:</font><br/>

  </p>
  <p>
    <font style="font-weight: bold;">Job Id: Job Cost Code Id: Job Billing Item Id: Job Cost Category:</font><br/>
    These fields default from the Invoice record if this payment is associated with a specific Job record.
  </p>
  <p>Note that the Cost Category field supports enhanced filtering provided by the Cost Code&#39;s Job Cost Category Usage Filter. Cost Categories are validated (relative to Cost Codes) during data entry upon leaving the Cost Category Id field.  The full relationship is validated again when leaving a child line or saving a record.</p>
  <p><img alt="" border="0" src="assets/images/image/Magnify.gif" style="border: none;"/> Click the Magnify button to display the following fields;</p>
  <p>
    <font style="font-weight: bold;">Description:</font><br/>
    This optional field briefly describes this line.

  <p>
    <font style="font-weight: bold;">Client/Customer Id and Name:</font><br/>

  <p><img alt="image\UnappliedDeposit.gif" border="0" height="28" src="assets/images/image/UnappliedDeposit.gif" title="image\UnappliedDeposit.gif" width="94"/></p>
  <p>Cash received from a customer for an unknown (or not yet created) job or invoice may be logged by clicking the Unapplied Deposit button. An input form will appear: complete the fields needed for the unapplied deposit.</p>
  <p>If the unapplied deposit is for an overpayment of an existing invoice, fill out the Description indicating the Invoice that the overpayment was made to; this will be displayed in AR Cash Receipts Journal&#39;s Invoice Description column.</p>
  <p>When you save the AR Cash Receipts entry, the Invoice Number for the unapplied deposit will be generated by the system as UN######. The system will automatically make a credit invoice record that may be applied against a future invoice and will appear on the AR and Customer Statement reports.</p>
  <p>The Invoice master record created from this entry will have its Effective Date defaulted from the Cash Receipt&#39;s Effective Date. The Entry Type will be set to Credit Memo (was previously set to Unknown in earlier releases) and its Status set to Posted (it was previously set to New).</p>

	 border-right: 1.50pt solid #000000;">Other Tab</p>
  <p>This tab should only be used to record a cash receipt where only a partial amount of the check applies to your company’s invoices. To do so, select the applicable Invoices (which will then appear on the AR tab), and then record the remaining balance on the &quot;Other&quot; tab to another account(s). This will allow your deposits and bank reconciliations to be accurate. <font style="font-weight: bold;">Note that transactions recorded on the Other tab will be recorded to GL history only; not AR History.</font> See <a href="Registry_AR_Cash_Receipts.htm">Registry AR Cash Receipts</a> for a registry entry to eliminate this tab if it should never be used.</p>
  <p style="margin-left: 48px;"><span style="font-weight: bold;">Tip:</span> Editing  a Cash Receipts Entry with Other Line(s)<br/>
    If you need to edit/delete an existing AR Cash Receipt Entry, ALWAYS  edit/delete the AR tab lines before you edit/delete the Other tab lines. Implementing your changes in this order will allow your modified entry to be saved without error.</p>
  <p>
    <font style="font-weight: bold;">Amount:</font><br/>
    The excess Amount received that is NOT being applied to invoices on the AR tab.
  </p>
  <p>
    <font style="font-weight: bold;">GL Account:</font><br/>
    The account for the excess. For example, this could be the liability account being credited. Validation will prevent the use of AR Control GL Accounts on the Other tab. This validation will prevent issues with AR and GL not matching if, for example, an entry was made on the Other tab to record over-receipt against an invoice that could be left &#39;on account&#39;.<span style="font-weight: bold;"> </span>
  </p>
  <p>
    <font style="font-weight: bold;">GL Entity:</font><br/>
    The Entity being charged with the excess amount.
  </p>
  <p>
    <font style="font-weight: bold;">Description:</font><br/>
