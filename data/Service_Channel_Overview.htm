<h1>Service Channel Overview</h1>
<h3>Introduction</h3>
<p>The ServiceChannel FMMS Data Bridge provides an automated interface 
 between Sampro and ServiceChannel’s FMMS web site. The Data Bridge provides 
 the following services:<br/>
</p>
<p>Transference of service requests entered on the ServiceChannel web site 
 into the service provider’s Sampro system.</p>
<p>The ability of SAMPro service dispatchers to accept or decline incoming 
 service requests.</p>
<p>The attaching of accepted service requests to Sampro work orders.</p>
<p>The ability of uploading Proposals to ServiceChannel from Quote Master.</p>
<p>The posting of Check-In and Check-Out messages received from ServiceChannel 
 to work orders.</p>
<p>The forwarding to ServiceChannel of changes to a work order’s status.</p>
<p>The forwarding to ServiceChannel of changes to a work order’s ETA.</p>
<p>Uploading invoices to ServiceChannel when they are generated in Sampro.</p>
<h3>Registry Configuration Settings</h3>
<p>See <a href="Registry_Service_Channel_sys_FMMS_.htm">Registry Service 
 Channel (sys-FMMS)</a> for the registry settings required to support the 
 Service Channel data bridge.</p>
<p>Note that it will be necessary to obtain a vrstry.cus file with the 
 FMMS option enable to support the Data Bridge.</p>
<h3>Operational Scenario</h3>
<p>From a Sampro user’s point of view, Sampro/ServiceChannel interactions 
 go as follows:<br/>
</p>
<p style="margin-left: 48px;">- The service requester logs into ServiceChannel’s 
 web site and initiates a service request.</p>
<p style="margin-left: 48px;">- ServiceChannel forward’s the service request 
 to the service provider’s SAMPro system where it appears in the ‘Web Log’.</p>
<p style="margin-left: 48px;">- Within SAMPro’s New Call function, the 
 dispatcher or other user double clicks on the Web Log Id field. A list 
 of unacknowledged service requests will appear.</p>
<p style="margin-left: 48px;">- When the dispatcher picks a new service 
 request from the list, a window showing details of the service request 
 pops up. An example appears in the Appendix to this document.</p>
<p style="margin-left: 48px;">- After reviewing the service request, the 
 dispatcher selects one of three buttons appearing at the bottom of the 
 window:</p>
<p style="margin-left: 88px;"> Cancel – Returns to New Call. The service 
 requests stays on the Web Log list.</p>
<p style="margin-left: 88px;">Decline – The dispatcher is asked to choose 
 from a list of permissible reason codes. After a reason code is selected, 
 ServiceChannel is notified that the service request has been declined 
 and the service request is removed from the Web Log list.</p>
<p style="margin-left: 88px;">Accept – The service request screen is closed 
 and the New Call process continues with certain fields automatically populated 
 with information gleaned from the service request. If and when New Call 
 results in the creation of a new Sampro work order,</p>
<p style="margin-left: 48px;">- A Note containing the contents of the service 
 request is attached to the work order.</p>
<p style="margin-left: 48px;">- The service request is removed from the 
 Web Log list.</p>
<p style="margin-left: 48px;">- If the service requestor requires a proposal 
 before commencing work, the user can create a Sampro Quote and upload 
 it to ServiceChannel as a Proposal. The Proposal can include previously 
 incurred charges.</p>
<p style="margin-left: 48px;">- As technicians use ServiceChannel’s IVR 
 system to check-in and check-out of work orders, the Data Bridge automatically 
 updates the work orders accordingly.</p>
<p style="margin-left: 48px;">- Sampro tracks the work order as it changes 
 status and ETAs. Service Channel is automatically notified when either 
 of these changes takes place.</p>
<p style="margin-left: 48px;">- When the work order is invoiced, a spreadsheet 
 containing invoice details is assembled and emailed to ServiceChannel. 
 The Invoice Date uploaded to Service Channel now includes the time using 
 the format &#39;mm/dd/yyyy hh:mm&#39; where the hh:mm represents the current time.</p>
<h3>Reverse Posted Invoices</h3>
<p>When ServiceChannel work order are 
 billed, the invoice is automatically uploaded to ServiceChannel. This 
 release supports the automatic resending of the re-invoiced invoice. Specifically, 
 when an Invoice Master is marked as &#39;Reversed&#39;, any FMMSInfo records meeting 
 the following requirements are located:</p>
<p style="margin-left: 48px;">The FMMSInfo 
 record&#39;s wrkordr_rn field matches the reversed Invoice Master&#39;s srvceinvce_wrkordr_rn 
 field.</p>
<p style="margin-left: 48px;">The FMMSInfo 
 record has it&#39;s fmmsinfo_invce_qd column set to &quot;Y&quot;.</p>
<p style="margin-left: 8px;">IF any such 
 FMMSInfo records are found, their fmmsinfo_invce_qd column is reset to 
 &#39;N&#39;.</p>

<p>ServiceChannel Upload<br/>
The &#39;ServiceChannel Upload&#39; button will appear on the Document Viewer&#39;s 
 list and record screens if the Work Order is integrated with ServiceChannel. 
 Pressing this button from the Document list will give a checklist of all 
 attachments to allow the user to select multiple attachments to send at 
 once. Pressing from the Document record will upload that single attachment. 
 The attachment(s) will be emailed to ServiceChannel where they will be 
 processed at a set interval and attached to the ServiceChannel system.</p>
<p>In Version 9.1, the ServiceChannel 
 document upload uses the document from the Archive File Location in preference 
 to the File Location. This change was made because the Archive File Location 
 is more form stable and accessible to the function since the File Location 
 might be a different user&#39;s PC. </p>
