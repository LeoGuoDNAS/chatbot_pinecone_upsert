 <P class="Style_Support_+_Left___0_5_" >This case also changes the way in which ‘Active’ users of specific type are counted. Previously, then counting active users for licensing purposes, the system only looked at users whose ‘Disabled’ field was clear (set to No). In this release, active users are those whose Disabled field is clear AND whose Password Expiration Date is either blank (1900-01-01) or set to a future date.

 <P class="support" >When a Site is selected in New Call, the system attempts to determine which Client it is associated with in order to check the AR Balance and Aging either of the client or of a specific site associated with the client (if the registry option EnableNewCallClientSiteARAnalysis=true is enabled). The following is done to derive the Client:</P>
 <P class="support" >1. First, look at the Default Service Job in the Equipment record for that Site that has the lowest Rn (generally, the first Equipment that was created for the Site). If the Job is specified, check its Client.</P>
 <P class="support" >2. If the Equipment record with the lowest Rn has no Default Service Job, the system will check the Client Site record’s Client field (on the COP tab), and use that Client for the AR analysis.</P>
 <P class="support" >3. If the system cannot derive the Client using either of the above methods, AR / Credit Checking will be postponed until a piece of Equipment is selected. The system will then check that piece of Equipment’s default Service Job to derive the Client.</P>
 <P class="support" >4. If the selected Equipment has no Default Service Job, Credit / AR Balance checking will finally be initiated when the user selects a Job in New Call. </P>

 <P class="support" >Important Note: Custom Field Limitations</P>
 <P class="support" >Case 2266 introduced a simple method of relabeling fields and specifying defined values for text fields. However, there are two things to be aware of regarding the re-labeling:</P>
 <P class="support" >1. The new re-labeling functionality is not really field specific.&nbsp; That is due to the limitations of the old technology, because the&nbsp;new Custom Field Label actually uses the old Label Remapping technology at run time to decide how to alias the labels.&nbsp; As with the old technology, if you change 'Quantity' to 'Qty/Comm%', you are changing the label everywhere - parent and child viewers. In other words, fields with 'common' labels should not be re-labeled with either the new or the old technology.</P>
 <P class="support" >2. Label lengths are restricted when child table views are involved.&nbsp; Again, this is old technology and cannot be changed.&nbsp; In your example, if you had changed the label to 'Qty/Comm%:', the added would make the label to big to fit in the alloted space for the child heading.&nbsp; Most likely, the custom label would get truncated in that case.</P>

 <P class="Support" >2346&nbsp;Work Order Viewer: warn user if WO is assigned to a TechAnywhere or SubAnywhere Tech</P>
 <P class="Support" style="margin-left:36.00pt;">When a record is loaded into the Work Order viewer, the software will check if any uncompleted Techician lines are assigned to a TechAnywhere or SubAnywhere technician. Specifically, it will check the log type = 'Unacknowledged', 'OnSite', 'Travel', 'On Break', 'Waiting Parts', 'Parts Ordered', 'Scheduled', 'Waiting Service' and 'Quote Approved'.

 <P class="Support" >2416&nbsp;Launching External Commands – upper and lower filename extentions</P>
 <P class="Support" style="margin-left:36.00pt;">SAMPRO registry settings generally consist of key-value pairs separated by an equal sign.&nbsp; When SAMPRO retrieves the key-value pairs, the key portion is always converted to lowercase and the value portion is retained in its original format.&nbsp;For example,  the key-value pair 'seen' by SAMPRO in &quot;jpg=C:\WINDOWS\System32\mspaint.exe&quot;.would present a problem in the Smalltalk code if a request was made for the registry setting for &quot;JPG&quot; since it would not 'exist' in the eyes of SAMPRO.

 <P class="Support" style="margin-left:36.00pt;">Branch Processing has been revised in New Call so that it now works as follows:</P>
 <P class="Support" style="margin-left:36.00pt;">1. When a Site is selected, all Branch info (Id, Rn, Name, etc) is set based on the Site's branch.</P>
 <P class="Support" style="margin-left:36.00pt;">2. When Equipment is selected, all Branch info is set based on the associated Job's branch unless any one of the following is true:</P>
 <P class="Support" style="margin-left:72.00pt;text-indent:4.50pt;">- the Job does not have a Branch specified<BR>&nbsp; - the registry setting UseSiteBranch=true is set in sys-newcall <BR>&nbsp; - the registry setting BranchOverrideFrom=clntste is set in sys-ffv-global-settings</P>
 <P class="Support" style="margin-left:36.00pt;">The Branch assigned to the newly created work order should match what the user sees on the New Call entry form.</P>
 <P class="Support" style="margin-left:36.00pt;">Note that if BranchOverrideFrom=job is set in sys-ffv-global-settings, the Job’s Branch is always used, and there is no fallback to the Branch in the User’s account. </P>
 <P class="Support" style="margin-left:36.00pt;">If the above registry overrides are not present, the Branch from the User’s account will default if the Site and Job do not specify a Branch. In this case, the User may change or clear the Branch Id as allowed by his branch filtering/security. </P>

 <P class="Support" >2324&nbsp;Techanywhere Import / Export Message - Remove Single Quote </P>
 <P class="Support" style="margin-left:36.00pt;">The export and import buttons on the message viewer give support the ability to quickly fix messages that have bad data that keep the messages from posting. If a technician used an apostrophe in the work performed or any other open text field (recommendations, other rate description, etc) the export process in SAMPro would use single quotes to parse the message to export. Then during the import the data would now have an extra field due to the extra quote. Therefore, during the export process the single quotes are now replaced by a bar &quot;|&quot; and then changed back to a single quote during the import process. This allows all data to be retained by still using single quotes.  Please note that the export and import processes are only available in development mode. </P>

 <P class="Support" style="margin-left:36.00pt;">In this release, validation has been added to prevent the use from the user from transfering more than 1 of a serial number from a job into a location.

When you saved the WO, the system will simply decreased the quantity on hand by one. This could result in a negative count at one location, and multiple instances of the same serial number on more than one work order. </P>
 <P class="Support" style="margin-left:36.00pt;">Validation has been added so that the system does not allow you to enter/select a serial number on the WO Inventory tab unless it exists that the selected location (on the line) as a positive on hand quantity.</P>

 <P class="Support" style="margin-left:36.00pt;">The user should experience no behavior changes relative to the use of branches without the new registry setting.&nbsp; The only noticeable difference would be that several record viewers include a new 'ByBranchId' sort option.</P>
 <P class="Support" style="margin-left:36.00pt;">Implementing the new registry setting causes Branch Filtering to behave similarly to Security Filtering: even if the user clears the Branch Id range, only those Branches that match his or her Branch filter (in the User record) will appear. One significant difference is that a blank Branch Id is not treated as global record.</P>

We may have finally pinned down the problem. Occasionally, the DIB class issues a 'collection out of bounds' error: the reported explanation is 'the problem is that VS is expecting the bitmap’s palette always to contain a full 256 entries and tries to read beyond the end of the stream if it doesn’t.'  This problem has been corrected. </P>

 <P class="Support" style="margin-left:36.00pt;">The existing security model allows global users to change records originally created by non-global users.&nbsp; When this occurs in parent/child viewers, the parent retains its original Security Rn but any new rows (child and history records) adopt the user's Security Rn.&nbsp; In this scenario they become globally accessible.&nbsp; This was particularly a problem for reporting that runs from the resulting history entries. Code has been added that causes the lower-level row inserts to use the parent record's Security Rn instead of the user's.  In addition, journal-type viewers that create new -XX versions of existing transactions now retain the Security Rn of the originating entry.</P>

 <P class="Support" style="margin-left:36.00pt;">This build corrects an error in previous images. Software now works as follows:</P>
 <P class="Support" style="margin-left:36.00pt;">In previous versions, the TechAnywhere Event Manager’s status change SQL was prone to 'failure' when either the Scheduled Date or Original Status had been changed on the server-side (SAM Pro) but not on the client-side (TechAnywhere).&nbsp; The 'failure' doesn't involve a programming error or an SQL error.&nbsp; Although the update statement executed successfully, it didn’t find any rows that qualify for the update because, for example, the dispatcher had accidentally updated the status of a TechAnywhere work order.</P>
 <P class="Support" style="margin-left:36.00pt;">The TechAnywhere client now overrides the status changes on a work order if the work order was dispatched to the technician (and the dispatcher hasn't changed the status to cancelled). For example a TechAnywhere tech receives a work order and changes the status to onsite. Now, the dispatcher accidentally changes the status to travel. At this point, SAM Pro and TechAnywhere softwares are out of sync and the posting from TechAnywhere would fail. </P>
 <P class="Support" style="margin-left:36.00pt;">With this enhancement, when the tech goes to set the work order to complete (or another status) the technician's status now overrides the status that the dispatcher set in SAM Pro and re-synchronizes the two softwares.

 <P class="Support" style="margin-left:36.00pt;">The background on thisis that some of our customer are displaying the Classic Dispatch board on VERY LARGE (52&quot; are planned) flat panel monitors in the dispatch room for quick and easy review by service managers, techs, and so on.&nbsp; The problem with this scenario is that the displayed board does not refresh unless someone does something or manually hits refresh.</P>
 <P class="Support" style="margin-left:36.00pt;">A new autoRefresh toggle button has been added to the lower portion of Top Bar of the Dispatchboard.  You must scroll the Dispatch Board’s Top Button bar down to access the button!  This button should only be toggle on if the Dispatch Board is being displayed for view by non-users. If a regular user toggles this feature on, the Dispatch Board will redisplay with focus, regardless of what the user is trying to do. </P>
 <P class="Support" style="margin-left:36.00pt;">When the Dispatchboard is opened the toggle is set to off.<BR>Pressing the button sets the toggle on or off.<BR>When autoRefresh is on the Dispatchboard will refresh itself every timer duration (see below).</P>

PM Work Order Invoices generated for Credit Hold sites are not placed on Credit Hold and may be billed. </P>
 <P class="Support" style="margin-left:36.00pt;">This case also impacts the way in which Client Site Equipment PM Schedule and Client Site PM Billing lines generated from the Master Contract record are handled.

 <P class="Support" style="margin-left:36.00pt;">The change to allow the login to continue forced the addition of code that makes the terminated session 'more terminated' than in previous versions.&nbsp; Prior to this latest change, if the 'old' active session was really still active, the user would be allowed to finish adding or changing a record.&nbsp; With the latest changes, the terminated session is not allowed to continue.</P>

 <P class="Support_Heading_2" >Usage:</P>
 <P class="Support" >Great care must be taken in implementing this feature.</P>
 <P class="Support" >If a Custom Memory Table is implemented for a specific list, you MUST create a Customer Memory Table record for each value that you wish to appear in the list. </P>
 <P class="Support" >Be sure that all values that are required for system functionality are included as Custom Memory Table records. For example, if you are implementing records for the work order log type, you must include records with specific system meanings such as waiting service, invoice ready, unacknowledged, etc. </P>
 <P class="Support" >One viewer that has yet to be addressed is the Dispatch Board.&nbsp; Currently, this implementation would not prevent a user from setting an invalid WO Tech Status by pushing one of the existing sidebar buttons whose associated status is not in the customized values list.&nbsp; Please advise of any other issues that I'm forgetting.<BR>In other viewers, both the double-click and field validation code is aware of the custom Id values.</P>
