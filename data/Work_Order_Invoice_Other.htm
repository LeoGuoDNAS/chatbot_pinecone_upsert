<h1>Work Order Other Tab</h1>
<h2>Purpose:</h2>
<p>Specifies the quantity, rate, and type of other miscellaneous and non-inventory 
 material charges applied to this work order.</p>
<h2>Example:</h2>
<p>2 days rental for a backhoe, electrical supplies purchased at a local 
 hardware store, mileage charges, trip charges, etc.</p>
<h2>Usage:</h2>
<p>Trip and other additional charges may be automatically defaulted into 
 this tab for work orders created in New Call. These charges (if any) are 
 pulled from the WO Other tab of the Client Site Viewer.</p>
<p>Insert Line with Copy is enabled for all lines except the following: 
 Insert-with-copy IS disabled when the line being copied references a closed 
 Accounting Period that has the WO-Other-to-GL option turned on.</p>

<p><font style="font-weight: bold;">Quote Box Validation:</font></p>
<p>This validation applies to lines that are <font style="text-decoration: underline; ">not</font> 
 associated with a Quote: it prevents an &#39;actual&#39; line (that has already 
 been saved into the database) from being switched to a Quote-type line. 
 Note that the Quote box of Work Orders associated with a Quote still cannot 
 be changed at all.</p>
<h2>Important Fields:</h2>
<p><img src="assets/images/image/Magnify.gif" alt="" style="border: none;" border="0"/> 
 Double-click the Magnify button to display all fields for this line.</p>
<p class="Reference_Line" style="margin-bottom: 0.00pt;"><img src="assets/images/image/LinesView.gif" alt="" style="border: none;" border="0"/>  Click the Lines View 
 button to display the multiple line view again.</p>
<p><font style="font-weight: bold;">Qu (Quote?)<br/>
</font>If this line represents an estimate for work you are quoting a customer, 
 check this box by double-clicking it (or press the spacebar when the caret 
 is on it). If the quote is approved, the system will ultimately use the 
 Quote lines to generate billable revenue and budgeted costs. When you 
 check the Quote box, the Extra box will automatically be flagged.</p>
<p>As the work for this quote is completed, the actual quantities should 
 be recorded on lines that are <font style="font-weight: bold;">not</font> 
 flagged as Quotes: these costs will be written to Job History. Billable 
 revenue should only be included on these lines if it represents additional 
 billable dollars not included in the original quote.</p>
<p>Flag the Work Order as Invoice Ready when it has been approved and you 
 are ready to bill it.</p>
<p style="margin-left: 36.00pt;"><font style="font-weight: bold;">PM Work 
 Orders – JCH Budgets<br/>
</font>This <a href="Registry_Entry_to_Warn_if_Cost_Code_Requires_Certified_PR_Reporting.htm#registry_workorder_disable_budget_posting">registry 
 option</a> will disable the posting of job history of budget cost and 
 budget revenue for Preventive Maintenance work orders where the work order 
 lines are marked QU.</p>
<p><font style="font-weight: bold;">Effective Date:</font><br/>
This field is required in order for the system to access the Rate Schedule 
 correctly. Generally, you would enter the date on which the material was 
 used or the charge incurred. Use the <font style="font-style: italic;">MMDDYY</font> 
 format to enter the date from the keyboard or double-click on this field 
 (or press Alt+F7) to access the Calendar viewer to do so. Press Spacebar 
 to enter today&#39;s date.</p>
<p style="margin-left: 48px;"><span style="font-weight: bold;">Lines 
 from Quote Master:</span> When the Work Order is set to Invoice Ready 
 and saved, the Effective Date of Quoted lines and Revenue Adjustments 
 from Quote Manager will be updated to the Work Order Date Work Completed 
 (if set). In previous releases, the Effective Date of these lines was 
 set to the origination date of the Quote. Since this date could be months 
 in the past, revenue was recognized way too early through the Job EOM 
 function. See <a href="Quoted_and_Rev_Adjustment_Line_Dates.htm">Quote 
 and Rev Adjust Lines</a> for details.</p>
<p><font style="font-weight: bold;">Quantity: Qty Billed:<br/>
</font>The Quantity (Actually Used) and Billable Quantities may be specified 
 separately. The Quantity Used will be used for costing, and the Quantity 
 Billed will be used to compute revenue for billing purposes. Note that 
 the Quantity Billed field defaults when you enter the Quantity Used, but 
 may be adjusted by the user if needed.</p>
<p><font style="font-weight: bold;">Unit Cost</font><br/>
The Unit Cost of this item/charge. For standard Other charges defined on 
 your system, this field will default when the Other Rate Id is filled 
 in. In the case of non-Inventory materials purchased for this job, you 
 would simply enter the cost per unit at which you obtained this part.</p>
<p><font style="font-weight: bold;">Amount Cost:</font><br/>
The Unit Cost X Quantity. The system will calculate this field for you.</p>
<p><font style="font-weight: bold;">Description:</font><br/>
This optional field may be used to enter a brief description of this item/charge.</p>
<p><font style="font-weight: bold;">Other Rate Id:</font><br/>
Enter a valid Other Rate Id or double-click on this field to select from 
 a list. The Description field defaults from the Other Rate record, but 
 may be modified by the user if desired.</p>
<p><font style="font-weight: bold;">Cost Category Id:</font><br/>
A valid Cost Category with the Cost Type set to Other, Material, Subcontract 
 or Equipment. When you double-click on this field, the 
 list will be filtered so that only those Job Cost Categories these Selection 
 Cost Types will be displayed. This field is required.</p>
<p style="margin-left: 36.00pt;"><font style="font-weight: bold;">Note:</font> 
 If edits are made to work order detail lines AFTER a change has been made 
 to the Posting Type of the Cost Category, updates to JCH will use the 
 <font style="text-decoration: underline; ">original Cost Type</font>.  For 
 example, if a cost type was changed from Material to Other, the changed 
 amounts continue to be classified as Other.</p>
<p style="margin-left: 8px;">This field 
 supports enhanced filtering provided by the Cost Code&#39;s Job Cost Category 
 Usage Filter. Cost Categories are validated (relative to Cost Codes) during 
 data entry upon leaving the Cost Category Id field.  The full relationship 
 is validated again when leaving a child line or saving a record.</p>
<p><font style="font-weight: bold;">Tax Type Id:</font><br/>
The appropriate Tax Type for this line: enter a valid Id or double-click 
 to select from a list.</p>
<p><font style="font-weight: bold;">Unit of Measure</font><br/>
This field defaults to each but may be changed by the user.</p>
<p><font style="font-weight: bold;">Flat Rate Id:</font><br/>
If this line was created by the system when a Flat Rate Category was imported, 
 this field will be filled in. It is either used to associate flat rates 
 with actual costs for reporting purposes, or to enter the revenue amount 
 to be billed.</p>
<p><font style="font-weight: bold;">Bill Type Id:  Revenue Rate:</font><br/>
These fields default from the Other Rate table specified on the Rate Schedule 
 Schedule&#39;s Other tab for Cost Categories of type Other. If a Cost Category 
 Type of Material is selected, the Material Markup table in the Rate Schedule 
 will be used instead. These fields may be adjusted if needed.</p>
<p style="margin-left: 36.00pt;">If the Bill Type Id is set to <font style="font-weight: bold;">Unit 
 Price</font>, the Revenue Rate will equal the Unit Price.</p>
<p style="margin-left: 48px;">If the default 
 markup methodology is in effect this field will be set to Unit Price because 
 the price calculation is the result of an aggregate calculation. If the 
 old markup methodology is in effect this field will be set to the applicable 
 value (margin, markup or multiplier).</p>
<p style="margin-left: 36.00pt;">If <font style="font-weight: bold;">Markup</font> 
 is selected, the Revenue Rate will default from the Markup table (specified 
 in the Rate Schedule for this Job). For example, a 120% markup applied 
 to an item costing $100 would generate a unit price of $220. A 30% markup 
 applied to an item costing $100 would generate a unit price of $130.</p>
<p style="margin-left: 36.00pt;"><font style="font-weight: bold;">Margin</font> 
 enables the user to set the desired profit margin ((Unit Price - Unit 
 Cost)/Unit Price)for this item in the Revenue Rate field.</p>
<p style="margin-left: 36.00pt;">If you select <font style="font-weight: bold;">Multiplier</font>, 
 the system will multiply the figure in Revenue Rate X Unit Cost to obtain 
 the Unit Price. For example, a multiplier of 1.2 applied to an item costing 
 $100 would yield a unit price of $120.</p>
<p style="margin-left: 36.00pt;">Select the Billing Type of <font style="font-weight: bold;">n/a</font> 
 if a special price has been agreed on for this customer. In this case, 
 you will leave the Revenue Rate field blank, and enter the Amnt Revenue 
 fields directly.</p>
<p style="margin-left: 36.00pt;"><font style="font-weight: bold;">Unit 
 Price:</font><br/>
The Unit Price is calculated based on the Unit Cost, Bill Type Id, and 
 Revenue Rate you have selected.</p>
<p><font style="font-weight: bold;">Amount Revenue:</font><br/>
The price that will appear on the invoice (Unit Price x Quantity). The 
 Extra box must be checked to complete this field if the Billing Item is 
 flagged as Fixed Fee / Allow Extra.</p>
<p><font style="font-weight: bold;">Job Id:</font><br/>
This field defaults from the Work Order main screen unless a registry entry 
 is in place to default it from the Equipment record’s Service Job.</p>
<p><font style="font-weight: bold;">Job Cost Code Id:</font><br/>
This field defaults from the Work Order main screen. Enter a Job Cost Code 
 Id created for the Job Id you selected. You may double-click on this field 
 to select from a list of Job Cost Codes.</p>
<p><font style="font-weight: bold;">Job Billing Item Id:</font><br/>
This field defaults from the Job Cost Code record. Enter a Job Billing 
 Item for the Job Id entered above. You may double-click on this field 
 to select from a list of Job Billing Items.</p>
<p><font style="font-weight: bold;">GL Entity Id:</font><br/>
This field defaults from the Job record but may be changed by the user. 
 It identifies the profit center to be charged with this item. You may 
 double-click to select from a list of Id&#39;s.When 
 Intercompany is enabled any changes to the line&#39;s GL Entity are validated 
 to ensure that the new GL Entity belongs to the same company as the Job.</p>
<p><font style="font-weight: bold;">Extra?</font><br/>
If this is an &quot;extra&quot; that can be billed for, check this box 
 by double-clicking or pressing the Spacebar. <font style="font-weight: bold;">Note 
 that this Box can only be checked if the Job Billing Item you selected 
 allows extras.</font> The Revenue Rate, Unit Price, and Amnt Revenue fields 
 will not be completed unless an Item is marked as an Extra. Items that 
 are not Extras will be used to calculate job costing and profitability, 
 but will not be invoiced for directly.</p>
<p><font style="font-weight: bold;">Equipment Id:</font><br/>
Enter the Equipment Id this miscellaneous material or other charge was 
 used on or double-click to select from a list. Note that only Equipment 
 Id&#39;s included on the Equipment tab will appear on the list.</p>
<p> <img src="assets/images/image/Magnify.gif" alt="image\Magnify.gif" title="image\Magnify.gif" width="18" height="18" border="0"/> <font style="font-weight: bold;">Click 
 the Magnify button to view</font> <font style="font-weight: bold;">the 
 following fields:</font></p>
<p><font style="font-weight: bold;">Asset Id:<br/>
</font>Enter the appropriate company equipment Asset Id if you wish to 
 charge it to this Work Order. The Other Rate Id (and the associated Cost 
 and Revenue fields) will default from the Asset record’s Operating Other 
 Rate field (if completed). An Asset must be flagged as Chargeable to be 
 entered in this fields.  Entering/Changing 
 an Asset Id also loads the Asset&#39;s Other Rate and populates the Description 
 field. Clearing the Asset Id does not auto-load or clear existing Other 
 Rates and related data.</p>
<p><font style="font-weight: bold;">o Operating o Idle<br/>
</font> This field controls whether the Operating Other Rate or Idle Other 
 rate will default from the asset record.</p>
<p><font style="font-weight: bold;">Posted toGLH:<br/>
</font>The system will flag this display-only field when a WO Other line 
 is posted to GL.</p>
<p><font style="font-weight: bold;">Period Id:<br/>
</font>This field will be completed by the system using the default Accounting 
 Period; however, it will only be used to write to GL History if the Accounting 
 Period has the WO Other to GL option flagged. The system will validate 
 that the Effective Date falls within the selected accounting period if 
 the Accounting Period’s WO Other to GL field is flagged.</p>
<p><font style="font-weight: bold;">GL Debit Id:<br/>
</font> This field will default from the Job Cost Category GL Expense field 
 and should reference a Cost of Sales account. However, it will ONLY be 
 used to write to GL History If the selected Accounting Period has the 
 WO Other to GL option flagged</p>
<p><font style="font-weight: bold;">GL Credit Id:<br/>
</font><span>This field will default from the Other Rate’s GL Credit Account. 
  </span>It will ONLY be used to write to GL History If the selected 
 Accounting Period has the WO Other to GL option flagged.</p>
<p style="font-weight: bold;">GL Credit 
 Entity: <br/>
<span style="font-weight: normal;">This field will default using the first 
 non-blank GL Entity Id from:</span> </p>
<p style="margin-left: 48px;">1.) Asset 
 Id&#39;s OH Job Cost Code GL Entity</p>
<p style="margin-left: 48px;">2.) Registry

 = true/enabled; but &quot;DefaultBalanceSheetEntity&quot; value is 
 not defined, blank or disabled....then Company Record Default GL Entity 
 behaves as a STAND-IN as value.</p>
<p><font style="font-weight: bold;">Imported From JCH:<br/>
