<h1>Report Stock Status</h1>
<h2>Purpose:</h2>
<p>The Stock Status Report should only be used to provide average costing 
 over all locations.</p>
<p>In order to be included in this report, the Inventory Item must have 
 at least one line completed on its Location tab.</p>
<p style="margin-left: 48px;"><span style="font-weight: bold;">IMPORTANT:</span> 
 The related Report Inventory Cost On-Hand (RINVCST.rpt) has been revised 
 as of 12/02/2014 to improve the printing of the Inventory Total lines. 
  This report should be used to display costing per location for the 
 method specified in the report.</p>
<h2>Registry:</h2>
<p>Enhance performance by implementing temp table functionality: <a href="Registry_Report_Inventory_Stock_Status.htm">Registry 
 Report Inventory Stock Status</a></p>
<h2>Important Fields:</h2>
<p><font style="font-weight: bold;">Report Options:</font><br/>
The Report Options selector pane controls how the report will be output. 
 Click <a href="Report_Options.htm">Report Options</a> to learn more.</p>
<p><font style="font-weight: bold;">Range Name:</font><br/>
Enter a unique, alphanumeric name to save and identify your customized 
 report Range. Ranges are defined by the contents of the ID field(s).</p>
<p style="margin-left: 36.00pt;"><font style="font-weight: bold;" color="#0000FF">Hint:</font> 
 You can create user-defined report ranges that are available to all users 
 with access to that report. To do so, the first character of the named 
 range should be an asterisk. Named ranges beginning with an asterisk will 
 appear on all users&#39; report ranges options so that they can be selected 
 (but not altered) by any user with access to that report. Only the user 
 that created the report range is allowed to alter it.</p>
<p><font style="font-weight: bold;">End Date:<br/>
</font>By default, the system uses today’s date as the End Date. If you 
 wish the run the report for an earlier date, the system will only use 
 inventory history entered on or before that date when compiling the report.</p>
<p><font style="font-weight: bold;">Print Summary Only:<br/>
</font>When this box is checked, only the summary sections of the report 
 (for Locations and Groups) will be printed.</p>
<p><font style="font-weight: bold;">Inventory Group Id:</font><br/>
If you only wish to print this report for a specific Inventory Group, enter 
 its Id or double-click to select from a list. Several Groups may be listed 
 by entering their Id&#39;s separated by commas.</p>
<p><font style="font-weight: bold;">Inventory Item Id:</font><br/>
If you only wish to print this report for a specific Inventory Id, enter 
 its Id or double-click to select from a list. Several Items may be listed 
 by entering their Id&#39;s separated by commas, or a range of Items can be 
 defined by the first and last items of the range separated by an underscore 
 (P1001_P2000). To list only those items whose Id begins with a certain 
 character or characters, use the percent sign: S12% would limit the report 
 to only those items whose Id begins with the characters S12.</p>
<p><font style="font-weight: bold;">Location Id:</font><br/>
To print this report for a specific location, enter its Id (or double-click 
 to select from a list). Several Locations can be specified by entering 
 their Id&#39;s separated by commas (1005,1007,1020).</p>
<p><font style="font-weight: bold;">Turns:</font> <font style="font-weight: bold;"><br/>
</font>If your firm uses the Start Compute Corporate Metrics functionality 
 to compute inventory turns, this field may be used to limit this report 
 to those items having a specific turns ratio range (e.g, 3_5), less than 
 a certain turns value (e.g, &lt;1) or greater than a certain turns value 
 (&gt;3). Recall that turns are computed as the total usage over the period 
 divided by the average on-hand quantity over that same period. By usage, 
 we mean the total quantity sold via client orders and work orders (version 
 7.1 and above), plus the total quantity used by shop orders.</p>
<p><font style="font-weight: bold;">Core</font><font style="font-weight: bold;">?</font><font style="font-weight: bold;"><br/>
</font>To only include Inventory Items flagged as Core in the Inventory 
 Item record, enter a Y in this field.</p>
<p><font style="font-weight: bold;">Stocked:<br/>
</font>By default, this range is set to Y so that only those Inventory 
 Items flagged as Stocked (in the Inventory Item record) will be included. 
 To include all Inventory items with, clear the field.</p>
<h2>Report Description:</h2>
<p>The report lists the Inventory Id and Name, Cost Method (Standard, Last 
 or Average), Turns, Unit Cost (according to the cost method), and Standard 
 Cost (if specified).</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: bold;">9.1 
 Enhancement:</span> In previous releases, the Report Stock Status excluded 
 entries for locations that have a zero on hand amount (imhstry_qntty_on_hnd 
 - imhstry_qntty_rcvd_jb). As an example, if 0 were on hand but 2 on order 
 for stock, it did not show on the report. In this release, if any of the 
 following columns that are on the report have values that could affect 
 the On Hand amount, then the Location should be shown: On-Hand, Allocated, 
 Cust BO, Shop BO, Reorder and On-Order. Note that this is a system report 
 and does not need to be installed in the system.</p>
<p>For each item, the following Location detail is provided:</p>
<p style="margin-left: 36.00pt;">Location Id<br/>
On-Hand<br/>
Allocated (for Shop Orders or Client Orders)<br/>
Customer BO (Backorder via COP)<br/>
Shop BO (Backordered via Shop Order)<br/>
Reorder (the Reorder Level on the Inventory Item)<br/>
On Order (via Purchase Orders)<br/>
Inventory Value by Cost Method (the value at each location: Unit Cost X 
 On-Hand)<br/>
Inventory Value @ Std. Cost (Standard Cost X On-Hand)</p>
<p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"> </p>
<p><font style="font-weight: bold;">Technical</font> <font style="font-weight: bold;">Note 
 on Calculation of Unit Cost:</font></p>
<p>The report passes the Inventory Item to generalized code (the same that 
 would be used elsewhere in SAMPRO to determine a unit cost) and receives 
 a Unit Cost that it then prints on the report using the generic heading 
 &#39;Unit Cost&#39;.  The rules shown below are used to determine the 
 Unit Cost for the report.<br/>
<br/>
Inventory Item cost method is &#39;Average&#39; ...<br/>
1. Analyze IMH to determine Average Unit Cost.<br/>
2. If not available from IMH, use Item&#39;s Standard Unit Cost.<br/>
3. If Standard Unit Cost not available from Item, use Last Unit Cost from 
 Item.  NOTE: this is a special field that ONLY contains reliable 
 results immediately following initial data conversion.<br/>
<br/>
Inventory Item cost method is &#39;Last&#39; ...<br/>
1. Analyze IMH to determine Last Unit Cost.<br/>
2. If not available from IMH, use Item&#39;s Standard Unit Cost.<br/>
3. If Standard Unit Cost not available from Item, use Last Unit Cost from 
 Item.  NOTE: this is a special field that ONLY contains reliable 
 results immediately following initial data conversion.<br/>
<br/>
Inventory Item cost method is &#39;Standard&#39; ...<br/>
