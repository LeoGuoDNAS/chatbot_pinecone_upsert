 <H2>Version 6.2 Customer Release Notes - Build 6.2.408.052</H2>
 <P class="Reference_Line" style="margin-bottom:0.00pt;"><A href="version_6_2_customer_release_notes.htm#6.2_Patches">Version 6.2 Recent Patches and Enhancements</A> </P>
 <H2>1 System</H2>
 <H2>1.0 IMPORTANT: Invoicing Reports for 1/19/2007 Images and Later</H2>
 <P>SERVICEINVOICE.RPT &amp; RININV4.RPT must be updated at the same time as image updates for builds of 1/19/2007 &amp; later.  Please verify with your support representative that the correct revision level of these reports (6.21) is imported into your database.</P>
 <H3>1.1 Document Scanning</H3>
 <P>SAM Pro now supports document scanning and archiving. The scanned document will be saved as a .jpg image. Multiple pages are supported. This new functionality may be used in a variety of purposes, such as scanning in vendor invoices as they are vouchered in AP.</P>
 <H3>1.1.1 Setting Up</H3>
 <P>1. Extract the compressed file samproscan.zip into the directory containing the SAM Pro executable file (v.exe). samproscan.zip contains the program acquire.exe that SAM Pro will call to acquire the scanned image. </P>
 <P>2. All users that will be scanning documents must install a local scanner with TWAIN compatible driver software. </P>
 <P>3. Create a directory on the local machine in which the scanned images will reside.  </P>
 <P>4. To enable scanning, you must have a registry entry for document archiving with an archive directory set.  In addition, a directory for storing the scanned documents should be set.  </P>
 <P style="margin-left:36.00pt;"><FONT style="font-weight:bold; " >Registry Id:&nbsp;</FONT></P>
 <P class="Normal_Indent" ><FONT style="font-weight:bold; " >&nbsp;sys-document-archive</FONT></P>
 <P style="margin-left:36.00pt;"><FONT style="font-weight:bold; " >Contents/Additional Contents:</FONT></P>
 <P style="margin-left:41.75pt;text-indent:30.25pt;"><FONT style="font-weight:bold; " >directory=&lt;aDirectoryPathName&gt;</FONT></P>
 <P style="margin-left:36.00pt;">This entry is required, and defines the directory where all document archives are stored.</P>
 <P>&nbsp;&nbsp;<FONT style="font-weight:bold; " >scandirectory=&lt;ScanDirectoryPathName&gt;</FONT></P>
 <P class="Normal_Indent" >This is the local directory where the scan is stored.  </P>
 <P class="Normal_Indent" style="text-indent:36.00pt;"><FONT style="font-weight:bold; " >defaultscanparms=</FONT><FONT style="font-weight:bold; font-style:italic; " >parameters</FONT></P>
 <P class="Body_Text_Indent" style="margin-left:72.00pt;">This optional entry enables you to set the parameters used by the acquire.exe program. If the entry is not implemented, the default parameters are /Hide /Scan: the document will be scanned without bringing up the scanner driver box. Run Acquire.exe from the command prompt for a list of all parameters available. If you specify additional parameters you must also specify the default /scan and /hide options.</P>
 <H3>1.1.2 Scanning a Document</H3>
 <P>1. Access the SAM Pro record that you want to associate the scanned document with. For example, if you wish to scan the vendor invoice you have just received, the AP Journal entry you are using to voucher that invoice should be displayed. </P>
 <P>2. Verify that the scanner is turned on, and that scanning is enabled in the record window. The record must be previously saved with no changes for scanning to be enabled!</P>
 <P>3. <IMG src="images/img00014.gif" align=left border=0 height=34 width=56 alt="images\img00014.gif">  Click the Scan Document button. The Scan Document Wizard window appears instructing you to ‘’Load Next Document to Scan.  Insert the document you wish to scan in the scanner and then click the Scan Page button. </P>
 <P>4. The Wizard will ask ‘Did Current Document Scan Ok’.  After the scanner acquires the image and the Transferring Data box disappears, click the Yes button. If the Transferring Data box did not appear and the scanner did not seem to scan the document, click no and verify that the scanner is operational. </P>
 <P>5. The Scan Document Wizard will prompt you to load the next page to scan.  If you are scanning a multi-page document for this record, click Scan Page and repeat the scanning process.  If you have scanned all pages for this record, click Finish.</P>
 <P>6. The scanned page(s) are now attached to the record. They may be viewed by clicking the Attachment button located just above the Scan Document button. Note that multiple pages may be viewed from the ‘OtherFiles’ tab of the Document Viewer. </P>
 <H2>1.2 Document Viewer</H2>
 <P>This release corrects a problem where documents pointing URLs (http, https, and www) didn't successfully launch when the user's default browser was Firefox.</P>
 <P>Viewer: delete record/line operation now also deletes the associated archive file.</P>
 <H3>1.2.1 New Fields: Upper Section</H3>
 <P class="Tip_Note_Heading" style="margin-top:4.00pt;">Web Viewable CRM<BR>Web Viewable CSR<BR>Tech Viewable</P>
 <P>These fields are currently applicable only for Documents pointing to Client Site, Work Order, and Quote records.  If the Web Viewable CRM box is checked, CRMAnywhere users will be able to viewer this document if it is attached to a Client Site, Work Order, or Quote that ‘belongs’ to them.   Likewise, if the Web Viewable CSR box is checked, CSRAnywhere users will be able to viewer this document if it is attached to a Client Site, Work Order, or Quote that is assigned to them.   If Tech Viewable is selected, technicians will be able to view this document from TechAnywhere 2.0.</P>
 <P><FONT style="font-weight:bold; " >CRM Viewable Document Categories</FONT><BR>The  <A href="registry_entry_crmanywhere_viewable_document_categories.htm">Registry Entry to Set CRMAnywhere Viewable Document Categories</A> works in addition to the CRM Viewable box in the Document viewer.  If a document’s category is specified in this registry entry OR the CRM Viewer box is checked, that document will be viewable in CRMAnywhere.</P>
 <P><FONT style="font-weight:bold; " >New Button: Scan Document <BR>T</FONT>his button performs in a similar fashion to the Scan Button on the side bar of other Viewers. It enables you to scan an image and create a document. When the button is clicked, the Scan Wizard screens will appear, and the system will automatically generate the file path and name of the scanned image for you. </P>
 <H3>1.2.2 New Tab: Other Files</H3>
 <P>This tab is used by system to accommodate multiple page scanning. If you scan a document with more than one page, the system will use this tab to enter the file information for the additional files. </P>
 <H2>1.3 Saving Named Record Viewer Filter Ranges</H2>
 <P>This new feature enables users to name and save record filter ranges. </P>
 <H3>Record Range Viewers: New Fields </H3>
 <P><FONT style="font-weight:bold; " >Filter Keys:</FONT> <BR>The ‘Filter Keys’ selector pane is similar to the sort order selector at the bottom of the viewer record listing, and will initially be set to the same value. The Filter Keys pane controls how the list of records will be ordered, as well as which fields will be displayed; simply click on the desired order to select it.</P>
 <P><FONT style="font-weight:bold; " >Filter Ranges:</FONT> <BR>The ‘Filter Ranges’ selector pane enables you to select a customized range for the records.  When you click on a range, the criteria defining it will appear in the Id, Date and Text ranges below. Creating a customized filter range is discussed below. </P>
 <P>New Button:</P>
 <P class="toc_1" ><IMG src="images/saverange.gif" border="0" height="28" width="48" alt="images\saverange.gif"> </P>
 <P>This button enables you to assign a<FONT style="font-weight:bold; " > </FONT>name to and save your customized filter range settings. </P>
 <P>To do so, begin by completing all range fields as desired. </P>
 <P>Next, select a Filter Key to control the sort order of the records that you are filtering on. </P>
 <P>Click the Save Range button.</P>
 <P>A box will appear requesting that you enter the name of the range to save. Type in a descriptive range name, and click the OK button.</P>
 <P>Your custom range will be listed in the Filter Ranges pane.  When you access this range viewer in the future, you can select a save range by clicking on it in the Filter Ranges pane. </P>
 <P class="Reference_Line" style="margin-bottom:0.00pt;">&nbsp;</P>
 <P class="Reference_Line" style="margin-left:23.75pt;margin-bottom:0.00pt;border-top:0.50pt solid black;border-bottom:0.50pt solid black;border-left:0.50pt solid black;border-right:0.50pt solid black;"><FONT style="font-weight:bold; " >To delete</FONT> a custom filter range that you have created, double-click on it in the Filter Ranges pane. When the system displays a confirmation box, click Yes to delete the range, or No leave the range as it is.</P>
 <P style="margin-top:0;margin-bottom:0">&nbsp;</P>
 <P><FONT style="font-weight:bold; " >Filter Ranges for All Users<BR></FONT>You can create user-defined filter ranges that are available to all users with access to these records. To do so, the first character of the named range should be an asterisk (e.g., *overhead jobs for Ohio).  Named ranges beginning with an asterisk will appear on all users' filter ranges. Only the user that created the filter range is allowed to alter it. </P>
 <H2>1.4  Email Groups</H2>
 <H3>Purpose:</H3>
 <P>Email groups enable you to store list of email addresses, or lists of email groups to facilitate email distribution lists.  An email group (surrounded by brackets) may be referenced, or stored in any email field in the system; the system will then email to all members of the group. </P>
 <H3>Usage:</H3>
 <P>When referencing an Email Group in an email field, you must surround the Email Group Id with brackets. For example, if you have created an Email Group with the Id <FONT style="font-weight:bold; " >sales</FONT>, you would enter it in a SAM Pro email field as <FONT style="font-weight:bold; " >[sales]</FONT> to indicate that it is a token replacement and not, itself, an email address. </P>
 <P>The system evaluates the list of email addresses in the Email Group at the point of delivery, which is immediate when launched by clicking a &quot;direct&quot; email icon on a viewer...or...upon triggering of event when from scheduled events/reports.&nbsp; The Email Group is evaluated and all email addresses contained in the group will be mailed.</P>
 <H3>Important Fields: Upper Section</H3>
 <P class="Tip_Note_Heading" style="margin-top:4.00pt;">Id:</P>
 <P>Uniquely identifies this email distribution group. Do not include brackets in this field. </P>
 <P><FONT style="font-weight:bold; " >Name:<BR></FONT>A brief description of this group (optional). </P>
 <P><FONT style="font-weight:bold; " >Default Domain Name:<BR></FONT>If most or all of the users in this group share the same domain (e.g., @mycompanyname.com), you may enter it here and simply enter the individual user addresses in the lower section of the screen. </P>
 <H3>Important Fields: Addresses Tab</H3>
 <P><FONT style="font-weight:bold; " >Email Address:<BR></FONT>There are three different ways of entering an address on this line:</P>
 <P style="margin-top:0.00pt;">1. Enter the complete email address (e.g., <FONT style="color:blue; text-decoration:underline;" >sally@anycompanyname.com</FONT>). </P>
 <P style="margin-top:0.00pt;">2. If the Default Domain Name is completed above, enter just the individual and the system will add the @  sign and the default domain for you (if you enter mary, and the default domain is set to @mycompanyname.com, the system will use generate the complete address <FONT style="color:blue; text-decoration:underline;" >mary@mycompanyname.com</FONT> when the email is sent). </P>
 <P class="Reference_Line" style="margin-bottom:0.00pt;">3. Email groups support nesting, so you may reference one or more existing Email Groups as token replacements within another.  </P>
 <P class="Reference_Line" style="margin-left:36.00pt;margin-bottom:0.00pt;"><FONT style="font-weight:bold; text-decoration:underline;" >Examples:</FONT></P>
 <P class="Normal_Indent" style="margin-left:144.00pt;text-indent:-108.00pt;">Email Group Id: <FONT style="font-weight:bold; " >sales</FONT>   &nbsp;Default Domain: @mycompanyname.com   <BR>Addresses: jean, joe</P>
 <P class="Normal_Indent" style="margin-left:144.00pt;text-indent:-108.00pt;">&nbsp;Note that both jean and joe are at mycompanyname.com. You may list each address on an individual line, or separate multiple addresses on a single line with a comma.  </P>
 <P class="Normal_Indent" style="margin-left:144.00pt;text-indent:-108.00pt;">Email Group Id: <FONT style="font-weight:bold; " >dispatch</FONT>  &nbsp;Default Domain: @mycompany.com  <BR>Addresses: charles,emma,tom,mary@anycompanyname.com</P>
 <P class="Normal_Indent" style="margin-left:144.00pt;text-indent:-108.00pt;">&nbsp;Mary is at a different domain, so her complete address is specified.</P>
 <P class="Normal_Indent" style="margin-left:144.00pt;text-indent:-108.00pt;">Email Group Id: <FONT style="font-weight:bold; " >everyone</FONT>&nbsp;Default Domain:<BR>Addresses: [dispatch],[sales],prez@mycompany.com</P>
 <P class="Normal_Indent" style="margin-left:144.00pt;text-indent:-108.00pt;">&nbsp;In addition to the president, everyone on the dispatch and sales groups will be included when the '<FONT style="font-weight:bold; " >everyone'</FONT> email group is referenced. </P>
 <H2>1.5 Contact Viewer</H2>
 <H3>1.5.1 Expanded Functionality</H3>
 <P class="Reference_Line" style="margin-bottom:0.00pt;">The functionality of the Contact Viewer has been expanded to provide a single contact record that is related to a number of other records:</P>
 <P>Project Manager</P>
 <P>Project Principal</P>
 <P>Estimator</P>
 <P>Sales Rep</P>
 <P>Account Manager</P>
 <P>Dispatcher</P>
 <P>Service Manager</P>
 <P>User </P>
 <P>For all of the listed tables the email addresses, phone numbers, etc. have been removed from those records and replaced with a Contact Record Reference, which is now the universal spot to store that type of data...this enables the creation of a single contact record with this information to be maintained in a single place, but be related to a number of other structures...i.e. we create a contact &quot;jean knox&quot; with all contact info....jean knox may be a User, a Project Manager, a Project Principal, an Estimator, a Service Manager, etc....all of these things, but we only have to edit the Contact record to change this info for all references.</P>
 <P><FONT style="font-weight:bold; font-style:italic; " >Note that a Contact record will only be generated during conversion if an email, email fax, or email pager number is included in a record (e.g, User, Account Manager, etc.) that is eligible to generate a Contact record. </FONT><FONT style="font-weight:bold; font-style:italic; " ><BR></FONT><BR><FONT style="font-weight:bold; " >Conversion Considerations</FONT></P>
 <P class="Reference_Line" style="margin-bottom:0.00pt;">Since some of these records already contained contact information, the conversion will create &quot;contacts&quot; for existing structures that had data elements that are now maintained in the contact record (not all of them originally had these data elements, so not every structure will lead to new contact records).  Records created during conversion will be marked as such.  We suggest that you review your contact data after the conversion is run. It is possible that more than one Contact record may have been created for a single individual. In this case, all records should be edited to point to the desired contact record.  Once the References tab an extraneous Contact record is blank (e.g., no other records reference it), the extraneous Contact record may be deleted. <BR><BR>Escalation Manager and related functionalities now goes to the referenced contact record to perform the email address lookups.</P>
 <P class="Reference_Line" style="margin-bottom:0.00pt;"><FONT style="font-weight:bold; " >Security Id:</FONT> if your firm uses Security Id’s, they are not currently set in the new contact records. Please contact your support representative to set these fields for you. </P>
 <H3>1.5.2 Important Fields: Upper Section</H3>
 <P class="Reference_Line" style="margin-bottom:0.00pt;"><FONT style="font-weight:bold; " >Notes:<BR></FONT>This field will indicate if this record was created during a database update, and if so, from which type of record (e.g., usr=User Record). </P>
 <P>New Fields:</P>
 <P><FONT style="font-weight:bold; " >Email Fax:<BR></FONT>If Faxaway is implemented on your system, enter the Email Fax address for this contact. </P>
 <P><FONT style="font-weight:bold; " >Email Pager:<BR></FONT>This field should be completed if<FONT style="font-weight:bold; " > </FONT>this contact is to receive email pages for alarms and notifications. </P>
 <H3>1.5.3 New Tab: References</H3>
 <P><FONT style="font-weight:bold; " >Table Name:<BR></FONT>The type of record (Project Manager, User, Project Principal, etc.) that is referencing this Contact.</P>
 <P><FONT style="font-weight:bold; " >Id:&nbsp;Name/Description:<BR></FONT>The individual record within the specified Table that is referencing this Contact.  </P>
 <P>You may double-click on a line to open the referencing record. </P>
 <P>If this tab is blank, records ( in the Project Manager,  Project Principal, Estimator,  Sales Rep, Account Manager, Dispatcher, Service Manager or User tables) do <FONT style="text-decoration:underline;" >not</FONT> reference this particular Contact record.</P>
 <H2>1.6 User Viewer</H2>
 <P><FONT style="font-weight:bold; " >New Field - Contact Id:<BR></FONT>This field specifies the record that supplies the e-mail, phone and address contact information for this User. </P>
 <P><FONT style="font-weight:bold; " >Changed Fields:</FONT> <BR>In previous releases, the Email field was set directly in the User record. In version 6.2, this information was removed from the User record and replaced with a Contact Record Reference, which is now the universal spot to store that type of data. </P>
 <P><FONT style="font-weight:bold; " >Notes:<BR>Email Address:  Email Fax:  Email Pager:<BR></FONT>These display-only fields default from the Contact record.  To update them, right-click on the Contact Id and edit the Contact record directly. </P>
 <H2>1.7  Zip Code Viewer</H2>
 <H2>Purpose:</H2>
 <P>Specify geographical defaults by postal code. When you enter a postal code in an address field, the city, state and service zone (if applicable) will default. </P>
 <H2>Usage:</H2>
 <P>This new functionality DOES NOT apply until turned on (for all or specific records) via the 'sys-zipcode-lookup' registry entry.&nbsp;Contact your support rep to enable this setting.&nbsp;</P>
 <H2>Important Fields:</H2>
 <P><FONT style="font-weight:bold; " >Zip Code Id:<BR></FONT>The 5 or 9-digit US ZIP Code or the postal code in use in your country. </P>
 <P><FONT style="font-weight:bold; " >State</FONT>:<BR>The official 2-character state or province code.  </P>
 <P><FONT style="font-weight:bold; " >City</FONT>:<BR>The postal stop city for this zip code. </P>
 <P><FONT style="font-weight:bold; " >County: Area Code: Latitude: Longitude: Daylight Savings?<BR></FONT>These optional fields may be entered for reporting purposes. </P>
 <P><FONT style="font-weight:bold; " >Service Zone Id:<BR>T</FONT>his field can be used to default in the Service Zone in the Client Site record.  Contact your service representative if you wish to implement this functionality. </P>
 <H2>1.8 Bank Deposit Journal</H2>
 <P>Error checking added to verify that the interest/fees gl accounts are filled in if interest/fee amounts are entered.</P>
 <P>The Delete and Delete Line buttons have been disabled in this journal. If you need to edit an entry, you may clear the CL box on a previously reconciled check, and the system will the Date Reconciled on the Check record, so that that check will again be eligible for reconciliation. </P>
 <P>Corrects problem on edits that change Fee / Bank Service Fee GL accounts. </P>
 <P><FONT style="font-weight:bold; " >GL Account<BR>GL Sweep Account<BR></FONT>These fields are now sticky; when entering a new transaction, the system default in the value from the previous entry; this may be changed if needed.  </P>
 <P><FONT style="font-weight:bold; " >Bank Reconciliation and Clear Checks<BR></FONT>The system no longer lists Checks reconciled via Clear Check when the AutoFill button is clicked. This enhancement enables users who have previously been using Clear Check to switch over to the new Bank Reconciliation functionality.</P>
 <H2>1.9 SAM Pro Licensing </H2>
 <P>Beginning with the release of v6.2, use of a vrgstry.cus file is a requirement; pre-v6.2 registry files must be replaced during the conversion to v6.2. The same process will apply as each new version is released and installed. Your support representative will supply this file at the time of conversion. Versions 6.2 and up strictly enforce the number of active users specified for your company.  </P>
 <H3>1.9.1 Users Database</H3>
 <P>SAM PRO's user licensing technology has been enhanced so that a separate Users database is no longer required. This change should simplify both the installation and support of new and converted SAMPRO installations</P>
 <P><FONT style="font-weight:bold; " >Multiple Log Ins<BR>I</FONT>f you attempt to log in more than once (e.g, at two workstations simultaneously), that log in will be accepted and any current session for the same user id will be disabled.&nbsp; The DISABLED session will be able to finish any unsaved edit, but will not be able to proceed otherwise.&nbsp; </P>
 <H2>1.10  Filter Options</H2>
 <P>~&nbsp;(Global Not)</P>
 <P>The tilde (~) is a NOT operator. When the first character is a ~ the rest of the filter indicates which to exclude.  For example, <FONT style="font-weight:bold; " >~a,p,m</FONT> will include all values except a, p or m.</P>
 <H2>1.11 Crystal Reports Viewer</H2>
 <P>Enhancements have been made to the SAM Pro Crystal View. In addition, Crystal reports may be scheduled for generation and distribution.  Please contact your support representative for details.</P>
 <H2>1.12. Clear Check</H2>
 <P>The Cleared total now displays correctly if Check All button used</P>
 <H2>1.13 Daylight Savings Time</H2>
 <P>SAM Pro has been updated to conform to the new  rules that, starting in March 2007, daylight time in the United States will begin on the second Sunday in March and end on the first Sunday in November.  This information is used for Time Zone offsets.  It is dependent upon a correct server time; be sure to verify that your servers are displaying the correct time when Daylight Savings goes into effect. </P>
 <H2>1.14 Print Screen Functionality</H2>
 <P>The Faststone free screenshot capturing software has been used successfully by our support department to supplement the SAM Pro File &gt;&gt; Print Screen function that has been experiencing intermittent problems. You can Google 'FastStone' to get to it easily. With FastStone, you push your keyboard's PrintScreen key and then push the Print button on the screen that opens.</P>
 <H2>1.15 Required Fields and Disabled Fields</H2>
 <P>SAM Pro now supports required field color coding. Users may now set the background color of required fields via the Set Color Palette button on the second line of the Top Button Bar. Fields that are required by the software – or by registry settings (see below) will both be displayed with the background color.</P>
 <P>Disabled fields will now appear as display only.</P>
 <P>Support registry entries are now available that will enable specific fields to be marked as disabled or required for specific record and journal viewers. Please contact your support representative for details. </P>
 <H2>1.16  Diagnostic Alerts</H2>
 <P><FONT style="font-weight:bold; " >AP Journal, AR Cash Receipts, Purchase Order:</FONT> the system will now alert you if an out of balance transaction will be made  in one of these journals.  The transaction will not be saved. </P>
 <H2>1.17 User Report Definitions</H2>
 <P><FONT style="font-weight:bold; " >Changed  Field: Sign Control</FONT></P>
 <P>This release changes the default behavior of the Sign Control field. Previously, a value '-' resulted in a trailing sign. Now, a value of '-' results in a leading sign.</P>
 <P>As before, a blank value will result in a trailing sign.&nbsp;</P>
 <H2>1.18  Closed Filter for Journal viewers</H2>
 <P><FONT style="font-weight:bold; " >Change Field: Next Id</FONT></P>
 <P>When you select the Closed filter on a Journal listing, the Next Id range is now automatically set to = so that only the final JE appears for Closed entries.</P>
 <P>Note that Deleted entries will not appear on a Closed listing because their Next Id is set to ‘Deleted’.  To view only Deleted entries, enter Deleted in the Next Id range, clear the other ranges, and click the Filter Records button to display the list. </P>
 <H2>1.19 Windows Vista and SAM Pro Help</H2>
 <P>As of this date, Windows Vista does not include a viewer for the most common type of help files, used since the release of Windows 95. Programs such as SAM Pro using these help files will display an error message when you try to access the Help System unless a special Help patch has been installed.  This patch is available as an installer; contact your support representative if you have experienced this problem.</P>
 <H2>1.20 User Notes</H2>
 <P>Word Wrap has been implemented in user Notes so text will no longer scroll off the side of the screen. Word Wrap will automatically accommodate the text when the Notes viewer is resized. </P>
 <H1>2. Registry</H1>
 <H2>2.1 Registry Entry to Override Windows Registry Associations</H2>
 <P>A SAM Pro registry entry is now available to overrides the Windows registry entry for file associations.  In rare cases, this may be required to enable scanning or other functions. Contact your support representative for details. &nbsp; </P>
 <H2>2.2 New Options for New Call Registry Entry (sys-newcall)</H2>
 <H3>Disable Filtering of Equipment by Service Category</H3>
 <P><FONT style="font-weight:bold; " >Setting Key: </FONT>FilterEquipmentByServiceCategory<FONT style="font-weight:bold; " >&nbsp;&nbsp;Setting Value: </FONT>false<FONT style="font-weight:bold; " ><BR></FONT>This entry disables the filtering of the New Call Equipment List when the Service Category is filled in; all active equipment will be listed, regardless of its Service Category.

 <P>The first format enables you to specify the Quote viewer options by branch id and  (optionally) user.  If this entry is specific to a user, the branch must be specified if a user belongs to a branch.  If branches are not implemented, two dashes (not separated by a space) must precede the user id.  </P>
 <P>The second format enables you to specify options by security id.  </P>
 <P>The third format would apply to all users unless another registry entry was created for their security or branch/user id.</P>

 <P class="Tip_Note_Heading" style="margin-left:36.00pt;margin-top:4.00pt;">AutoUpdateWOTechStatus=WaitCustApprvl</P>
 <P class="Reference_Line" style="margin-left:36.00pt;margin-bottom:0.00pt;">This option concerns the lead workorder (referenced on the Main tab of the Quote viewer). By default, the status of the Technicians on the Work Order Technician Tab is not affected when the work order is used to generate a Quote.  However, by implementing this registry setting, what a Quote is saved with a new (or different) Work Order Id in the Main Quote Tab, the system will change the individual Technician Statuses to WaitCustApprvl, which may also impact the Work Order Escalation Status. </P>
 <P class="Tip_Note_Heading" style="margin-left:36.00pt;margin-top:4.00pt;">AutoUpWOTechStatusIgnore=status1,status2,status3....</P>
 <P style="margin-left:36.00pt;">where <FONT style="font-style:italic; " >status1 </FONT>(and so on) is replaced by a valid technician (log type) status.  This option instructs the system that technician lines with these statuses should not be updated to WaitCustApprvl as noted in the entry above.  </P>
 <P style="margin-left:36.00pt;">Example:</P>
 <P style="margin-left:72.00pt;">AutoUpdateWOTechStatus=WaitCustApprvl</P>
 <P style="margin-left:72.00pt;">AutoUpdateWOTechStatusIgnore=cancelled,credit hold,tech declined</P>
 <P style="margin-left:72.00pt;">In this example, if a work order was used to generate a quote, the following would occur when the Quote was saved:</P>
 <P style="margin-left:72.00pt;">Entries on the Technicians tab for the work order would be set to a status of WaitCustApprvl unless the status was cancelled, credit hold or tech declined</P>
 <P style="margin-left:72.00pt;">If the tech status was cancelled, credit hold or tech declined, the status (log type) on that  work order technician line would not be updated</P>

 <P><FONT style="font-weight:bold; " >WOSubPOIdEqualsWOId=false<BR></FONT>A new field has been added to the WO Technician tab to allow recording and tracking of PO numbers by sub by WO.&nbsp; To fully implement this functionality, this option must be implemented to   'undo' the current requirement that the WO Id and PO Ids match.&nbsp; See section 2.5 of these release notes for additional information. </P>
 <H3>2.4.1 Accounting Period Update on Log In</H3>
 <P>These options provide registry controlled log-in options to evaluate the system date to activate and set the default property of the accounting period which includes that date. If one of these options is implemented, the system will display a message box that informs the user that this has occurred. <FONT style="font-weight:bold; " >We recommend discussing this option with your support representative before implementing it.</FONT> </P>
 <H6>UpdateAccountingPeriodsDuringLogin=SetDefault</H6>

 <H6>UpdateAccountingPeriodsDuringLogin=true</H6>
 <P style="margin-left:36.00pt;"><FONT style="text-decoration:underline;" >This option is similar to the previous but also inactivates all other accounting periods and should only be used with caution.</FONT> When this option is implemented, the system will compare the system date with the Accounting Period currently flagged as Default.

 <P><FONT style="font-weight:bold; " >NewRecordAfterAdd=true<BR>NewRecordAfterChange=true<BR></FONT>These options will execute the ‘new record’ function each time a record is added (NewRecordAfterAdd=true) and/or an existing record is save (NewRecordAfterChange=true). This registry option pertains to all static records (such as the client site) as well as journals.  </P>
 <P><FONT style="font-weight:bold; " >RefreshRecordAfterAdd=true<BR>RefreshRecordAfterChange=true<BR></FONT>These options will refresh the screen each time a record is added (RefreshRecordAfterAdd=true) and/or an existing record is save (RefreshRecordAfterChange=true). This registry option pertains to all static records (such as the client site) as well as journals.  </P>
 <P>Alternately, these options can be implemented for individual viewers instead of globally.&nbsp; For example, the Work Order viewer registry entry would be as follows...</P>
 <P style="margin-left:36.00pt;">Id: sys-viewer-vwrkordr<BR>Contents: RefreshRecordAfterAdd=true<BR>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;   RefreshRecordAfterChange=true</P>

The user should then enter the reason for the changes to / addition of the record, and save and close the note. This registry option pertains to all static records (such as the client site) as well as journals.  </P>
 <P>These options can be implemented for individual viewers instead of globally. We highly recommend implementing one or both of these options on an individualized, viewer-by-viewer basis. For example, if the following registry entry were implemented, a Notes window would open when an Employee record was changed, so that the user could document the reason for the change.  </P>

 <P><FONT style="font-weight:bold; " >GLReport3LinesPerInch=7.5&nbsp;</FONT> (or whatever value is needed)</P>
 <P>This new registry option enables you to set the Lines Per Inch for GLReport3 class reports. If this option is implemented, all user GL Reports that use the class GLReport3 will have their Lines per Inch set to the above registry value. This option should be used with caution as ALL lines, regardless of the font size that you have specified, will be impacted by this setting. </P>

 <H2>2.7 New Registry Dispatch Board Registry Option (sys-dispatchboard)</H2>
 <H3>Prevent the Work Order List from Loading when the Dispatch Board is Opened </H3>
 <P>This registry option allows the Dispatch Board to open without producing a WO list until the user presses the refresh button. It will be implemented if a user exits from the Dispatch Board with their filtering parameters set wide open; in this case, subsequent attempts to re-open the Dispatch Board may be unsuccessful because the initial WO list queries hang the database server.&nbsp;</P>
 <H4>Contents / Additional Contents</H4>

 <P style="text-indent:30.25pt;">or </P>
 <P style="text-indent:30.25pt;"><FONT style="font-weight:bold; " >SkipWOListOnOpen=warn<BR></FONT><BR>Both cause the work order list to be suppressed until the user explicitly pushes the Refresh button on the top toolbar.&nbsp; If 'warn' is used, the user receives a warning during the Dispatch Board open.</P>
 <H2>2.8  Registry Entries to Set Classic / Day Board Color Coding</H2>
 <P>The registry entries discussed in sections 2.8.1-2 of these release enhance the ability of users to adjust the color coding of the standard Classic and Day Board configurations.  The background colors of the Zone and Workcode fields may now be adjusted.  These enhancements are in addition to the existing registry entries (described in sections 2.8.3 and 2.8.4) for setting the background of each Day or Classic Board information cell may be set to the colors specified for its Status, and for color coding by work order priority.  </P>
 <P class="Body_Text_Indent" style="margin-left:5.75pt;"><FONT style="font-weight:bold; " >Color-Coding by Multiple Fields</FONT></P>
 <P class="Body_Text_Indent" style="margin-left:5.75pt;">You may also enable color-coding for the Priority, Workcode, and Status fields by implementing the registry options discussed in these release notes. Be aware, however, that an overly complicated system is difficult for users to understand and use effectively. </P>

 <H3>Open Work Orders – Limit WO’s displayed  to DaysHistoryLimit Date of Creation:</H3>
 <P>In previous releases, open work orders were excluded if the date created is more then &quot;DaysHistoryLimit&quot; set in the web-settings registry. In this release, this constraint is dropped by default: there will not be any age control on open work orders. To restore the original behavior, the following option may be added to the web-settings registry entry or registry tabs of the Web Profile or Web User:</P>
 <P><FONT style="font-weight:bold; " >&nbsp;</FONT><FONT style="font-weight:bold; " >usedayshistorylimitforopen=true</FONT></P>
 <P>If this option is present, then the days history limit will be used when querying the database for open service requests and open work orders. If this is set to anything other than true or not present at all, the days history limit will not be used when querying the database for open service requests and open work orders.</P>
 <H3>Registry Entry to Block Quotes without a Quote Report Id</H3>
 <P>This registry option may be enabled to block partially built quotes from appearing in CRMAnywhere. If the following registry option is implemented, the absence of the report id in the QuoteMaster header will be used to determine if the Quote should appear in CRMAnywhere. Note that the absence of a report id prevents CRMAnywhere from listing the quote.</P>
 <P style="text-indent:30.25pt;"><FONT style="font-weight:bold; " >BlockedQuotes=true</FONT></P>
 <P><FONT style="font-weight:bold; font-style:italic; " >If registry settings have been made in the Web User or Web Profile registry tabs, this option must be set in these tabs to implement this option. </FONT></P>
 <H3>CSR Anywhere  –  Registry Entry to Specify WO Report</H3>
 <P>On the Acknowledge Leads page, the WO Id is a clickable link. If you click it, runs the WOList report and displays it by default. This works fine UNLESS there is a function substitution registry entry that points rwolist to something else (e.g., a crystal report the user doesn’t have access to).  To handle this problem, the following registry option should be added to web-settings to allow the standard WO Report function id (rwolist – and whatever function substitution it points to) to overridden. </P>

 <H2>2.10 New Registry Options for Purchase Orders (sys-viewer-vprchseordrlst)</H2>
 <H3>2.10.1  Set Purchase Order Ship To Designation </H3>
 <P>These new registry options enable you to customize how the shipping address will be generated when the various Ship-To options (StockLocation, ServiceProvider or WorkSite) are selected on the Purchase Order’s Ship Address tab. It is strongly suggested that you discuss this option with your support representative before implementing it. </P>
 <P style="margin-top:0;margin-bottom:0">&nbsp;</P>
 <P class="Tip_Note_Heading" style="margin-top:4.00pt;">Contents/Additional Contents:</P>
 <P><FONT style="font-weight:bold; " >sqlShipToStockLocation</FONT><FONT style="font-weight:bold; font-style:italic; " >={SQL select list}<BR></FONT><FONT style="font-weight:bold; " >&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;sqlShipToServiceProvider</FONT><FONT style="font-weight:bold; font-style:italic; " >={SQL select list}</FONT><FONT style="font-weight:bold; " ><BR>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;sqlShipToWorkSite</FONT><FONT style="font-weight:bold; font-style:italic; " >={SQL select list}</FONT><FONT style="font-weight:bold; " ><BR></FONT><BR>The above options enable you to specify how the Ship-To options (StockLocation, ServiceProvider or WorkSite) operate when filling in the Purchase Order’s Ship Address. </P>
 <H3>The SQL Select List</H3>
 <P>The SQL Select List defines which fields from the Location, Technician or Client Site record (depending upon which option you selected) will be inserted into the corresponding fields in the Purchase Order Ship To address. </P>
 <P>The select list MUST include all seven columns necessary to construct the ship-to address as follows:</P>
 <P>&nbsp; &nbsp; 1. street address line 1<BR>&nbsp; &nbsp; 2. street address line 2<BR>&nbsp; &nbsp; 3. street address line 3<BR>&nbsp; &nbsp; 4. street address line 4<BR>&nbsp; &nbsp; 5. city<BR>&nbsp; &nbsp; 6. state<BR>&nbsp; &nbsp; 7. zip code</P>
 <P>If you will not be using all of the address lines, you may include a blank ‘ ‘ in the select list.  Token replacement for ^companyname^ has also been implemented.&nbsp; If you are shipping to your firm’s stocking location, you may specify column 1 as ‘^companyname^’ if the <A href="registry_company_name_entry.htm">Registry Entry to set your Company Name</A>  has been implemented. </P>
 <P>Examples:</P>
 <P>Here's an example for building a ship-to address for a stocking location. It uses the ^companyname^ token replacement  to set the first line of the address, and skips the fourth line of the street address by specifying a blank ‘ ‘.<BR><BR>sqlShipToStockLocation='^companyname^', lctn_addrss_shp_addrss_strt, lctn_addrss_shp_addrss_strt_2, ' ', lctn_addrss_shp_addrss_cty, lctn_addrss_shp_addrss_stte, lctn_addrss_shp_addrss_zp</P>
 <P class="Normal_Indent" >The following example customizes the ServiceProvider option. It will set the first line of the Shipping Address to the Technician Name, and the second to ‘Parts Department’ field for a subcontractor vendor.  The third and fourth lines will be set to the street address fields from the technician record. </P>
 <P>sqlShipToServiceProvice=tchncn_nme, ‘Parts Department’, tchncn_strt_addrss1, tchncn_strt_addrss2, tchncn_cty, tchncn_stte, tchncn_zp</P>
 <H3>Technical Note:</H3>
 <P>Each of these options generates a 'from clause' and the appropriate joins are hard-coded into the SAM Pro software as described below.<BR><BR>sqlShipToStockLocation <BR>&nbsp; &nbsp; from wrkordr, lctn where wrkordr.wrkordr_rn={PO's wrkordr_rn}<BR>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; and lctn.lctn_rn={PO's lctn_rn}<BR><BR>sqlShipToServiceProvider...<BR>&nbsp; &nbsp; from wrkordr, wrkordrtchncn, tchncn, vndr  where wrkordr.wrkordr_rn={PO's wrkordr_rn}<BR>&nbsp; &nbsp; and wrkordr.wrkordr_rn=wrkordrtchncn.wrkordr_rn and wrkordrtchncn.tchncn_rn=tchncn.tchncn_rn<BR>&nbsp; &nbsp; and tchncn_wb_accss='subcontractor' and tchncn.vndr_rn=vndr.vndr_rn <BR>     order by wrkordrtchncn_ln<BR><BR>sqlShipToWorkSite...<BR>&nbsp; &nbsp; from wrkordr, clntste where wrkordr.wrkordr_rn={PO's wrkordr_rn}<BR>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; and wrkordr.clntste_rn=clntste.clntste_rn</P>
 <H3>2.10.2 Note on AutoFillReceived Option</H3>
 <P>Currently, the 'AutoFillReceived=true' registry option (sys-viewer-vprchseordrlst) applies equally to all vendors.&nbsp; This change includes a new field in the Vendor record (Disable PO Autofill) that allows disabling of the AutoFill option on a vendor-specific basis.</P>
 <H3>2.10.2 Registry Entry to control saving Extended PO Description to Inventory Item</H3>
 <P>The PO Viewer's Inventory tab includes an 'Extended Description' field (note: you must click the Magnify button to view this field). When the PO is saved, the contents of this field is copied to the corresponding inventory item's Purchase Order Description field on the PO Description tab. For some customers this is an undesirable behavior. The following registry entry option overrides this default behavior:</P>
 <P>saveInventoryExtendedDescription=No  or  Yes</P>
 <P>If this entry is implemented with the No option, the extended description will <FONT style="text-decoration:underline;" >not</FONT> be written to the Inventory Item record’s PO Description tab when the purchase order is saved. </P>
 <P>If this entry is not present (or implemented with the Yes option), the extended description will be written to the Inventory Item record when the purchase order is saved, maintaining the previous default behavior. </P>
 <P style="margin-top:0;margin-bottom:0">&nbsp;</P>
 <H2>2.11  Registry Entry Web Access Defaults</H2>
 <H3>Purpose:</H3>
 <P>This provides a means of specifying different initial work order status defaults for a Tech with web access = 'none' versus a web access = 'technician', ‘subcontractor’ or ‘csr’.&nbsp;<FONT style="font-weight:bold; " >It will also override any user-selected status changes in New Call.</FONT><FONT style="color:blue; font-weight:bold; " > </FONT></P>
 <H3>Usage:</H3>
 <P>We strongly recommend discussing this registry entry with your support representative before implementing it as it has implications involving escalation management and dispatching. The default behavior for the system, in the absence of this registry entry, is for new work orders to be set to Waiting Service (if Web Access = None in the Technician record)  or Unacknowledged (if Web Access= Technician).  </P>
 <H3>Important Fields:</H3>
 <P class="Tip_Note_Heading" style="margin-top:4.00pt;">Id:</P>
 <P class="Reference_Line" style="margin-bottom:0.00pt;">The basic registry Id is 'sys-web-access-' + the Remote Access Type from the Technician viewer. The possible registry Id’s are:</P>

 <H3>2.11.1 TechAnywhere Option </H3>
 <H4>NewWorkOrderStatus=Pending&nbsp;</H4>
 <P class="Reference_Line" style="margin-bottom:0.00pt;">A new WO Status, Pending, has been created. This status is designed for use with TechAnywhere so that a work order can be created as pending, but not be sent to the technician’s wireless device until is released by the dispatcher.  When this option is implemented, all new wo’s for technicians with remote access will be created with a status of Pending. When the Release to Tech button (on the dispatch board or the work order Technician tab) is clicked, the line’s status will be changed from Pending to the Default Status for the technician.  The typical registry entry for this situation would be:</P>
 <P class="Reference_Line" style="margin-bottom:0.00pt;">&nbsp;Id: &nbsp;&nbsp;sys-web-access-technician</P>
 <P class="Reference_Line" style="margin-left:36.00pt;margin-bottom:0.00pt;">Contents: &nbsp;DefaultStatus=Unacknowledged&nbsp;</P>

 <P>If this registry option is set to No, AND the Technician is not a Sub, flagged Service Parts will not be used to create quoted lines on the PM Work Order.</P>
 <P>If this registry option is set to Sub, AND the Technician is not a Sub, handle flagged Service Parts using the subcontractor processing (that writes these parts to the Work Requested).</P>
 <P>If this registry option is set to Yes or is not present, use the default processing that flagged Service Parts are used to create quoted lines on the PM Work Order.</P>
 <H3>Option to set Job Cost Category of Flagged PM Parts</H3>
 <P>If flagged parts from the PM's parts list are written to the Inventory or Other tabs (if the TechServiceParts=Yes or this option is absent), the following registry option enables you to select a default job cost category for each of these.&nbsp;</P>

 <P style="margin-left:36.00pt;">These options are used to specify the email address to which the TechAnywhere posting logs should be sent , as well as the ‘from’ address used in the email.  If the ‘to’ option is specified, a ‘from’ must also be included. </P>
 <H6>InventoryCostCategoryId=<FONT style="font-weight:normal; font-style:italic; " >jobcostcategoryid</FONT></H6>
 <P style="margin-left:36.00pt;">This option provides the default Job Cost Category to be used when Inventory lines are written to a Work Order from TechAnywhere.  This may be overridden by the following option, which sets the Job Cost Category by Inventory Group. </P>

All other Inventory Items posted to Work Orders from TechAnywhere will be assigned the Job Cost Category of ‘TAMaterials’. </P>
 <H2>2.18 Registry Entry Payroll / AP Check Report – Set GL Account and Entity</H2>
 <H3>Purpose:</H3>
 <P class="Reference_Line" style="margin-bottom:0.00pt;">This enhancement adds registry entry control to prevent user from selecting inappropriate GL Bank accounts and entities when printing checks.&nbsp; This applies to both AP and PR checks, although a separate registry would be required for each.&nbsp; </P>

 <P style="margin-left:36.00pt;">The purpose of the DefaultGLBankAccount entry is to provide a default account that CAN be overridden during the check printing.&nbsp; Use of GLBankAccount and DefaultGLBankAccount should be thought of as mutually exclusive even though the Registry viewer won't prevent it. Do not use both!<BR><BR>The rules for Entity defaulting and validation are similar to the above description for GL Accounts.</P>
 <H3>2.18.1 Canadian Checks – CPA Compliancy – sys-report-rapchck and sys-report-rprchck</H3>
 <P>Checks to Check Formatting required to comply with CPA standards have been implemented. This check formatting is enabled for ‘CA’ customizations.  It may be necessary to adjust the check positioning; please print a test page to ascertain if any registry changes are needed. </P>
 <P>Registry options: </P>
 <P><FONT style="font-weight:bold; " >PrintIndicators=true </FONT></P>

 <H2>2.19 Registry Entry Consolidated Invoices - Specify Sequential Id Counter </H2>
 <H3>Purpose:</H3>
 <P>This new feature allows for auto-sequencing of Consolidated Invoice Ids.&nbsp; This registry entry may be used to specify the prefix. </P>
 <P>To avoid invoice Id duplication issues, auto-generated Consolidated Invoice Numbers are comprised of an alphabetic prefix and a numeric counter. We strongly recommend that you carefully evaluate your existing Consolidated Invoice numbers when selecting a prefix so that your auto-generated numbers will not conflict with the existing ones that were manually entered. </P>
 <H3>Usage:</H3>
 <P>User can key in their own Ids in the Consolidated Invoice viewer if they'd prefer to operate the old way.&nbsp; An Id is assigned on Add Record if the user hasn't supplied one.</P>
 <H3>Important:</H3>

 <P style="margin-left:36.00pt;">Where <FONT style="font-style:italic; " >ABC</FONT> is replaced by the characters that you wish to specify as your invoice prefix. The default prefix is 'C' if this registry option is not implemented (e.g., the first auto-sequenced invoice Id is C10001, the second C10002, etc.).  If you change the prefix, the counter will continue in its sequence and will not be set back to its original value (of 10001).  </P>
 <H2>2.20 New Option for sys-securityexceptionsbytable</H2>
 <P>The current registry entry is designed for listing all tables that WON'T BE subject to security logic. This enhancement allows the system handle the exceptions in one-way or the other...to provide additional flexibility in configuration.</P>
 <H4>ExceptionProperty=IncludeOnly </H4>
 <P class="Reference_Line" style="margin-bottom:0.00pt;">If this option is specified, all tables listed in this registry entry will be included in the user’s security level. All tables not special will be created as global (no security id).  It is strongly recommended that you discuss this option with your support representative before implementing:  changing your security methodology in midstream can lead to unintended consequences.</P>
 <H2>2.21 Registry Entry TechFinder (sys-tech-finder)</H2>   Additional Options
 <P>The following options enable you to control the entries that appear on the TechFinder Scheduled Hours grid by overriding either the Escalation statuses allowed (displayed on the Work Order Other Info tab) or the statuses on the Technician tab. It strongly recommended that you confer with your support representative before implementing either of these options. </P>

 <P>By default the TechFinder Scheduled Hours grid includes hours for work orders set to the following escalation statuses:  new, unacknowledged, acknowledged, waiting service, active, quote approved, scheduled, completed.

 <P class="Normal_Indent" >This excludes work order whose escalation status is waiting quote but includes those that are pending. </P>
 <H2>2.22 New Registry Option for Start Create PM WO (sys-start-scrtepmwo)</H2>
 <P>The order of the Inspection lines displayed in this function's check list viewer is critical to determining how individual inspection lines can be combined into a single WO. In the absence of this option, the default ORDER BY is &quot;clntste_id, clntsteeqpmntpm_dte_schdld_inspctn, wrkcde_prrty, clntsteeqpmnt_id&quot; which may not always produce the optimal results.</P>
 <P>The ORDER BY registry entry should support references to any column in this list of tables - clntste, clntsteeqpmnt, clntsteeqpmntpm, scrty, srvcetsks, brnch, wrkcde, clnt, jbcstcde, jb, prjct, srvcectgry, tchncn. </P>

 <H2>2.23 New Registry Option for W2 Reporting (sys-report-rw2)</H2>
 <P>This registry option enables partial year reporting for your W2’s. This would be desirable if, for example, your company’s EIN changed mid-year.  To enable this functionality, the following option must be added to your sys-report-rW2 registry entry</P>
 <P style="margin-left:36.00pt;"><FONT style="font-weight:bold; " >PartialYearReporting=true</FONT></P>
 <P><FONT style="font-weight:bold; " >Note:</FONT> Two new fields have been added to Report W2’s: Start Date and End Date.  The system will now set the Start Date(01/01) and the End Date(12/31) whenever the Year field gets changed. The system will reject attempts to edit the Start Date and the End Date unless the new registry entry is set.  </P>
 <H2>2.24 Registry Entry for 1099 Report</H2>
 <P>The functionality of RAP1099.rpt, revision level 6.21, has been updated to enable a second remit to address to print on the 1099 form. The following registry entry specifies that a second address limit will be printed on this revised report::</P>

 <H3>7.1.1 Inventory Item Unit Cost computation – Change to Default Behavior</H3>
 <P>This release enhances the computation of the Inventory Items Unit Cost for items tagged as using the Average Cost methodology. It corrects inconsistencies that occurred when the quantity on hand at location went negative, and will result in a more accurate calculation of average cost. The Inventory Item Record, Purchase Order, Client Order, Work Order Inventory Tab, Shop Order, Inventory Receipt Journal, Inventory Adjustments Journal, Inventory Journal, and the Job Journal are impacted by this change. In Quotemaster, the enhanced average cost calculations are used, but not the following costing hierarchy (if a Vendor is specified in the Inventory Item, the last cost for this Vendor will default).</P>
 <P><FONT style="font-weight:bold; " >Inventory Costing Hierarchy</FONT></P>
 <P>The following costing hierarchy is now employed to determine the unit cost of inventory items. If the preferred computation (#1) is not available (for example, the item does not exist at the specified location), the system will try the second, then the third, and so on.  The unit cost computation will depend on whether the Inventory Item is flagged as used Average, Last or Standard. <FONT style="font-weight:bold; " >Since the Standard Cost is used if the system cannot locate a more recent / precise cost, it is very important for this field to be completed in the Inventory Item record. </FONT></P>
 <P>Note: ‘constrained by Where’ indicates that the Inventory History query may be conditioned by inventory location, serial number, and/or effective date.</P>

 <P style="margin-left:36.00pt;">for instance...if 2 are on hand<BR>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; 3 is the reorder level<BR>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; 10 is the order up to<BR><BR>then an item would qualify for 8 to be picked.</P>

The system will default this field from the Client Site Equipment record or, if blank, from the Site record, when a work order is created in New Call or via the Create PM Work Order function.  </P>
 <H3>9.4.2 Other Info Tab</H3>
 <P class="Reference_Line" style="margin-bottom:0.00pt;"><FONT style="font-weight:bold; " >New Field - Credit Hold<BR></FONT>This field is set  (during New Call or when the Create PM Workorder function is run) if any receivables exceed the number of Credit Hold Days for the Client referenced in the Job record. If a work order is placed on credit hold, it will not be visible on the dispatch board, and cannot be changed except by credit managers.</P>
 <P class="Reference_Line" style="margin-bottom:0.00pt;">To release the work order from Credit Hold, the credit manager should clear the Credit Hold box by double-clicking on it, and then click the Save button.  Once the work order has been released, it  will be visible on the dispatch board, and can be updated and assigned according to your firm’s usual procedures. </P>
 <H3>9.4.3 Evaluation Tab</H3>
 <P class="Reference_Line" style="margin-bottom:0.00pt;">If the Evaluation Id field is completed (on the Main tab of this Work Order), the system will generate lines to this tab when the Service Evaluation Wizard is run.  The Service Evaluation Wizard is invoked when a work order is completed or invoiced (depending upon the category of the questions being asked). The responses will be written to the Evaluation tab of the work order, and can be used to generate a numerical grade for the primary technician.  Evaluation questions will only be asked the first time a work order is set to completed or invoiced.</P>
 <H3>9.4.4 Invoicing Tab</H3>
 <P><IMG src="images/computetaxes.gif" border=0 height=28 width=94 alt="images\computetaxes.gif">  This button enables users to compute and manually edit sales tax computations prior to producing the invoice. It is designed to support certain special sales tax considerations.</P>
 <P>This button applies only to work orders whose default Job is flagged as Service Compute.  In addition, a registry entry enabling its use must be implemented.  If both of these requirements are met, clicking this button (after saving any changes to this work order) does the following:</P>
 <P>1.&nbsp; Deletes all existing WO Sales Tax lines that haven't been invoiced yet.<BR>2.&nbsp; Computes and auto-generates new lines on the Sales Tax tab.</P>
 <P>WO Sales Tax Lines that not yet been invoiced may be adjusted by the user as needed. </P>
 <H3>9.4.5 Sales Tax Tab</H3>
 <H3>Purpose:</H3>
 <P>This enhancement provides a means for users to compute and edit a Service Compute work order's sales tax computations prior to producing the invoice.&nbsp;Although the typical SAMPRO user will not require this tab, it may be employed to support certain special sales tax considerations.</P>
 <H3>Usage:</H3>
 <P>If this is the first time you are billing this job, click the Compute Tax button (on the Invoicing tab) to default in the Sales Tax Authority lines.  These lines may then be adjusted as needed.</P>
 <H3>Registry Entry:</H3>
 <P>See section 2.5 of these release notes.</P>
 <H3>Important Fields: </H3>
 <P><FONT style="font-weight:bold; " >Tax Authority Id: </FONT> <BR>The Tax Authority Id field(s) default (when you click the Compute Tax button) from the Sales Tax Group field in the Job record.  </P>
 <P><FONT style="font-weight:bold; " >Tax Base:</FONT> <BR>The amount to be taxed on this work order invoice.  </P>
 <P><FONT style="font-weight:bold; " >Rate: </FONT> <BR>The tax rate for this authority.  </P>
 <P><FONT style="font-weight:bold; " >Tax Amount:</FONT> <BR>By default, the system calculates this field as Tax Base X Rate. During manual entry/changes, automated tax amount calculations are performed whenever the user changes either the Tax Authority Id or the Tax Base.&nbsp; However, no auto-calc happens when the Tax Amount is changed.&nbsp; This gives the user a means of entering the exact dollar values they desire without SAMPRO overriding them.</P>
 <P><FONT style="font-weight:bold; " >Job Id:  Cost Code Id:</FONT> &nbsp;<FONT style="font-weight:bold; " >Billing Item Id:</FONT> <BR>The Job, Cost Code and Billing Items to which the sales tax is assigned. The system defaults these fields from the default work order job, but they may be changed. </P>
 <H3>9.4.6  Call Script Tab </H3>
 <H4>New Button</H4>
 <P class="Reference_Line" style="margin-bottom:0.00pt;"><IMG src="images/addcallscript.gif" border="0" height="28" width="48" alt="images\addcallscript.gif">  When you click the Add Call Script button (on the side button bar), the system will prompt you to enter a Call Script Id and Equipment Id. When you do so, and click OK, the system will insert the questions from the selected Call Script to the Call Script Tab.  The answers to this Call Script may then be entered by selecting the Call Script tab. </P>
 <H3>9.4.7  Technicians Tab</H3>
 <P>In previous releases, Insert with copy was only copying the Tech Id.  This functionality has been enhanced so that all fields except the date are copied – and the user is warned that this is the case. Note that the same technician should never be scheduled for the same date twice on the same WO. </P>
 <P><FONT style="font-weight:bold; " >Technician Id:<BR></FONT>In New Call, if you select a vendor technician whose insurance is out of date (and block payment is flagged), the system complains and will not let you choose the tech. In this release, the WO behavior is tightened down – you can no longer select a tech with blocked payments on a WO.</P>
 <P><IMG src="images/magnifybutton.gif" align=left border=0 height=16 width=16 alt="images\magnifybutton.gif"><FONT style="font-weight:bold; " > </FONT>The Technicians tab now has a full-screen view available.&nbsp; This view includes additional info from the Tech record, including the Vendor Id of subcontractor technicians. </P>
 <P><FONT style="font-weight:bold; " >New Field: PO #<BR></FONT>This new, display-only field has been added to allow recording and tracking of PO numbers by sub by WO.&nbsp;This enhancement supports the situation where multiple subcontractor technicians are listed on the same work order. A Purchase Order may be automatically generated for a subcontractor by New Call, Create PM Work Orders,  or by the Create PO for Sub button discussed below. </P>
 <P>The system will attempt to auto-populate the new column during data conversion.&nbsp; This is driven by the database revision level, not the SAMPRO version number.&nbsp; Any conversion where the 'old' revision level is 396 or less will have this process executed automatically.&nbsp;</P>
 <H4>New Buttons</H4>
 <P><IMG src="images/createpoforsub.gif" border="0" height="15" width="80" alt="images\createpoforsub.gif"> Clicking this button will create a new PO for the sub specified on the WO Tech line.&nbsp;&nbsp; Pushing the button does NOT open a PO viewer. Instead it causes a new PO to be created similar to those created from the New Call function. The system will warn you if you click the button for a Technician that is not a subcontractor, or it a PO has already been recorded for this line. </P>
 <P style="margin-left:36.00pt;"><FONT style="font-weight:bold; " >Important Note on Registry Entries:<BR></FONT>If your firm will be using this feature, a new registry option should be implemented that allows the user to 'undo' the current requirement that the WO Id and PO Ids match.&nbsp;This registry is discussed in these release notes. Another registry option automates the process of creating a PO for a subcontractor.  See sections 2.4 and 2.5 of these release notes for details. </P>
 <P class="Reference_Line" style="margin-bottom:0.00pt;"><IMG src="images/releaseline.gif" border="0" height="15" width="72" alt="images\releaseline.gif"> When the Release to Tech button is clicked, the line’’s status will be changed from Pending to the Default Status for the technician.  This status is designed for use with TechAnywhere. A work order can be created as pending, but not be sent to the technician’s wireless device until is released by the dispatcher.  When this option is implemented, all new wos for technicians with remote access will be created with a status of Pending.  See section 2.11.1 of these release notes for details.</P>
 <H3>9.4.8 Gross Margin Tab</H3>
 <P><FONT style="font-weight:bold; " >Field Removed: Invoice Approved?<BR></FONT>This field was recently added in version 6.1 for potential future use.  It has been removed since it is not implemented in version 6.2. </P>
 <H3>9.4.9 Labor Tab</H3>
 <P>The system now looks at the job cost category to see if it has any WC’s attached, and it so, chooses the one for the WC State in the Job record to override the Employee WC.&nbsp;</P>
 <P>The Job Billing Item, Client Site Equipment, and Flat Rate have been added to the list of fields that can be edited on WO Labor lines where the tech has been paid for the Payroll Period specified on the line.</P>
 <H3>9.4.10 Inventory Tab</H3>
 <P>Quote-type lines no longer post to GL since they never become Actual Job Costs.</P>
 <P><FONT style="font-weight:bold; " >Changed Field: Serial / Lot Id<BR></FONT>If a serialized Inventory Item is specified, double-clicking on the Serial / Lot Id field now displays a filtered list of all (used and unused) serial numbers for that item. In previous releases, the list included numbers for all serial and lot-controlled items. The Serial/Lot number may now be recorded on Inventory lines imported from job history. </P>

BillClerk’s line will be set to a status of wait paperwork. The scheduled date and time will be set when the escalation event is executed.  </P>
 <P class="Body_Text_Indent_3" style="margin-left:36.00pt;">A Dispatch Board containing the Tech Id ‘BillClerk’ would be set up for the Billing Clerk.  A similar scenario could be used to manage ‘waiting parts’ work orders. </P>

 <H3>9.14.1 Sales Tax Tab Enhancements</H3>
 <P class="Reference_Line" style="margin-bottom:0.00pt;">The WO/Job check list screen has been modified to indicate that the Sales Tax Amount has been manually entered in the WO.&nbsp; This is denoted by the presence of an 'M' to the right of the Tax Amount on each individual line.&nbsp; If the 'M' is not present, then the tax was computed the 'old' way and is not visible from within the WO viewer.</P>
 <P><FONT style="font-weight:bold; " >Note: </FONT>the system now prevents reprinting of invoice while post in progress, which could result in the double post of invoices.<FONT style="font-weight:bold; " > </FONT></P>

 <H3>9.15.1 Required Resource Processing</H3>
 <P class="Reference_Line" style="margin-bottom:0.00pt;">If Required Resource Processing is implemented on your system (either via a customization or registry entry), the Items listed on the Service Parts List specified on the PM Schedule will be written to the Required Resources tab of the work order.</P>
 <H3>9.15.2 Special processing of Service Parts List reinstated</H3>
 <P>The Filters - Pltd Filters - Belts and Other check boxes in the Client Site Equipment record PM tab are supposed to identify which Service Parts List items should be included in PM work orders. These boxes map to the Inventory Type Id in the Service Parts List viewer.</P>
 <P>SAM Pro uses special processing on the flagged Service Parts items based on whether the Tech assigned to the PM is a Subcontractor or not (as specified on the tech web access tab). This processing works as follows:</P>
 <P><FONT style="font-weight:bold; " >If the Technician is a Subcontractor:</FONT> the flagged parts list items will be added to the Work Requested field in the Work Order Equipment tab for the applicable piece of equipment. </P>
 <P><FONT style="font-weight:bold; " >If the Technician is NOT a Subcontractor:</FONT> the flagged parts list items are to be added to the Inventory or Other tab AND flagged as Quotes. Note that the Date Effective, Cost and Location will not be filled in.  If these parts are in fact used on the work order, these fields should be filled in and the quote flag removed when the work order is completed. </P>

 <H3>9.18.2&nbsp;TechAnywhere Features</H3>
 <P class="Reference_Line" style="margin-bottom:0.00pt;">A new WO Technician Status, Pending, has been created. This status is designed for use with TechAnywhere. A work order can be created as pending, but not be sent to the technician’s wireless device until is released by the dispatcher.  When this option is implemented, all new wo’s for technicians with remote access will be created with a status of Pending. </P>
 <P class="Reference_Line" style="margin-bottom:0.00pt;"><IMG src="images/releasewo.gif" border="0" height="28" width="48" alt="images\releasewo.gif"> When the Release to Tech button is clicked, the line’s status will be changed from Pending to the Default Status for the technician.  </P>
 <H3>9.18.3  Filter Tab</H3>

 <H2>9.19 Board Technician Viewer</H2>
 <P><FONT style="font-weight:bold; " >All Work Orders Option (Power Board Users)<BR></FONT>To display work orders for all technicians, create a Board Technician record with an Id in the upper section but NO technicians listed in the lower section.  When this Board Technician record is selected from the Dispatch Board’s Tech List tab, work orders for all technicians (and unassigned work orders) will appear in the Work Order list.  The Work Order Summary (in the upper section of the Dispatch Board) will display only two lines – for Unassigned Work Orders and All Work Orders. </P>
 <H2>9.20 Scheduled Event Viewer</H2>

 <H2>9.21 TechFinder Viewer</H2>
 <P>In previous releases, the TechFinder Scheduled Hours grid included hours for work orders lines that were set to the following statuses:  On Break, onsite, scheduled, travel, unacknowledged, waiting service, waiting quote.  The status of ‘completed’ has been added to this list. </P>
 <H2>9.22 Renew Service Contracts: </H2>
 <P>This function no longer advances the Job Date Open field by one year. Only the Date Closed (if initially set) is now adjusted. </P>
 <H2>9.23  Service Billing Worksheet</H2>
 <P>This function now supports negative value lines (meant to reduce revenue).  </P>
 <H2>9.24. Start Work Order Batch Closed</H2>
 <P>This function has been changed so that only Work Orders that are Cancelled or Billed will be eligible for closure. A new field, Closed Date, has been added to the Range screen to enable you to specify a default Date Closed for the Work Order if all the Date Scheduled fields on the Work Order’s Technician tab are blank. In addition, an entry to the Work Order’s Change Log will now be made when the Work Order is closed. </P>
 <H2>9.25  Start Purge Scheduled Events</H2>
 <P>By default, this function has been altered so that it now operates as follows: </P>
 <P>1. Determine the Purge Thru date by applying the DaysToSave setting (if this registry setting has DaysToSave=# not been made, 60 days will be used) to the current system date. </P>
 <P>2. Purge ALL cancelled and executed events THAT ARE NOT WORK ORDER RELATED.</P>
 <P>3. For Work Order Related Events: only purge those Scheduled Events belonging to Work Orders whose WO Escalation Status is set to Cancelled or Billed AND whose Date Closed makes it eligible for the purge.</P>
 <P>4. When the purge is run, the Escalation Profile Rn will be dropped from Work Orders who’s Events were purged. This is done to prevent the creation of undesirable new escalation events if someone edits a 'closed' work order. </P>
 <P>&nbsp;A registry setting is available to restore the previous behavior:</P>
 <P><FONT style="font-weight:bold; " >&nbsp;RetainAllEventsForOpenWOs=false </FONT></P>
 <P>&nbsp;This registry entry is<FONT style="font-weight:bold; " > NOT</FONT> recommended. If implemented, the following behavior will be in effect: </P>
 <P style="margin-left:36.00pt;">1. Determine the Purge Thru date by applying the DaysToSave setting to the current system date.<BR>2. Purge ALL cancelled and executed events regardless of work order status.&nbsp;<BR>3. If IncludeClosedWorkOrders is True, eliminate all remaining events for closed work orders.&nbsp; An example would be a contingent Alarm that never went 'active' and has an Event Status of OnHold.<BR>4. Clear the Escalation Profile Rn for qualifying 'closed' work orders.&nbsp; This is done to prevent the creation of additional escalation events in the event someone edits a 'closed' work order</P>

 <H1>12 Web</H1>
 <H2>12.1 Important Change</H2>
 <P>Before version 6.2, the Technician and Web Security records controlled web access and structure. Although these records are still supported, the new Web User and Web Profile records are preferred. </P>
 <H2>12.2 Web Profile Viewer</H2>
 <H2>Purpose:</H2>
 <P class="Reference_Line" style="margin-bottom:0.00pt;">This record enables you to construct a ‘profile’ that will enable your web users to only ‘see’ those sites that they should be able to access.  This record also enables you to implement custom web graphics and CRMAnywhere formatting. </P>
 <H2>Usage:</H2>
 <P>Referenced in records:  Client Site, Web User. </P>
 <P>The Web Profile Viewer supersedes the older Web Security record. Although version 6.2 supports both Web Profiles and Web Security, you are strongly urged to migrate to the Web Profile/Web User standard. </P>
 <H2>Example:</H2>
 <P>Typically, a Web Profile record would be made for a logical group of Web Users. For example, if your firm serves BigBank customers, you would create a Web Profile, BigBank, for CRMAnywhere users from BigBank. If BigBank had branches in several regions, you might create a Web Profile for each region, or create one BigBank profile, and define the regions/area via the custom values. You would then create a Web User record for each BigBank customer, specifying which BigBank Sites this user could access.  For example, a BigBank branch manager would be restricted (in the Web User record) to only his store, while a BigBank area manager would be able to view information on all branches in her district.  Click <A href="web_users_viewer.htm">Web Users Viewer</A>  for further information.</P>

 <H3>12.4.4 Open Work Orders Page</H3>
 <P>Instead of grouping the Open Requests by Site, the Site information has been incorporated into the columns.  Sort by Column functionality (either ascending or descending) has been added for all columns.</P>
 <P>In previous releases, open work orders were excluded if the date created is more then &quot;DaysHistoryLimit&quot; set in the web-settings registry. In this release, this constraint is dropped by default: there will not be any age control on open work orders. To restore the original behavior, an option to the web-settings registry entry is available as detailed in section 2.9.2 of these release notes</P>
 <H3>12.4.5  New Page: Site View</H3>
 <P>A new page, Site View, has been added that will display all Open Weblogs and Work Orders, Completed &amp; Invoiced WOs, and Quotes for that Site. All tables on this page support sort able columns. This new page will, for example, enable a district manager to view all documents associated with a specific store from a singe page. All CRM-viewable documents may be accessed from the applicable WO or Quote.  A  &quot;Download Abobe&quot; button has been added to the attachment pages for the convenience of your customers. </P>
 <P><FONT style="font-family:'Tahoma'; color:black; " >A new banner, siteview.gif, will be required for this page. This file should be in the same format as your firms other banners (e.g, main_menu.gif or manage_quotes.gif) but should include a title such as Site View or Store View that will be most meaningful to your customers. </FONT></P>
 <H3>12.4.6  Completed Work Order Page</H3>
