<h1>Job Cost Code Viewer</h1>
<h2>Purpose:</h2>
<p>Create and maintain the job-specific cost codes that your company uses 
 to track costing information. Refer to the <a href="Job_Overview.htm">Job 
 Overview</a> for information on related records and procedures.</p>
<h2>Usage:</h2>
<p>Required for job costing. At least one job-specific cost code must be 
 created for each job.</p>
<p>Job Cost Codes attached to Job Template records may only be edited by 
 users with access to Job Templates via their User Groups.</p>
<p>PM (Project Manager) filtering has been applied to these records; only 
 those Job Cost Codes corresponding to the user’s PM Filter may be selected.</p>
<h3>Registry:</h3>
<p><a href="Registry_Entry_Global_Settings__Column_Compression__Dispatch_Board_Rows__History_Log_Inventory_Markup.htm#Registry_Entry_Global_Settings_Completed_JC">Registry 
 to Prevent Selection of Completed Cost Codes / Billing Items</a></p>
<p>Allow the user to set the Date Completed in the Job&#39;s Cost Codes and 
 Billing Items when the user sets the Date Closed in the Job Record (see 
 <a href="Registry_Entry_Job_and_Job_Cloning.htm">Job Registry</a>).</p>

<h3>Important Fields:</h3>
<p><font style="font-weight: bold;">Note:</font> this Help Topic lists 
 the standard configuration of all fields that may be included in this 
 record. If you are using a customized system, the fields displayed on 
 your screen may not exactly match the order or status (required, optional, 
 default, display-only, hidden, etc.) of the fields described in this Topic.</p>
<p class="Tab">Main Tab:</p>
<p><font style="font-weight: bold;">Job Cost Code Id:</font> (30 character, 
 only . and - special characters)<br/>
This alphanumeric field must uniquely identify this Cost Code for this 
 Job Id. For example, Job 100 and Job 200 could each have a Job Cost Code 
 with the Id &quot;materials&quot;.</p>
<p><font style="font-weight: bold;">Job Cost Code Name:</font> (40 character)<br/>
Optional. Briefly describes this Job Cost Code.</p>
<p><font style="font-weight: bold;">Office Field</font><br/>
By default, this field is set to Office. If this job code always (or almost 
 always) pertains to labor completed in the office, retain the Office option. 
 If this cost code usually pertains to work done at a job site, select 
 Field (by double-clicking on its radio button).</p>
<p>The system uses these fields to default the Payroll Tax Authorities 
 in Payroll Adjustment and Labor journal entries. If this cost code is 
 marked office, the system looks at the State and Local Tax Authorities 
 in the Employee record to determine the physical location of the employee 
 when he was working on a job. If the cost code is marked field <font style="font-weight: bold;">and</font> 
 the employee is flagged as a field employee, the system looks at the State 
 and Local Tax Authorities in the Job record to determine the physical 
 location of the employee when he was working on a job.</p>
<p><font style="font-weight: bold;">Job Id:</font><br/>
The Job this Cost Code is being created for. This field is required since 
 cost codes are job-specific. If the user changes the Job Id in an existing 
 record, the viewer will change to ‘add’ mode to allow the cost code be 
 ‘cloned’ for the new job if it does not already exist.</p>
<p><font style="font-weight: bold;">GL Entity Id:</font><br/>
If your firm departmentalizes or uses Intercompany processing, enter the 
 GL Entity Id that expenses and income for this cost code are charged to 
 (double-click or press Alt+F7 to select from a list of GL Entities). This 
 field defaults from the GL Entity in the Job record (if one was filled 
 in) if you are manually creating this record. If this record was created 
 using a Job Template, it defaulted from the Cost Code associated with 
 the template Job.</p>
<p>When <a href="Intercompany_Processing_Overview.htm">Intercompany Processing</a> 
 is enabled, the GL Entities specified in the Job record MUST reference 
 the same Company as the GL Entities specified in its Cost Codes. Validation 
 will not allow the GL Entity to be changed to one referencing a different 
 Company.</p>
<p><font style="font-weight: bold;">Billing Item Id:</font><br/>
Optional. The default Job Billing Item this Cost Code should be associated 
 with for invoicing purposes. Note that each Job Billing Item may have 
 multiple Job Cost Codes. If a <a href="Registry_Job_Cost_Code.htm">Job Cost Code Registry</a> 
 is enabled, the user will be warned if this field is changed when Job 
 Progress lines referencing it exists. </p>
<p><font style="font-weight: bold;">Hrly Burden:</font><br/>
Optional for Cost Codes associated with labor. This field should only be 
 used if you wish to have a different overhead burden for each Cost Code. 
 Otherwise, the Burden should be locked into the Employee&#39;s Earnings Tab. 
 If completed, this rate should include the general and administrative 
 expenses associated with this category of labor.</p>
<p><font style="font-weight: bold;">GL Income:</font><br/>
Required. This income account will be used for posting T&amp;M lines to 
 the Sales Journal by Automated Invoicing if a GL Income Account is <font style="font-weight: bold;">not</font> specified in the Job Cost Category 
 selected on that line. If the Job Cost Category specifies an Income Account, 
 it will be used instead.</p>
<p><font style="font-weight: bold;">Cost Code Group:</font>  <font style="font-weight: bold;">Cost Code Level2 Id:</font><br/>
If this level of costing is implemented on your system, enter an appropriate 
 Id or double-click to select from a list of Id&#39;s.</p>
<p><font style="font-weight: bold;">Discipline Id:</font><br/>
If Discipline records are included in your job cost reporting system (typically 
 for union payroll), enter the Discipline Id this Labor-related Job Cost 
 Code pertains to.</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: bold;">Skill 
 Id</span><br/>
Skill records allow for more detailed Job Cost coding in Reports and KPIs. 
 This field is for reporting only: it is not NOT written to Job History 
 (or other History records) when an entry for this Job Cost Code is posted.</p>
<p><font style="font-weight: bold;">Estimated Cost:  Estimated 
 Revenue:<br/>
</font>The estimated cost and revenue associated with this code, for reporting 
 purposes.</p>
<p><font style="font-weight: bold;">Certified PR Report?</font><br/>
Check this field (by double-clicking or pressing the Spacebar) if labor 
 charges to this job should be included on the Certified Payroll report.</p>
<p style="margin-left: 36.00pt;"><font style="font-weight: bold;" color="#000080">Tip:</font> 
 <font color="#000080"><br/>
</font>If a single job will incur labor that requires certified reporting 
 as well as labor that does not require certified reporting, set up multiple 
 labor cost codes, some of which have the Certified Payroll box checked, 
 and some which do not.</p>
<p style="margin-left: 8px;"><span style="font-weight: bold;">CIP 
 Discount?</span><span style="mso-list: l0 level1 lfo1;"><br/>
This field should be flagged if the CIP Discount Percent in the Job record 
 should be applied to discounts for non-wage labor (burden) costs posted 
 to this Job Cost Code.</span></p>
<p style="margin-left: 48px;"><span style="mso-list: l0 level1 lfo1; 
	 font-weight: bold;">Version 9.1 and Above:</span> <span style="mso-list: l0 level1 lfo1;">This 
 version refines the handling of this field. If the CIP Discount box is 
 flagged in the applicable Earnings record and in this Job Cost Code record, 
 the CIP Discount Percent in the Job record will be applied to discounts 
 the non-wage labor (burden) cost posted to this Job Cost Code.</span> 
 In the original implementation, all N/A-type earnings were subject to 
 CIP Discounting.  </p>
<p style="margin-left: 48px; mso-list: l0 level1 lfo1;"><span style="font-weight: bold;">NOTE:</span> use of this feature requires 
 that the global registry option <a href="Registry_Entry_Global_Settings__Column_Compression__Dispatch_Board_Rows__History_Log_Inventory_Markup.htm#Refine_Job_Cost_Calculation_for_Labor_">LaborJobCostRateMethod</a> 
 is set to New.  </p>
<p><font style="font-weight: bold;">Default for AR Post?</font><br/>
Check this field if sales tax and miscellaneous charges should be applied 
 to this cost code.  In general, only one Cost Code per Job should 
 be flagged. Record Billing Adjustments (for construction invoices), Service 
 Invoices, and Recurring PM&#39;s (using the Accelerated Payment Technology 
 to bill via credit card)  all use the cost code with this <span style="text-indent: 30.25pt;">when 
 the tax lines for the AR Sales Journal are generated.  If more than 
 one Cost Code exists for the selected Job, but none are flagged as Default 
 for AR Post, the system will simply select one.</span></p>
<p><font style="font-weight: bold;">Date Must Start:  Date Must 
 Complete:<br/>
</font>These informational fields are used to indicate when work associated 
 with this cost code should be started/completed.</p>
<p><font style="font-weight: bold;">Date Started: Date Completed:</font><br/>
The Date Completed field is referenced when entering labor, material or 
 other charges to this Cost Code. If the Effective Date of the entry exceeds 
 the Date Completed, the system will warn you of the problem (but will 
 not prevent the transaction from being saved). The Date Started field 
 provides optional information for planning and scheduling purposes. Enter 
 the date in <font style="font-style: italic;">mmddyyyy</font> format or 
 double-click on this field to access the calendar viewer to do so.</p>
<p>A registry setting may be enabled to allow the user to set the Date 
 Completed in the Job&#39;s Cost Codes and Billing Items when the user sets 
 the Date Closed in the Job record (see <a href="Registry_Entry_Job_and_Job_Cloning.htm">Job 
 Registry</a>).</p>

<p><font style="font-weight: bold;">Job Cost Code User1: Job Cost Code 
 User2:</font> (30 character x 2)<br/>
Optional, user-defined fields.</p>
<p style="font-weight: bold;">Job Cost 
 Category Usage Filter<span style="font-weight: normal;"><br/>
 This field allows the user to filter which Cost Categories are eligible 
 for selection when this Cost Code is entered in certain journals and records. 
 </span></p>
<p style="font-weight: bold; margin-left: 48px;">Important:<span style="font-weight: normal;"> We strongly suggest conferring with 
 your support representative if your firm wishes to begin using this functionality. 
 The validations imposed by its use are NOT supported by the Quote Manager 
 Approval Wizard; if improper Cost Categories are selected, the post will 
 fail.</span> </p>
<p style="font-weight: bold;"><span style="font-weight: normal;">When 
 the user specifies this Cost Code in a detail line (i.e, for a Job Journal 
 entry), the contents of this Usage Filter will automatically be added 
 to the Cost Cat: range of the Job Cost Category filter preceded by sql=. 
  This special filtering  is in addition to any Job Cost Category 
 filtering implemented for that specific journal or record.</span></p>
<p><img src="assets/images/image12.jpg" alt="" style="border: none;" width="690" height="468" border="0"/></p>
<p><img src="assets/images/TestFilter.bmp" alt="" style="border: none;" border="0"/> Click the Test Filter 
 button to preview the results of the Cost Category Usage field. The Cost 
 Category list will be opened pre-filtered to the contents of the Cost 
 Category Usage field.</p>
<p style="margin-left: 48px;"><span style="font-weight: bold;">TechAnywhere 
 Note:</span> These Cost Code ~ Cost Category Usage Validations are currently 
 disabled for TechAnywhere Posts.  In the labor Journal, cost category 
 restrictions have been refined  to tolerate TechAnywhere posts to 
 the Labor Journal.</p>
<p style="margin-left: 48px;"><span style="font-weight: bold;">Quote 
 Manager Note:</span> The Quote may not &#39;know&#39; what cost code (or even 
 what Job) will be selected until the wizard is run; the Approval Wizard 
 does NOT currently support this validation. If improper Categories are 
 selected, the post will fail.</p>
<p style="margin-left: 48px;"><a href="Registry_Entry_Job_Journal.htm">Job 
 Journal Registry</a> to Change the Cost Code ~ Cost Category Validation 
 Error into a Warning.</p>
<p style="margin-left: 8px;"><font style="font-weight: bold;">Obsolete?<br/>
</font>If this field is checked, the record is considered Obsolete, and 
 it may not be directly specified during data-entry (either by entering 
 the Id or selecting it from a list). Obsoleted records can be edited and 
 the Obsolete option can be cleared when necessary.</p>
<p><font style="font-weight: bold;">Security Id:</font><br/>
If multiple location security is implemented on your centralized database 
 system, this informational field displays the Security Id of the local 
 user that created this record. If multiple location security is not implemented 
 on your system, or if this record was created by a global user, this field 
 will be blank.</p>
<p> </p>
<p class="Tab">GMP Tab</p>
<p style="margin-left: 8px;"><span style="font-weight: bold;">GMP 
 %:</span><br/>
 This field is used to calculate the add-on fee for GMP jobs. It should 
 be completed for Job Cost Codes used for GMP Fees. It should NOT be completed 
 for Job Cost Codes used for GMP Revenue Adjustments. Fees are calculated 
 when Start Compute GMP Special Revenue is run as a scheduled event or 
 when Record Billing Adjustments is run.</p>
<p style="margin-left: 8px;"><span style="font-weight: bold;">Cost 
 Cat:</span><br/>
 This field should only be completed if it is for a Job Cost Code which 
 will be used in GMP Revenue Adjustment/Over Contract JCH entries. The 
 Cost Category should have a Posting Cost Type &amp; a Selection Cost Type 
 of Other.</p>
<p style="font-weight: bold; margin-left: 8px;">Filters: 
  </p>
<p style="margin-left: 48px;"><span style="font-weight: bold;">Skills 
 - Disciplines - Cost Category</span><br/>
If these filters are blank, the GMP % in this record will always be applied. 
 If one or more of these filters is completed, they will be used to limit 
 the GMP % revenue calculations.</p>
