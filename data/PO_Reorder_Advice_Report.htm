<h1>PO Reorder Advice Report</h1>
<h2>Purpose:</h2>
<p>This report identifies which of your stocked items have fallen below 
 the restock level and should be reordered.</p>
<p>The PO Reorder Advice Report will exclude locations not specified for 
 Reorder Advice reporting in the Location record. The ‘Include on Reorder 
 Advice Report&quot; field in the Location record must be checked for a 
 location to be included on this report. Truck locations would typically 
 have their Include on Reorder Advice Report box cleared.</p>
<h2>Registry Entry:</h2>
<p><a href="Registry_Report_Reorder_Advice.htm">Registry Report Reorder 
 Advice</a> (show the Site name on the report)</p>
<h2>Report Description:</h2>
<p>For each inventory item that needs to be reordered, the report lists 
 the Inventory Id and Name, the Primary Vendor, Buyer, Standard Container, 
 Lead Time, Last Cost, and Last Source. The 6 Month Usage field is calculated 
 based on Client Orders picked within the last 6 months. The Turns field 
 will be calculated if Compute Corporate Metrics is in use. </p>
<p>For each Location, the Quantity Needed is displayed as follows:</p>
<p>Min/Max + Pick + Customer BO + Shop BO - On Hand - On Order = Needed</p>
<p style="margin-left: 36.00pt;"><font style="font-weight: bold;">A Note 
 on</font> <font style="font-weight: bold;">Min/Max</font></p>
<p style="margin-left: 36.00pt;">The quantity needed is calculated based 
 on the Order Up to field in the Inventory Item record (for a specified 
 location) and how many items (if any) are already on order. Items will 
 not be considered to be needed unless (On Hand + On Order) &lt; Reorder 
 Level.</p>
<p style="margin-left: 66.25pt;">- If an item is needed, the Maximum of 
 the Reorder/Order Up to will be displayed in the Min/Max field.</p>
<p style="margin-left: 66.25pt;">- If an item is NOT needed, the Minimum 
 (Reorder Level) will be displayed.</p>
<p style="margin-left: 66.25pt;"><font style="font-weight: bold; text-decoration: underline; ">Example 
 1: an item is needed<br/>
</font>Suppose widget001 has a Reorder Level of 20, an Order Up To of 25, 
 and that 9 are On Hand and 7 are on order. In this case the Min/Max field 
 will be 25 and the Needed field would be calculated as follows:</p>
<p style="margin-left: 66.25pt;"> Need=Order Up To - (On Hand + On 
 Order) = 25 - (9 + 7) = 9</p>
<p style="margin-left: 66.25pt;"><font style="font-weight: bold; text-decoration: underline; ">Example 
 2: an item is not needed<br/>
</font>Suppose widget001 has a Reorder Level of 20, an Order Up To of 25, 
 and that 14 are On Hand and 7 are on order. In this case the Min/Max field 
 will be 20 and the Needed field would be 0 because On Hand + On Order 
 (21) exceed the Reorder level.</p>
<p><font style="font-weight: bold;">Multinational Currency</font> <font style="font-weight: bold;">Support</font><font style="font-weight: bold;">:<br/>
</font> If multinational currency is implemented on your system (see <a href="Currency_Master_Record.htm">Currency Master Record</a> for details), 
 all costs will appear on this report converted to your local currency 
 EXCEPT for an informational field that has been added. If an item was 
 last purchased from a foreign supplier (with the Currency Id field completed 
 in their Vendor record), the last cost of the item in the foreign currency 
 will be printed directly below the Lost Cost field (shown in terms of 
 your local currency).</p>
<h2>Important Fields:</h2>
<p><font style="font-weight: bold;">Report Options:</font><br/>
The Report Options selector pane controls how the report will be output. 
 Click <a href="Report_Options.htm">Report Options</a> to learn more.</p>
<p><font style="font-weight: bold;">Range:</font><br/>
Enter a unique, alphanumeric name to save and identify your customized 
 report Range. Ranges are defined by the contents of the ID field(s).</p>
<p style="margin-left: 36.00pt;"><font style="font-weight: bold;" color="#0000FF">Hint:</font> 
 You can create user-defined report ranges that are available to all users 
 with access to that report. To do so, the first character of the named 
 range should be an asterisk. Named ranges beginning with an asterisk will 
 appear on all users&#39; report ranges options so that they can be selected 
 (but not altered) by any user with access to that report. Only the user 
 that created the report range is allowed to alter it.</p>
<p><font style="font-weight: bold;">Sort By User Id</font>?<br/>
If you flag this field (by double-clicking on it or pressing the Spacebar 
 when the caret is positioned on it), this report will be sorted by the 
 User Id field in the Inventory Item record. If this box is not checked, 
 the report will be ordered by the primary Vendor Id, then by Inventory 
 Item id.</p>
<p><font style="font-weight: bold;">Sort By Inventory Group Id</font><font style="font-weight: bold;">?</font><font style="font-weight: bold;"><br/>
</font>If this option is selected, the report will be sorted by Vendor 
 Id, then by Inventory Group id, and finally by Inventory Item Id.</p>
<p><font style="font-weight: bold;">On Order Is Avble:<br/>
</font>When this option is checked, the &#39;quantity available&#39; includes PO 
 orders that haven&#39;t yet been received.</p>
<p><font style="font-weight: bold;">R</font><font style="font-weight: bold;">estrict 
 to Location</font> <font style="font-weight: bold;">Filter</font> <font style="font-weight: bold;">Only</font><font style="font-weight: bold;">?<br/>
</font>If you check this field (by double-clicking on it or pressing the 
 Spacebar when the caret is positioned on it), the items on this report 
 will be restricted to those needed at locations defined by the Location 
 Id: range. Other stock locations that have the item available for possible 
 transfer will NOT appear on the report if this box is checked.</p>
<p><font style="font-weight: bold;">Inventory Item Id:</font><br/>
If you only wish to print this report for a specific Inventory Id, enter 
 its Id. Several Items may be listed by entering their Id&#39;s separated by 
 commas (P2323,P56435,T64345). A range of Items can be defined by the first 
 and last items of the range separated by an underscore (P1001_P2000).</p>
<p><font style="font-weight: bold;">Location Id:</font><br/>
To print this report for a specific location, enter its Id (or double-click 
 to select from a list). Several Locations can be specified by entering 
 their Id&#39;s separated by commas (1005,1007,1020). A range of Locations 
 can be defined by the first and last items of the range separated by an 
 underscore (1010_1015).</p>
<p style="margin-left: 36.00pt;"><font style="font-weight: bold;">Important 
 Note:</font> If you filter on location(s), items needed at that location 
 will appear on the report (flagged with a ** next to the Location), along 
 with a listing of all other stock locations that have the item available 
 (for possible transfer).</p>
<p style="margin-left: 36.00pt;">However, if the Restrict to Location Filter 
 Only box is checked, only items needed at the Locations defined by this 
 range will be listed: other stock locations that have the item available 
 for possible transfer will NOT appear on the report.</p>
<p><font style="font-weight: bold;">User Id:</font><br/>
To limit this report to Inventory Items assigned to a specific User, enter 
 the User Id (or double-click to select from a list).</p>
<p><font style="font-weight: bold;">Manufactured</font><br/>
To limit this report to Inventory Items flagged as Manufactured, enter 
 a Y in this range field.</p>
<p><font style="font-weight: bold;">Stocked:<br/>
</font>The default value of the range is set to <font style="font-weight: bold;">Y</font> 
 so that only items flagged as Stocked will be listed. To show all items, 
 the range field may be cleared. To show only items whose Stocked field 
 is blank, enter <font style="font-weight: bold;">N</font> in the Stocked 
 range and then run the report.</p>
<p style="margin-left: 36.00pt;"><font style="font-weight: bold;">Reporting 
 Tips:</font></p>
<p style="margin-left: 36.00pt;"><font style="font-weight: bold;">Multiple 
 Fields</font><br/>
You can optionally enter Id&#39;s in more than one field. Items will appear 
 on the report only if they fit all the criteria set in the ID fields.</p>
<p style="margin-left: 66.25pt;"><font style="font-weight: bold;">Example:</font> 
 Assume the first ID field is for Inventory Items, and the second is for 
 Locations. Let&#39;s suppose you set these fields as follows:</p>
<p style="margin-left: 66.25pt;">d0001_d9999</p>
<p style="margin-left: 66.25pt;">1004_1020</p>
<p style="margin-left: 66.25pt;">A stocked inventory item (with quantity 
 needed &gt; 0) would appear on the report only if its Inventory Item Id 
 is within the range d0001 to d9999 <font style="font-weight: bold;">and</font> 
 it exists at locations between 1004 and 1020.</p>
<p style="margin-left: 36.00pt;">You may also use comparison operators 
 in your report ranges to control the information output to your report.
