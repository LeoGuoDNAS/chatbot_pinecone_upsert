<h1>Inventory / PO Receipt Journal</h1>
<h2>Purpose:</h2>
<p>Log receipt of items on Vendor Purchase Orders.</p>
<p>Record a COP Dropship order for Invoicing (see <a href="Registry_Entry_Global_Settings__Column_Compression__Dispatch_Board_Rows__History_Log_Inventory_Markup.htm#global_settings_receive_dropship_IRJ">Global 
 Registry to Receive COP Dropship on Inventory Receipt Journal</a> for 
 a registry entry to enable).</p>
<p>Correcting entries to existing transactions can also be made.</p>
<p style="margin-left: 36.00pt;"><font style="font-weight: bold;">WARNING: 
 Un-receiving and Re-receiving Items received to Jobs / Work Orders:<br/>
</font>If it is necessary to ‘un-receive’ an item (by zeroing out the received 
 quantity) in order to change the underlying purchase order, always re-receive 
 the item to a <span style="font-weight: bold;">NEW</span> Inventory Receipts 
 Journal entry. Reusing an existing entry can lead to problems in JCH.</p>
<p>Example:</p>
<p>Create a transaction logging the receipt of 3 widgets ordered on PO 
 1044.<br/>
Correct a transaction that incorrectly logged the receipt of 5 gizmos (instead 
 of 6) ordered on PO 1023.</p>
<h2>Usage:</h2>
<p><span>Un-receipted lines are no longer displayed in existing journal 
 entries to prevent the user from re-receipting in the same entry. This 
 enforces the requirement to create a new Inventory Receipt entry to re-receipt 
 the items.</span></p>
<p class="Support"></p>
<p>The Inventory Receipts Journal and the history records it generates 
 assume the Security Id of the Purchase Order used to generate them.</p>
<p>Items received are automatically posted to Inventory as On Hand unless 
 Quality Control is specified in which case the status is set to In Testing. 
 If you receive a partial shipment, a new transaction should be created 
 when the remaining items are received.</p>
<p><font style="font-weight: bold;">Serialized Items:</font> When un-receiving 
 a serialized item, validation ensures that the item is at the original 
 receiving location; the user will be warned that the line’s quantity cannot 
 be changed if it is not there. In order to successfully ‘unreceive’ the 
 item, an inventory adjustment journal entry must first be made, transferring 
 it back to its original receiving location.</p>
<p>The following procedure may be employed to re-receive a serialized item:</p>
<p style="margin-left: 48px;">1. Access the View Lot Master record for 
 the serialized item to be re-received.</p>
<p style="margin-left: 88px;">Verify that the Quantity on Hand = 0.</p>
<p style="margin-left: 88px;">Change the Lot Status to Reuse S/N.</p>
<p style="margin-left: 88px;">Save the record.</p>
<p style="margin-left: 48px;"><span>2. Create a new Inventory Receipt entry 
 to re-receive the item. You will be warned that the serial number already 
 existed but you will be allowed to save the Inventory Receipt.</span></p>
<p><font style="font-weight: bold;">Changes to Previously Vouchered Items:</font> 
 Validation prevents vouchered items from being ‘unreceived’. The system 
 will not let you change the received quantity of a vouchered item.</p>
<p>Users are allowed to un-receive partially vouchered purchases as long 
 as a line’s total received is not less than the total vouchered.</p>
<p style="font-weight: bold;">When Unvouchered Payables is Enabled</p>
<p style="font-weight: normal;"><font><span style="font-weight: normal;"><a data-target="POPUP584951079" data-rhwidget="DropSpot" href="#" class="dropspot"><span data-open-text="true" data-skip-index="true">Click 
 for Details</span><span data-close-text="true">Click 
 for Details</span></a> for used this function when Unvouchered 
 AP is enabled in the Accounting Period.</span></font></p>
<div data-targetname="POPUP584951079">
	<p>Since G/L entries post at the time of P.O. Receipt, it is important 
	 that the P.O. is vouchered in A/P with information that consistently 
	 reflects what the P.O. was at the time of receipt. To ensure that 
	 this is the case, system validations enforce the following procedures.</p>
	<p style="margin-left: 36.00pt;">1. A P.O. Line may not be changed 
	 once receipts have occurred for the item on the line. Edits may be 
	 done to lines that have not had receipt transactions recorded to them.</p>
	<p style="margin-left: 36.00pt;">2. If an A/P invoice reflects pricing 
	 that is different from the P.O the edit should be performed in A/P 
	 Journal at the time of vouchering. The postings for such edits is 
	 properly handled by the A/P Journal.</p>
	<p style="margin-left: 36.00pt;">3. If it is determined that received 
	 items were ordered to an incorrect G/L account this edit should also 
	 occur in A/P Journal. The procedure to this edit will be to:<br/>
	- Import the P.O. to the A/P Journal<br/>
	- ACCEPT the G/L value from the P.O.<br/>
	- ADD the transactions, then edit the G/L Account and<br/>
	- SAVE the edited transaction</p>
	<p style="margin-left: 36.00pt;">4. In cases where the P.O. MUST be 
	 changed, the receipt transaction may be &quot;undone&quot; prior to 
	 editing the P.O. Line as long as no A/P transactions <font style="font-family: Tahoma; 
	 font-size: 10pt;" face="Tahoma" size="2">have been recorded for the 
	 item.</font></p>
	<p style="margin-left: 36.00pt;"><font style="font-weight: bold;">Note:</font> 
	 in order for Unvouchered Payables to be handled correctly when quantities 
	 are received, the Unvouchered Payable GL accounts must be entered 
	 in all applicable Inventory Group records.</p></div>
<h2>Registry:</h2>
<p><font style="font-weight: bold;"><span style="font-weight: normal;">See 
 the <a href="Registry_Entry_Inventory_Receipts_Journal.htm">Inventory 
 Receipts Registry</a> for entries to control how PO lines are added, adjust 
 the date or period for automated TechAnywhere entries,</span> <span style="font-weight: normal;">disable 
 the Summary Tab,</span> <span style="font-weight: normal;">and more.</span><br/>
</font></p>
<h2>Important Fields:</h2>
<p>This viewer is divided into two sections. The upper section contains 
 the basic transaction header information. The lower section displays the 
 transaction item detail.</p>
<p><font style="font-weight: bold;">Note:</font> this Help Topic lists 
 the standard configuration of all fields that may be included in this 
 record. If you are using a customized system, the fields displayed on 
 your screen may not exactly match the order or status (required, optional, 
 default, display-only, hidden, etc.) of the fields described in this Topic.</p>
<p> </p>
<p class="Tab"><span>Main Tab</span></p>
<p><font style="font-weight: bold;">Purchase Order Id:</font><br/>
If you are creating a new transaction, enter the PO Id for the items received 
 or press Alt-F7 (or double-click on this field) to select from a list 
 of PO&#39;s. This field is required. When you select a PO, items and quantities 
 Ordered and Previously Received for this PO will appear in the lower section 
 of the screen.</p>
<p>Note: if you are adjusting an existing transaction, the PO Id field 
 will be filled in when you select a Transaction Id to adjust.</p>
<p><font style="font-weight: bold;">Date Received:</font><br/>
This field defaults to today’s date. It must fall within the Start and 
 End Dates of the Accounting Period.</p>
<p><font style="font-weight: bold;">Period Id:</font><br/>
The Accounting Period is required.  The Date Received must fall within 
 the Accounting Period Start and End Dates.</p>
<p><font style="font-weight: bold;">Transaction Description</font><br/>
Optional. Briefly describes this transaction for internal use.</p>
<p><font style="font-weight: bold;">Import Entry #:</font><font style="font-weight: bold;"><br/>
</font>If these items were imported, complete this field. For Lot Controlled 
 items, the Import Entry Number field is copied into the new Lot Master 
 record when it is created.</p>
<p><font style="font-weight: bold;">Transaction Id:</font><br/>
The system will generate a transaction Id for you when you save or change 
 this record. If an order is received in several partial shipments, each 
 partial shipment should be handled as a new transaction.</p>
<p>If you are changing an existing transaction to correct an error, the 
 correcting transaction will be assigned a consecutive number based on 
 the original number when it is saved (e.g., 1012 and 1012-01). The display-only 
 Previous Id and Next Id fields indicate if correcting entries exist for 
 the current transaction.</p>
<p><font style="font-weight: bold;">Billable Freight:<br/>
</font>COP Invoicing has been enhanced to obtain the freight charge from 
 this field, if completed. It will appear on the COP Invoice Registry entries 
 (see <a href="Registry_Entry_Global_Settings__Column_Compression__Dispatch_Board_Rows__History_Log_Inventory_Markup.htm#global_settings_receive_dropship_IRJ">Global 
 Registry Receive Drop-shipped COP Orders</a>) are required to receive 
 COP Dropship Orders is this journal.</p>
<p><img src="assets/images/image/AutoSetReceived.gif" alt="image\AutoSetReceived.gif" title="image\AutoSetReceived.gif" width="88" height="28" border="0"/></p>
<p>Clicking the Auto Set Quantity Received button sets the Received quantity 
 for all items still on order. The Received quantity field may then be 
 adjusted by the user if needed. <span>The use of this button is denied 
 if one or more items are flagged as Serialized since the validation to 
 require a serial number is not supported. If any serialized lines are 
 detected, the error message will indicate which lines refer to serialized 
 items. </span></p>
<p><span><img src="assets/images/PrintPackingSlip.bmp" alt="" style="border: none;" border="0"/> 
  This button calls Report Purchasing Packing Slip (RPOPCKNGSLP.rpt). 
 Note that this report must be installed and assigned to the appropriate 
 user groups. The input fields Beginning / Ending Date and Inventory Receipt 
 Id will be automatically completed by the system.  </span></p>
<p><font style="font-weight: bold;">Entered By: Date Entered: Time Entered:</font><br/>
These display only fields are maintained by the system when this transaction 
 is saved.</p>
<p><font style="font-weight: bold;">Ordered By: Vendor Id: Ship To Id: 
 Location Id:</font> <font style="font-weight: bold;"><br/>
Extended Description: Job Id: WorkOrder Id:<br/>
</font>These display-only fields default from the PO.</p>
<p> </p>
<p class="Tab">Summary Tab</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: bold;">PO Id:  Vendor Id:  Tax Group 
 Id:</span><br/>
 These display-only fields default from the Purchase Order&#39;s Main tab. 
 Note that the Tax Group Id will only be completed if it is completed in 
 the Purchase Order&#39;s Main tab.</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: bold;">Subtotal:</span><br/>
This field displays the expected Vendor Invoice cost total based on this 
 Inventory Receipt.</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: bold;">Tax:</span> <br/>
 This field displays the tax anticipated to be assessed on vendor&#39;s invoice 
 from this Inventory Receipt. This field will ONLY be completed if a Sales 
 Tax Group with &quot;job costed&quot; authorities exists on the Purchase 
 Order Main Tab.  If a Tax Group is not specified on the PO Main Tab, 
 or if one is specified but it is NOT &quot;job costed&quot;, this field 
 will NOT display the calculated tax.</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: bold;">Total:</span><br/>
Displays the Subtotal + anticipate Tax (if calculated),</p>
<p> </p>
<p class="Tab">Receipts Tab</p>
<p><font style="font-weight: bold;">Ord&#39;d<br/>
</font> This display-only field lists the quantity of this item on the 
 purchase or change order. The message &quot;warning: quantity received 
 exceeds quantity on order&quot; appears if you generate an additional 
 entry for a PO that was already received.  Exiting the entry 
 at this point will prevent over-receiving.</p>
<p><font style="font-weight: bold;">OnOrder:<br/>
</font> The quantity of this item yet to be received for this PO. This 
 display-only field is maintained by the system and does not reflect the 
 quantity received in this current transaction.</p>
<p><font style="font-weight: bold;">Rcv&#39;d:<br/>
</font> If this is a new transaction, simply record the quantity of this 
 item you are receiving at this time. In the case of serialized inventory, 
 one line (with a Ord&#39;d quantity of 1) will be created for each item not 
 yet received. Each serialized item received would be assigned a Rcv&#39;d: 
 quantity of 1, and its Serial Number recorded.</p>
<p>If you are correcting a previous transaction where the quantity received 
 was entered incorrectly, enter the quantity that was actually received 
 (as it should have been entered in the first place).</p>
<p> <font style="font-weight: bold;">Note: Un-receiving and Re-receiving 
 Items received to Jobs / Work Orders</font></p>
<p style="margin-left: 36.00pt;">If it is necessary to ‘un-receive’ an 
 item in order to change the underlying purchase order (e.g., such as the 
 cost or cost category), always re-receive the item to a NEW Inventory 
 Receipts Journal entry. Reusing an existing entry can lead to problems 
 in JCH.</p>
<p><font style="font-weight: bold;">Con<br/>
</font> Optional. The number of containers in which these items were received.</p>
<p><font style="font-weight: bold;">Import Entry #<br/>
</font> If this item was imported, record its entry number. For Lot Controlled 
 items, the Import Entry Number field is copied into the new Lot Master 
 record when it is created.</p>
<p><font style="font-weight: bold;">Receiving Serial/Lot#:</font><br/>
The Serial Number or Lot Number as it appears on the item or lot.</p>
<p><font style="font-weight: bold;">U-M: Inventory Item Id: Description: 
 Vendor&#39;s Part #:<br/>
</font> These display-only fields default from the PO.</p>
<p><font style="font-weight: bold;">Complete</font><br/>
Checking this field enables you to under-receive and close a PO for buying 
 stock to inventory that is essentially complete (e.g., 990 out of 1000 
 items received).</p>
<p>The Completed flag may <font style="text-decoration: underline; ">not</font> 
 be set for PO lines associated with Jobs or Work Orders.</p>
<p><font style="font-weight: bold;">Receiving Description</font><br/>
Optional: briefly describes this item.</p>
<p><font style="font-weight: bold;">NAFTA Certified?</font><br/>
Reserved for future use.</p>
<p><font style="font-weight: bold;">New Lot?</font><br/>
Display-only. If this item is Lot Controlled and you enter a Serial Lot 
 number, the system will check for a corresponding Vendor Lot number. If 
 a matching Vendor lot number is not found, the system will later use this 
 information to create a new Lot Master record and allocate the inventory 
 as needed.</p>
<p><img src="assets/images/image/Magnify.gif" alt="" style="border: none;" border="0"/> 
 Click the Magnify button to display the Full View of the selected line.</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: bold;">Job Qty Received:</span><br/>
