<h1>Employee Viewer Paid Time Off Tab</h1>
<h2>Purpose:</h2>
<p>Record the hours of paid time off (e.g., sick pay, vacation pay, etc.) 
 the employee earns each pay period or has earned for a specific time frame.</p>
<h2>Usage:</h2>
<p>This information on this tab is interfaced to Payroll Periods, Pay Types, 
 Compute Payroll and Print Payroll Checks. Note that the PTO accrual will 
 only take place when Compute Payroll is run if the Start and End dates 
 of the Payroll Period intersect with the Start and End Dates of the PTO 
 tab.</p>
<p>In versions prior to 9.1, setup is cumulative, not &quot;Use it or Lose 
 it&quot;. Since PTO is cumulative, an ending balance may need to be cleared 
 at the end of a payroll year for sick or holiday pay types. In addition, 
 if user set-up is bad, or ending balances are wrong, the user can use 
 the PR Journal to enter an adjustment (using a unique pay period for PTO 
 adjustments) to Hours Accrued to reverse the accruals and start over on 
 the next PR Compute of check date. Or, the user can enter minus hours 
 on the PTO tab to post reversals when the next Compute PR is run.</p>
<p>In Version 9.1, the software also supports 
 PTO based on a Annual Maximum Balance (or Cap) for companies with a “Use 
 it or Lose it” PTO policy. The Max Hours field specifies the Cap or maximum 
 total PTO hours &#39;in the bank&#39; that  this employee is allowed to accrue 
 for the specified Pay Type Id/Rate range.  When Compute Payroll is 
 run, the accrued hours may be limited so that the Max Hours Cap is not 
 exceeded.</p>
<p style="margin-left: 48px;"><span style="font-weight: bold;">Setup:</span> 
 <br/>
 Typically, the  PTO tab would need 
 to be setup based on the employees date hired (anniversary date) and Years 
 of Service (i.e. 1-4yrs, 5-9yrs, 10-14yrs, 15+).  The Max Hours should 
 be set up to specify the Max Hours for each line.</p>
<p><font style="font-weight: bold;">PTO Reporting</font> - These reports 
 include all *<font style="font-weight: bold;">unposted</font> checks in 
 the Ending Balance, whereas printed checks will only include the most 
 <font style="text-decoration: underline; ">current</font> unposted check 
 in the `PTO Avail Balance’. Adjustments may be required to clear begin/ending 
 balances so checks print with the proper PTO balance.</p>
<p class="Support_Heading_2">Internal Support: <a href="PTO_Hours_Available_Checks_vs_Reports.htm"><font color="#000000">PTO Hours Available: Checks vs. Reports</font></a></p>
<h2>Examples:</h2>
<p style="margin-left: 48px;">Setting up a date range of a year vs. start/stop 
 = same date result in the following (if Pay Period set to Accrue PTO):<br/>
<font style="font-weight: bold;">Setup Start  End   Type 
  Hours  Result<br/>
</font><br/>
bad  01-01-2005 12-31-2005  VAC  40  52 pays x 
 40 = 2080 hrs accrued<br/>
good  01-01-2005  01-01-2005  VAC  40  1 pay x 
 40 = 40 hrs accrued</p>
<p style="margin-left: 48px;">bad 01-01-2005 01-01-2005 VAC 2 1 
 pay x 2 = 2 hrs accrued<br/>
good 01-01-2005 12-31-2005 VAC 2 52 pays x 2 = 
 104 hrs accrued</p>
<h2>Important Fields (PTO Tab):</h2>
<p><font style="font-weight: bold;">Hours:</font><br/>
The number of paid time off hours (e.g., sick, vacation, etc.) that you 
 earn per pay period (e.g., 1.5 hours per weekly pay period, 3.1 hours 
 every biweekly pay, etc.). If you track paid time off under different 
 pay type categories (e.g., vacation, sick, bereavement), you would create 
 one line for each. See the above examples if PTO is set on a yearly basis.</p>
<p><font style="font-weight: bold;">Prcnt:<br/>
</font>The percent of wages field (Prcnt:) allows this Paid Time Off to 
 be calculated as a Percent of Wages rather than a number of Hours. Any 
 one PTO line can have either Hours or Percent but not both.</p>
<p style="margin-left: 36.00pt;"><font style="font-weight: bold;">Important 
 Note:<br/>
</font> SAMPRO does NOT have support for multiple percentages per employee 
 in a single pay period. All percentage rate changes must coincide with 
 the starting date of a Pay Period.</p>
<p><font style="font-weight: bold;">Pay Type Id:</font><br/>
Enter a valid Id of a Pay Type for paid time off, or double-click to select 
 from a list. Note that the Description field defaults from the Pay Type 
 Name when a Pay Type Id is entered.</p>
<p><font style="font-weight: bold;">Start Date: Date End:</font><br/>
These fields define the range of dates for which hours will be accrued 
 for this pay type when Compute Payroll is run. This accrual will only 
 take place if the Start and End dates of the payroll period intersect 
 with the Start and End Dates of the PTO tab of the Employee record and 
 Accrual PTO is turned on in the Payroll Period. The system uses the last 
 day of the pay period to post the accruals, so a check date of January 
 may accrue December hours !! For example: if Pay period starts 12/25 thru 
 12/31 with a check date of 01/05 and employee start/end PTO date of 12/27, 
 the system will post the accrual using the 12/31 date.</p>
<p style="margin-left: 36.00pt;"><font style="font-weight: bold;">Note: 
 Time Off Earned from Working the Previous Year</font><br/>
If paid time off is earned as function of the previous year&#39;s employment, 
 the Hours and Start and End Date fields would be completed in a different 
 fashion. In this case, the Hours field would be used to enter the total 
 Hours earned as result of working last year. The Start Date and Date End 
 would be set to the employee&#39;s anniversary date (or a general company 
 date on which PTO is accrued) in the year the accrual should take place. 
 For example, suppose an employee&#39;s employment anniversary date is March 
 1, and in the year from March 1, 2016 to Feb 28, 2017, he is due 80 hours 
 of paid vacation. We&#39;ll also assume that the first payroll period within 
 the anniversary year is March 1-March 7, with check date March 10. In 
 this case, the fields would be completed as follows:</p>
<p style="margin-left: 88px;"> Hours  Pay Type  Start Date 
  Date End<br/>
 80.00 Vacation  03012016  03012016</p>
<p style="margin-left: 36.00pt;">In this example, the accrual will occur 
 only once in 2016, when payroll is computed for the payroll period March 
 1-7. Notice that an additional line would have to be added for the vacation 
 accrual to occur in 2017.</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: bold;">Max 
 Hours:</span><br/>
 This field supports PTO based on a Annual Maximum Balance (or Cap) for 
 companies with a “Use it or Lose it” PTO policy. This field specifies 
 the Cap or maximum total PTO hours &#39;in the bank&#39; that  this employee 
 is allowed to accrue for the specified Pay Type Id/Sate range.  When 
 Compute Payroll is run, the accrued hours may be limited so that the Max 
 Hours Cap is not exceeded.</p>
<p style="margin-left: 48px;"><span style="font-weight: bold;">Setup:</span><br/>
Typically, the  PTO tab would need to be setup based on the employees 
 date hired (anniversary date) and Years of Service (i.e. 1-4yrs, 5-9yrs, 
 10-14yrs, 15+).</p>
