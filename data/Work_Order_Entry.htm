<h1>Work Order Entry Viewer</h1>
<h2>Purpose:</h2>
<p>This function streamlines the entry of time, inventory materials, and other charges to the Work Order Labor, Other and Inventory tabs. Once these entries have been added, edits would be made directly to the work order. This function may be run stand-alone or launched from the Dispatch Board.</p>
<h2>Usage:</h2>
<p>Weekly Payroll periods must be set up and maintained. These periods control the automatic recalculation of hours over 40 to the overtime category. The appropriate payroll period should be flagged as the default period every week. Appropriate accounting periods should also be created and maintained to optimize this function.</p>
<p>The user may record inventory / other items if the payroll period crosses a month boundary, and the Accounting Period (referenced in the Pay Period) does not. The Accounting Period for Inventory/Other entries will now be based on the line&#39;s Work Date and the Pay Period&#39;s &#39;Prior Period Accruals&#39; Period End Date.  If the Work Date is less than or equal to the prior period end date, then the &#39;Prior Period Accruals&#39; Accounting Period is used.  If not, then the normal Accounting Period is used.</p>
<p>Default Pay Type and Labor Rates for regular, overtime and double hours must be entered and maintained in the Technician record.</p>
<p>In order to enter hours, a technician must be attached to the Technician tab of the work order.</p>
<p>This function may not be used to enter time to Work Orders that are marked &#39;Invoice Ready&#39;. Also, if a work order is closed (e.g., the Date Closed field is completed), the system will prevent you from adding time or materials to it via the Work Order Entry function.</p>
<h2>Registry Entries:</h2>
<p>A registry entry for <a href="Registry_Entry_Workorder_Entry_Defaults.htm">Workorder Entry Defaults</a> must be made to provide default values for the Cost Categories to be used with Standard, Overtime and Doubletime Labor, and Inventory Items.</p>
<p>An option of the sys-ffv-global-settings registry entry (<a href="Registry_Entry_Global_Settings__Column_Compression__Dispatch_Board_Rows__History_Log_Inventory_Markup.htm">Registry Entry Global Settings</a> ) enables the system to determine whether hours should be considered &#39;office&#39; or &#39;field&#39; depending on the Job Cost Code&#39;s Work Type setting. If this option is implemented, hours charged to a &#39;Field&#39; Job Cost Code will be considered field hours, regardless of whether the employee is Office or Field.</p>
<h2>Important Fields: Upper Section</h2>
<p>The upper section of this viewer displays information pertaining to the line selected in the lower section of the screen.</p>
<p><font style="font-weight: bold;">Tech:  Regular:  Overtime: Doubletime: Total:<br/>
Date: <br/>
Period Id:<br/></font>The historical Regular, Overtime, and Doubletime hours are displayed for the specified Tech. Cumulative hours are shown by Date and Pay Period. This information is updated as you add time to the selected line.</p>
<h2>Important Fields: Lower Section</h2>
<p><font style="font-weight: bold;">Workorder Id:<br/></font>Enter the Workorder to which you wish to apply time, inventory or other charges. You may <font style="font-weight: bold;">not</font> select a Workorder that is flagged as Invoice Ready.</p>
<p>Changing the WO Id will not change the Tech; this must be done manually.</p>
<p><font style="font-weight: bold;">Equipment Id:<br/></font>By default, the system loads the Equipment Id from the first line of the Work Order equipment tab. Double-clicking on the Equipment Id field will bring up a list of the equipment for the Client Site for which the Work Order was created. If you select a piece of Equipment not yet included on the Work Order, the system will automatically add it to the Work Order for you when you click the Add button to create the entry.</p>
<p><font style="font-weight: bold;">Effective Date:</font><br/>
The Effective Date for this entry. Press Spacebar to select today&#39;s day, or enter the date in mmddyyyy format (the year will default to the current year when you begin to type in the date). The Effective Date must fall within the date range defined by the Pay Period.</p>
<p><font style="font-weight: bold;">Pay Period Id:<br/></font>The system will enter the default payroll period for you. You may change to a different pay period by entering the id or double-clicking to select from a list of active payroll periods.</p>
<p><font style="font-weight: bold;">Tech Id:<br/></font>Enter the Technician&#39;s Id or double-click to select from a list. You may only enter time for Technicians that are already listed on this Work Order&#39;s Tech tab.</p>
<p><font style="font-weight: bold;">Reg Work: <br/></font>Enter the hours of Regular Time worked for costing and payroll purposes. If this would push the historical Regular Hours over 40 for this Pay Period, the Regular and Overtime Hours will be recalculated.</p>
<p><font style="font-weight: bold;">Reg Billed:<br/></font>This field defaults from Reg Work, but may be adjusted by the user. It will be used by the system to compute billable revenue.</p>
<p><font style="font-weight: bold;">O/T Work: <br/></font>The Overtime hours this technician worked.</p>
<p><font style="font-weight: bold;">O/T Billed:<br/></font>This field defaults from O/T Work, but may be adjusted by the user. It will be used by the system to compute the Overtime hours the customer should be billed for.</p>
<p><font style="font-weight: bold;">D/T Work: <br/></font>The Doubletime hours this technician worked.</p>
<p><font style="font-weight: bold;">D/T Billed:<br/></font>This field defaults from D/T Work, but may be adjusted by the user. It will be used by the system to compute the Doubletime hours the customer should be billed for.</p>
<p><font style="font-weight: bold;">Qty Used:<br/></font>The quantity of the Inventory Item <font style="text-decoration: underline;">or</font> Other Charge to be applied to this work order.</p>
<p><font style="font-weight: bold;">Lctn:<br/></font>This field is required if you are billing for an Inventory Item. Enter the location it was picked from or double-click to select from a list.</p>
<p><font style="font-weight: bold;">Inventory Item Id: Inventory Item Name:<br/></font>To add inventory charges to this work order, enter an Inventory Id or double-click to select from a list. By default, both the Quantity Used (for costing) and the Quantity Billed default from the Qty field, but may be adjusted by the user on the Full View of this line (accessed by clicking the Magnifier icon).</p>
<p><font style="font-weight: bold;">Note:</font> You may specify either an Inventory Item Id or an Other Rate Id per line. Simply add additional lines to bill multiple Inventory Item Id&#39;s or Other Rates.</p>
<p><font style="font-weight: bold;">Other Rate Id: Description:<br/></font>To add other charges to this work order, enter an Other Rate Id or double-click to select from a list. The Description defaults from the Other Rate record, but may be adjusted by the user if needed.</p>
<p><font style="font-weight: bold;">Work Performed:<br/></font>Enter the Work Performed on this Equipment. This information will be added to the Work Performed text box on the Work Order Equipment tab.</p>
<p><font style="font-weight: bold;">GL Entity:<br/></font>The GL Entity will now always default as follows: First from the Job Cost Code, next from the Location, last from the Inventory Group.</p>
