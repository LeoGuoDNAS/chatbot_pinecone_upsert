<p><font style="font-weight: bold;">Labor Rate Id:</font><br/>
This field will default in when the Employee Id is selected on the Main 
 tab.</p>
<p>It is used to provide the default Labor Rate category for this technician 
 to use when entering hours in TechAnywhere,  the Work Order Labor 
 tab and WO Time Entry (regular time) for Field hours (as determined by 
 the Employee record or Job Cost Code). The Labor Rate will default from 
 the Employee record (Labor Rate Id field) for Office type hours entered 
 on the Work Order Labor tab and the Work Order Entry function.</p>
<p style="margin-left: 36.00pt;"><font style="font-weight: bold;">Note: 
 Prevailing Wages Jobs – Employee Overrides</font><br/>
If you are entering time for a Prevailing Wages Job, the values found in 
 the Employee Overrides tab of the Job record will override the default 
 employee Labor Rate and Pay Type. These overrides will only be implemented 
 when the cost code type is set to field for the journal entry.</p>
<p style="margin-left: 36.00pt;"><font style="font-weight: bold;">Registry 
 Setting: Office/Field Determined by Job Cost Code<br/>
</font>An option of the sys-ffv-global-settings registry entry (<a href="Registry_Entry_Global_Settings__Column_Compression__Dispatch_Board_Rows__History_Log_Inventory_Markup.htm">Registry 
 Entry Global Settings</a> ) enables the system to determine whether hours 
 should be considered &#39;office&#39; or &#39;field&#39; depending on the Job Cost Code&#39;s 
 Work Type setting. If this option is implemented, hours charged to a &#39;Field&#39; 
 Job Cost Code will be considered field hours, regardless of whether the 
 employee is Office or Field.</p>
<p><font style="font-weight: bold;">Pay Type Id:</font><font style="font-weight: bold;"><br/>
</font>The default Pay Type for this technician to use when entering hours 
 in the Work Order Labor tab for Job Cost Codes flagged as Field. If the 
 Cost Code is flagged as Office, the Pay Type will default from the Employee 
 record for hours entered on the Work Order Labor tab. The Work Order Entry 
 function always uses the Employee pay type default.</p>
<p><font style="font-weight: bold;">Employee Type Id:</font><br/>
Enter a valid employee type or double-click to select from a list. This 
 field can be used to differentiate between employees and sub-contracting

 stocking location. Press Alt+F7 or double click on this field to select 
 from a list.</p>
<p><font style="font-weight: bold;">No Escalation?</font><font style="font-weight: bold;"><br/>
</font>Flagging this field stops future &quot;Tech Based&quot; escalation 
 events from being generated when this Technician is added to a work order. 
 Typically, this field would be flagged for a &quot;non-tech&quot; (such 
 as a billing agent).</p>
<p>If this field is not flagged, &quot;Tech Based&quot; events (any event 
 where to Notify Id points to the Technician radio button) from the Escalation 
 Profile will continue to be duplicated when a new or additional tech is 
 assigned to a work order.</p>

</font>If this Technician record is for a subcontractor and you want a 
 purchase order to be automatically generated when a work order is generated, 
 select this option AND set complete the Vendor Id field on the Main tab. 
 This option should also be selected if the this technician will be accessing 
 the software via SubAnywhere. If a PO is linked to a work order for this 
 Subcontractor, the Purchase Order Shipping address can be set to the Technician 
 Address (on the Main tab of the Technician record) by clicking the Service 
 Provider option.</p>
<p style="margin-left: 36.00pt;"><font style="font-weight: bold;">Technician<br/>
</font>Select Technician if this technician will be accessing the software 
 via TechAnywhere. The default status for these techs is Unacknowledged 
 unless overridden by registry.</p>
<p style="margin-left: 36.00pt;"><font style="font-weight: bold;">Client<br/>
</font>In previous releases<font style="font-weight: bold;">,</font> Client 
 was used to identify a customer accessing the software via the Client 
 Web interface. Although this usage is still supported, its use is deprecated 
 in favor of using a <a href="Web_Users_Viewer.htm">Web User Record</a> 
 to enable client access. Note that technicians identified with Client 
 web access will not be displayed when you double-click to select a technician 
 in the New Call, Dispatch Board, or Work Order viewers.</p>
<p style="margin-left: 36.00pt;"><font style="font-weight: bold;">CSR<br/>
</font>Select CSR if this individual will be accessing the software via 
 the CSRAnywhere interface. <span style="font-weight: bold;">This option 
 is obsolete in Version 9.0 and above.</span></p>
<p style="font-weight: bold;">Remote Device Type</p>
<p style="font-weight: bold; margin-left: 48px;">None: <span style="font-weight: normal;">Select

 the type of device he or she is using (Windows or Android).</span></p>
<p style="margin-left: 48px;"><span style="font-weight: bold;">CE - Web:</span> 
 Custom implementations only. Note that the Remote Pin field must be completed 
 for IVR installations.</p>

<p style="margin-left: 48px;"><span style="font-weight: bold;">SubAnywhere 
 (Version 9.1):</span> If SubAnywhere IS enabled and Web Access is set 
 to Subcontractor, set the Remote Device Type to SubAnywhere. This field 
 controls whether PO’s are created as Released (None) or Unreleased (SubAnywhere). 
 An additional test is used to determine if Subcontractor PO&#39;s are set 
 to released based on the presence or absence of the New Password field 
 below. If the tech is flagged as Web Access - Subcontractor and Remote 
 Device - none. If the New Password is set, the PO will be set to 
 Unreleased. If the New Password is blank, the PO will be set to Released. 
 SubAnywhere PO&#39;s generated in New Call, by selecting a Subcontractor in 
 TechFinders, and from the Work Order will be set to Unreleased if the 
 Password is completed.</p>
<p style="font-weight: bold; margin-left: 48px;">DBFleet: The DBFleet option 
 supports a new mode built into the TechAnywhere app that only allows the 
 user to use the DBFleet portion for GPS tracking and reporting to DBFleet. 
 It disables all other TechAnywhere functionality. This allows a company 
 that does not use TechAnywhere or has employees who would not need to 
 use TechAnywhere, to have the ability to track these employees through 
 DBFleet. </p>
<p style="margin-left: 88px;"><span style="font-weight: bold;">Important 
 Implementation Note:</span> If a client does not have/use TechAnywhere 
 and wants to do this for DBFleet, a full TechAnywhere install will need 
 to take place first. Licensing for this mode is handled in DBFleet - SAMPro 
 does not track count. In order to log into TechAnywhere in this mode, 
 the Technician record will need to be configured as follows:</p>
<p style="margin-left: 88px;">Web Access = Technician<br/>
Remote Device Type = DBFleet<br/>
Set and confirm a password</p>
<p><font style="font-weight: bold;">New Password: Confirm Password:<br/>
</font>This field is required if this is a TechAnywhere Technician or Web-Enabled 
 Client (if using the old-style web access). The password must be entered 
 and re-entered (in the Confirm Password box) to be valid. <font style="font-weight: bold;">The 
 password is restricted to letters and numbers only. </font></p>
<p><font style="font-weight: bold;">Web Security Id:<br/>
</font>This field is typically completed for a Client record, to limit 
 the equipment he or she has access to on the Client Web Interface. If 
 web access is enabled for this Technician, enter the appropriate Web Security 
 if you want to control which work orders this technician will have access 
 to.</p>
<p><font style="font-weight: bold;">TechAnywhere Prefix<br/>
</font>This field is required to facilitate a unique numbering scheme for 
 Purchase Orders created in TechAnywhere.  PO numbers will be generated 
 using a 5-digit counter, prefixed by the Tech Prefix ... i.e. JT10001.</p>
<p><font style="font-weight: bold;">Remote Pin:<br/>
</font>If Voice Response (IVR) is implemented on your system, enter the 
 4-digit access code for this user.</p>
<p><font style="font-weight: bold;">Last TA Activity Date: Last TA Activity 
 Time: Last TA Version:<br/>
</font>This display-only field shows the most recent TechAnywhere activity 
 and version number used by the selected Technician. This field is updated

<p>This tab displays the Technician’s current Evaluation Grade earned on 
 work orders for which he/she was the primary technician. It may also be 
 used to launch the Compute Technician Evaluation function.</p>
<p><font style="font-weight: bold;">Evaluation Grade:</font><br/>
The Evaluation field is computed by the system (when <a href="Start_Compute_Technician_Evaluation.htm">Start 
 Compute Technician Evaluation</a> is run) based on the number of points 
 that were earned divided by the number of points available during the 
 specified time period. The higher the score (out of 100), the better the 
 evaluation. This field may be manually set if the computed evaluation 
 does not actually reflect the technician’s performance, or if your firm 
 employs a different method to establish technician grades.</p>
