<H1>Closing a Purchase Order </H1>
 <H2>Purpose: </H2>
 <P>A PO should be closed after it (and any required change orders) has been printed and all items on the order have been marked as received on the PO or in the Inventory Item Receipt Journal.  </P>
 <P>You can then close the PO by flagging the &quot;Close PO?&quot; box in the AP Journal. </P>
 <P>In Version 7.1 and up, PO’s with a status of Released may now be marked as Closed in the Purchase Order viewer. This change conforms to the A/P functionality where a PO could be set to &quot;Closed&quot; when the PO status was “Released.”  </P>
 <H3>Setting the Date Closed Manually</H3>
 <P>If your firm does not typically print purchase orders, the Date Closed may be set manually. Doing so will not change the Purchase Order’s status, but will prevent it from displaying in the active Purchase Order list. </P>
 <P><FONT style="font-weight:bold; " >PO Status&nbsp;Setting the Date Closed</FONT></P>
 <P>Released&nbsp;You may enter the Date Closed. If the PO Period on the Main tab is inactive, the system will inform </P>
 <P style="margin-left:72.00pt;">that the period is inactive: click OK to confirm the message. The system will allow you to save the record with the Date Closed set.</P>
 <P>Printed&nbsp;&nbsp;When you enter the Date Closed and attempt to save the work order, the system will ask if wish to</P>
 <P style="margin-left:72.00pt;">make this a Change Order.  Click No and save the PO; the Date Closed will be set. </P>
 <P style="margin-left:72.00pt;">If the PO Period on the Main tab is inactive, the system will also inform that the period is inactive: click OK to confirm the message. The system will allow you to save the record with the Date Closed set.</P>
 <P>Changed&nbsp;If the PO has a Status of Changed, and the accounting period on the Main tab is active, you will be </P>
 <P style="margin-left:72.00pt;">able to set the Date Closed and Save the PO. </P>
 <P style="margin-left:72.00pt;">However, if the Status is Changed AND the Accounting Period is Inactive, you must do the following before setting the Date Closed:</P>
 <P style="margin-left:72.00pt;">1) Print the Purchase Order (this will set the status to Printed).</P>
 <P style="margin-left:72.00pt;">2) Click the Refresh button.</P>
 <P style="margin-left:72.00pt;">3) Enter the Date Closed and save the PO. You will be alerted about the inactive accounting period, but the system will complete the save with the Date Closed.</P>
 <P>Pending Cancel&nbsp;If the status is Pending Cancel, you will not be able to set the Date Closed on the PO. </P>
 <P style="margin-left:72.00pt;">Print the Purchase Order; doing so will set the Status to Canceled.</P>
 <P>Cancelled&nbsp;Cancelled PO’s will not appear on the list of list of Active PO’s, so the Date Closed need not be set. </P>
 <P style="margin-left:72.00pt;">However, should you wish to do so you may. </P>
 <P>Closed&nbsp;&nbsp;The Date Closed field is now automatically set when the status of the PO is set to Closed. </P>
