  <h1>Quote Viewer - Obsolete</h1>
  <p><span style="font-weight: bold;">NOTE:</span> The <a href="Quote_Manager_Viewer.htm">Quote Manager Viewer</a> should be used in Versions 9.1 and Above.</p>
  <h2>Purpose:</h2>
  <p class="Block_Text">This viewer enables sales quotes to be created and maintained. It may be also be used to update quotes generated from CRMAnywhere or TechAnywhere (see <a href="Quotes_Generated_by_TechAnywhere.htm">Quotes Generated by TechAnywhere</a> ).</p>
  <p class="Block_Text">A quote may contain multiple options. Each of the lower tabs has an ‘Option Code’ field. All detail lines having the same Option Code are tied together in that they pertain to the same Quote Option.</p>
  <p>When a quote is initially created, all options default to Open. When the customer approvals one or more options on a quote, the <a href="Quotemaster_Approval_Wizard.htm">QuoteMaster Approval Wizard</a> can be invoked which will enable the user to automatically generate the appropriate work orders and purchase orders needed to complete the work.</p>
  <h2>Usage:</h2>
  <p style="font-weight: bold;">Cloning a Quote: <span style="font-weight: normal;"><a class="dropspot" data-rhwidget="DropSpot" data-target="POPUP613332219" href="#"><span data-open-text="true" data-skip-index="true">Click for Details</span><span data-close-text="true">Click for Details</span></a></span></p>
  <div data-targetname="POPUP613332219">
    <p>To ‘clone’ an existing quote, enter the word <font style="font-weight: bold;">new</font>
      in the quote id of an existing quote and tab out of the field: a new
      quote is generated with the following changes implemented:</p>
    <p style="margin-left: 48px;">On the
      Main tab, the WO Id and Job Id are cleared. <br/>
      On the Scope tab, set all options to Open, clears the WO Id and Job
      Billing Id (if they exist) and the
      Equipment Id, as well as the Opened, Accepted, Approved
      and Declined Fields.<br/>
      On the Inventory Tab, clear the PO Id and Vendor Quote No.<br/>
      On the Material Tab, clear the PO Id and Vendor Quote No.<br/>
      On the Subcontractor Tab, clear the PO Id and Vendor Quote No.<br/>
      On the Notes tab (header info) set the Status to Open, Status Category
      to Active, and Status date to today.</p>
    <p>The new quote may now be edited.  To change the Site, do the
      following:</p>
    <p style="margin-left: 48px;">1. Blank the WorkOrder Id and Job fields
      (if completed)<br/>
      2. Blank the Equipment Id in all Scope Lines.<br/>
      3. Enter the Site Id the new Quote is for.<br/>
      4. Enter the appropriate Equipment Id for that Site on all Scope lines.</p>
    <p>The system will assign the appropriate Quote Id when the record
      is saved.</p>
  </div>
  <p><span style="font-weight: bold;">Approval Wizard Failures:</span> If a WO o PO fails to be generated, the software displays a message box and writes the errors as .txt files to the directory defined by the dbreportfiles registry id.</p>
  <p>
    <font style="font-weight: bold;">Scope Option Must Be Open to Allow Changes</font>
    <font style="font-weight: bold;">(unless registry enabled)</font><br/>
    The system disallows changes to any scope lines and any associated lines if the status is set to Printed, Accepted, Approved or Declined (the user must change status to Open to make changes).  A registry option may be enabled to allow changes to Accepted options (see <a href="Registry_Entry_Quotemaster.htm">Registry Quotemaster (sys-viewer-vqte)</a> .
  </p>
  <p>
    <font style="font-weight: bold;">Accounting Periods</font>
    <font style="font-weight: bold;">:</font> A Default Accounting Period should be defined and maintained if Purchase Orders are to be created or updated from Quote Master. When generating the PO, the system
  </p>
  <p style="margin-left: 36.00pt;">1. Uses the default Accounting Period (if it exists),<br/>
    2. If no default exists, it uses the &#39;first&#39; active period with today&#39;s date in the date range. <br/>
    3. If both of the above fail, the Wizard warns the user, and the PO post fails.</p>
  <p>
    <font style="font-weight: bold;">Initial Setup Considerations</font><br/>
    The Quote Recap and Quote Form reports must be imported into your database in order to use the full capability of QuoteMaster. Contact your support representative for details. A User-defined function, RQTERCP, must be created which references the recap report RQTERCP1. This report will be invoked when the View Recap button is printed.
  </p>
  <p>
    <font style="font-weight: bold;">Material Requisitioning</font><br/>
    If the registry option UseQuoteRequiredResources is set to true in sys-ffv-global-settings, the system will use the following rules when generating Work Orders/PO’s from Quotes:
  </p>
  <p style="margin-left: 36.00pt;">If a Vendor is not specified in an Inventory or Subcontractor line, the regular Quotemaster processing will occur AND lines will be written to the Required Resource Tab.</p>
  <p style="margin-left: 36.00pt;">If a Vendor is specified on the Inventory or Sub tabs, the applicable purchase orders will be created and these lines will NOT be written to the Required Resource tab.</p>

	 border-right: 1.50pt solid #000000;"><a name="Quote_Main_Tab" id="Quote_Main_Tab"></a>Main Tab</p>
  <p>
    <font style="font-weight: bold;">Quote Id:</font><br/>
    A unique Id for this Quote. This field is automatically generated by the system when you click the Add Record button to create a new Quote.
  </p>
  <p>
    <font style="font-weight: bold;">Description:</font><br/>
    This optional field may be used to briefly describe the Quote, or display other pertinent information. If this Quote was submitted from Techanywhere, this field lists how the problem was found <span id="BugEvents171">(Unit Down, PM Visit or Service Call) and the Tech Id of the Tech submitting the Quote.</span>
  </p>
  <p><span style="font-weight: bold;">Submitted By:</span><br/>
    This optional field may be used to record the submitter&#39;s name or initials.</p>
  <p>
    <font style="font-weight: bold;">Estimator Id:<br/>
      <span style="font-weight: normal;">This field specifies the</span>
    </font> Estimator responsible for this Quote (optional); it <font><span style="font-weight: normal;">defaults from the Quote&#39;s Job record</span></font> anytime the Job is changed (by direct edits to the Job Id or by changing the Work Order Id).
  </p>
  <p>
    <font style="font-weight: bold;">Expiration Date:</font><br/>
    This field indicates the last day on which the customer can accept the quote. This field is available for reporting purposes, but NO warnings or validations are performed relative to approving options.
  </p>
  <p>
    <font style="font-weight: bold;">WorkOrder Id:</font><br/>
    If this quote is being generated in response to a Work Order, enter the Work Order Id. When you do so, the Site Id, Tax Group and Status, Sales Rep, and Rate Schedule (from the associated Job record) will default in. A Work Order may be used as the source Work Order on multiple Quotes.
  </p>
  <p>You are not allowed to select an Archived Work Order as the source Work Order. The system prevents WO’s flagged as Credit Hold from being used as a source work order. A user with Credit Manager permissions must edit a Work Order to remove it from the Credit Hold status.</p>
  <p>Closed Work Orders may only be specified if a registry setting is in effect. The Quote Approval wizard requires the use of the New WO option when the Quote&#39;s main WO is a closed WO; it will not allow the user to select a closed WO.</p>
  <p>
    <font style="font-weight: bold;">Job Id:</font><br/>
    This field defaults from the Work Order or may be selected by the user to provide the default Job when the Quotemaster Wizard is run. This Job’s Material Price Level will be used for default pricing on the Quote’s Inventory tab, overriding the Client Site Material Price. If the Job Id is not completed, the system will continue to use the Site’s Material Price Level.
  </p>
  <p>If the Job Id is selected manually, the system defaults in the Report Id, Quote Notes and Small Print from Job&#39;s Site, and the Branch Id will be set from the Job (if completed in the Job record) or from the Job’s Site (if the Branch is blank in the Job but completed in the Site).</p>
  <p style="margin-left: 48px;">
    <font style="font-weight: bold;">Unknown Tax Status:</font>  Jobs with Tax Status of ‘Unknown’ are excluded from selection as lead work orders, and in the Quote Master Wizard.
  </p>
  <p>
    <font style="font-weight: bold;">Site Id:</font><br/>
    The Site for which the Quote is being generated. If this field has not already defaulted in (by completing the above field), enter a valid Client Site Id, or double-click to select from a list. The Site CANNOT be changed if any Scope or Equipment Tab lines have the Equipment Id completed. This includes the user changing the Site directly, or changing the source Work Order or Job to one referencing a different site.
  </p>
  <p>
    <font style="font-weight: bold;">Date Opened:</font><br/>
    This field defaults to today’s date, but may be changed by the user if needed.
  </p>
  <p style="margin-left: 36.00pt;">
    <font style="font-weight: bold;">Important Note: Pricing</font><br/>
    One of the following fields should be completed if you want QuoteMaster to mark up costs to determine the price of the quote. Once the quote has been built, you may then turn it into a fixed fee quote by completing the Fixed Fee field on the Options tab. If this field is completed, the Price fields in the Labor, Inventory, Materials and Subcontractor tabs will be forced to 0. When a work order invoice is generated, the Fixed Price will be written to the Other tab.
  </p>
  <p style="margin-left: 8px;">
    <font style="font-weight: bold;">Rate Schedule Id:</font><br/>
    The default Rate Schedule for generating this quote. If you the completed the Work Order Id field, this field defaults from the Job associated with the Work Order. If this field is completed, the Gross Margin and Percent Markup fields must remain blank.
  </p>
  <p style="margin-left: 8px;"><span>If completed, this field provides the default for the Options associated with this Quote.  It may be overridden on the Option Tab.</span></p>
  <p style="margin-left: 8px;">
    <font style="font-weight: bold;">Gross Margin Percent</font>:<br/>
    The Gross Margin Percent to apply to costs associated with this Quote. If this field is completed, the Rate Schedule and Percent Markup fields must remain blank.
  </p>
  <p style="margin-left: 8px;"><span>If completed, this field provides the default for the Options associated with this Quote.  It may be overridden on the Option Tab.</span></p>
  <p style="margin-left: 8px;">
    <font style="font-weight: bold;">Markup Percent</font>:<br/>
    The Percent Markup to associate with cost entered to complete this Quote. If this field is completed, the Rate Schedule and Gross Margin fields must remain blank.
  </p>
  <p style="margin-left: 8px;"><span>If completed, this field provides the default for the Options associated with this Quote.  It may be overridden on the Option Tab.</span></p>
  <p><img alt="image\ApproveAll_new.gif" border="0" height="28" src="assets/images/image/ApproveAll_new.gif" title="image\ApproveAll_new.gif" width="88"/> The Approve All button provides a shortcut for setting Open, Printed and Accepted options to Approved.  When pushed, the system prompts for confirmation...&#39;Set ALL Open, Printed and Accepted Scope options to Approved?&#39;. If you click Yes the options will be approved.</p>
  <p class="Reference_Line" style="margin-bottom: 0.00pt;"><img alt="image\SKIN1_ComputeRevAdjust.gif" border="0" height="28" src="assets/images/image/SKIN1_ComputeRevAdjust.gif" title="image\SKIN1_ComputeRevAdjust.gif" width="88"/> The Adjust Revenue button works in conjunction with the Revenue Adjustment field(s) on the Scope tab. If a Revenue Adjustment (of type total) field is completed, clicking this button will automatically generate entries to the RevAdjust tab. Since any previous revenue adjustment entries will be deleted, the system will ask you to confirm the deletion before proceeding with the new adjustments.</p>
  <p><img alt="image\ViewRecap_new.gif" border="0" height="28" src="assets/images/image/ViewRecap_new.gif" title="image\ViewRecap_new.gif" width="88"/> Click this button to view/print the Quote Recap report.</p>
  <p><img alt="image\PrintQuote_quote.gif" border="0" height="28" src="assets/images/image/PrintQuote_quote.gif" title="image\PrintQuote_quote.gif" width="88"/> Click this button to print the Quote Report specified in the Report Id field. If you elect to e-mail this form, the Client Site E-mail Address will be defaulted into the To: field. See <a href="Registry_Entry_System_Email.htm">Registry Entry System Email</a> for information on e-mail configuration.</p>
  <p><img alt="image\PrintChangeOrder.gif" border="0" height="28" src="assets/images/image/PrintChangeOrder.gif" title="image\PrintChangeOrder.gif" width="88"/> Use this button for change order management with construction-type jobs. When clicked, this button will automatically call the Report Change Order (this report MUST be installed for this functionality to work0. The Create CO button on the Quote’s Option lines may be used to create the Change Order itself.</p>
  <p style="margin-left: 36.00pt;">
    <font style="font-weight: bold;">Tip:</font> When the Change Order is approved, the Quote Approval Wizard’s Create Job Budget Option may be used to generate Job Budget Tab entries to the Change Order. Alternately, the standard Export to Work Order option may be used to manage the work in the field.
  </p>
  <p><img alt="image\VendorApproval_new.gif" border="0" height="28" src="assets/images/image/VendorApproval_new.gif" title="image\VendorApproval_new.gif" width="88"/> Click this button to email the <a href="Vendor_Approval_Form.htm">Vendor Approval Form</a>. If Outlook is enabled in the sys-email registry entry, the regular SAM Pro email form will appear when the Vendor Approval button is clicked.</p>
  <p><img alt="image\ApprovalWizard_new.gif" border="0" height="28" src="assets/images/image/ApprovalWizard_new.gif" title="image\ApprovalWizard_new.gif" width="88"/> Unless a registry entry is enabled to automatically launch the Wizard when the Quote is saved, the user will set one or more scopes to ‘Approved’, save the Quote, and then click the Approval Wizard button to run the wizard. See <a href="Quotemaster_Approval_Wizard.htm">Quotemaster Approval Wizard</a> for help on using the Wizard.</p>
  <p>
    <font style="font-weight: bold;">Tax Group Id:</font>
    <font style="font-weight: bold;">Tax Status:</font><br/>
    The Tax Group Id and an appropriate Tax Status should be selected. The Tax Group Id defaults as follows:
  </p>
  <p style="margin-left: 36.00pt;">If there is a source Work Order, the Sales Tax Group and Status from the WO&#39;s Job default.</p>
  <p style="margin-left: 36.00pt;">If there is no source Work Order, but a Job is selected, the Sales Tax Group/Status default from the Job.</p>
  <p style="margin-left: 36.00pt;">If there is NO lead Work Order or Job, or the Sales Tax Group in the lead wo&#39;s job was blank, Sales Tax Group defaults from the Client Site&#39;s COP tab.</p>
  <p style="margin-left: 36.00pt;"><span style="font-weight: bold;">NOTE:</span><span> These fields are only used for determining estimate tax on the Quote report. When the Approval Wizard is run, the Tax Group and Tax Status in the selected Job are now used when generating Work Order detail lines. </span> </p>
  <p>
    <font style="font-weight: bold;">Sales Rep Id:</font><br/>
    The Sales Rep for this Quote. This field defaults from the primary Sales Rep in the Site record, but may be changed by the user if needed.
  </p>
  <p>
    <font style="font-weight: bold;">WorkCode Id:</font><br/>
    If you entered the Work Order Id field, this field will default from the Work Code associated with the Work Order. If the quote is approved, this field will be used by the Approval Wizard to supply the header (and Equipment line) Work Code for new Work Orders that are generated by this process.
  </p>
  <p style="margin-left: 8px;"><span>When the Approval Wizard writes back to the source Work Order, the Work Code on existing Equipment tab entries is retained. The Work Code from this field is used on any newly generated Equipment lines.</span></p>
  <p>
    <font style="font-weight: bold;">Cost Category Id:</font><br/>
    A valid Cost Category with the Cost Type set to Other. This field will be used when the system generates the Other tab line for Fixed fee quotes.
  </p>
  <p>
    <font style="font-weight: bold;">Service Category Id:</font><br/>
    This optional field defaults from the Work Code, and specifies the Service Category this quote is related to. If completed, it is used by the system to filter the Equipment that may be selected on the Options and Equipment tabs (unless this functionality has been disabled via the <a href="Registry_Entry_Quotemaster.htm">Registry Entry for Quotemaster</a> ).
  </p>
  <p><span>When creating a new Work Order from the Approval Wizard, the Quote&#39;s Service Category (if completed) will be used to set the Work Order&#39;s Service Category. If the Quote&#39;s Service Category is empty, the new Work Order&#39;s Service Category will continue to be set based on the Work Code.</span></p>
  <p>
    <font style="font-weight: bold;">Estimator Id:</font><br/>
    The Estimator Id defaults from the Quote&#39;s Job anytime the Job is changed/added.  This includes both direct edits of the Quote&#39;s Job Id as well as any indirect methods for changing the Job Id, for example, changing the Work Order Id.
  </p>
  <p><span style="font-weight: bold;">Account Manager Id:</span><span><br/>
      When a Quote is created, the system will default the Account Manager from the Site; it may be changed by the user if needed. When the Approval Wizard is run and a NEW work order is generated, SAMPro uses the Quote&#39;s Account Manager to write to the corresponding field in the newly generated Work Order. </span></p>
  <p>
    <font style="font-weight: bold;">Report Id:</font><br/>
    This field defaults from the Site&#39;s Quote Defaults tab. It specifies the report that should be used to generate the printed (or .pdf) copy of this Quote for the customer. Typically, this would be RQTEFRM.
  </p>
  <p>
    <font style="font-weight: bold;">Billing Address Id:</font><br/>
    If this field is completed, it will be used to set the Invoice Address for the Work Order Invoice generated by the Quotemaster Wizard. If this field is not completed, and this Quote is generated as a result of a source work order, the Billing Address in the Job record will be used for invoicing. Otherwise, the Client Mailing address (referenced in the Job record that you select in the approval process) will be used.
  </p>
  <p>
    <font style="font-weight: bold;">Print Quote Total?</font><br/>
    Check this box (by double-clicking or pressing Spacebar) if you want the total cost of the options printed on the quote report .
  </p>
  <p>
    <font style="font-weight: bold;">Web Viewable CRM?</font><br/>
    This box should be flagged if you would like your Client for be able to view this Quote on FMAnywhere. Clearing the box will prevent the Quote from being displayed on FMAnywhere (for example, if it has not been completed yet).<strong> Note: Documents uploaded through the Web Viewable CRM will always default to viewable, as they come from a web source.</strong>
