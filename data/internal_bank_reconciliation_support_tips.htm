<P class="Support_Heading_2" >Internal Bank Reconciliation Support Tips</P>
 <P class="support" >The following suggestions may help you diagnosis problems if the Bank Reconcilition journal does not balance. </P>
 <P class="support" >You first have to confirm that they ever had a ‘balanced’ starting point  for Bank Recon -&nbsp; and then find out which ‘month’ it FIRST went OUT of balance…</P>
 <P class="support" >If they ‘don’t know’ then you have them do this month, by month, by month for the Bank Acct&nbsp; (use filter to only show Bank Recon Jrnl’s for a given bank acct &nbsp;&amp; compare to Bank Recon Report for same month(s)).</P>
 <P class="support" >Re:&nbsp; Bank Recon report – page 1 is reading DIRECT from GL…..&nbsp; They can’t use manual GL Journal Entry and expect BANK Recon to tie out.</P>
 <P class="support" >When running Bank Recon report, for a Bank Acct &nbsp;– date range = ACCOUNTING Period range - so I hope Acct Period = Statement Period</P>
 <P class="support" >ALL Bank Transfers must be done via Bank Transfer Jrnl, not manual GL Journal Entry.</P>
 <P class="support" >Find out what was done with any ‘outstanding checks’ prior to using bank rec and how handled in SamPro.</P>
 <P class="support" >You can run the AP and AR GL Audit reports to find out if anything posted ‘out of balance’&nbsp; – </P>
 <P class="support" >And/or Research ‘debit’ entries to source ‘AP Journal’ to a BANK acct or ‘credit’ entries to source ‘AR Sales’ to a BANK Acct&nbsp; to determine if VALID or why done</P>
 <P class="support" style="margin-top:0;margin-bottom:0">&nbsp;</P>
 <P class="support" ><FONT style="text-decoration:underline;" >Run AP CHECK register (summary) for a given accounting period to confirm it matches what is in GL for same time frame/bank account. </FONT></P>
 <P class="support" >What I find is that manual checks, EFT &amp; CC/DC transactions (from AP) can create ‘problems’ prior to programming locking down the following:</P>
 <P class="support" >In OLDER versions…&nbsp; </P>
 <P class="support" >They could add an AP entry – code as EFT to bank acct x then change this to bank acct y (which we no longer allow) – check viewer will only show it to bank acct x</P>
 <P class="support" >In OLDER versions…</P>
 <P class="support" >Problems with AP Journal “DELETE” mode&nbsp; – sometimes it did NOT remove the Check in Check Viewer &nbsp;or mark as check as VOID in check viewer </P>
 <P class="support" ><FONT style="font-weight:bold; " >Other Considerations…&nbsp;&nbsp; </FONT></P>
 <P class="support" >Also make sure all Bank Deposit Jrnls = General Ledger source ‘ Deposit’ for Bank Account for same time frame</P>
 <P class="support" >User can enter a AP Invoice and then later change it to an EFT entry – </P>
 <P class="support" >This can be done if they elect to NOT enter a “EFT/Credit TRX id” &nbsp;(I always let system ASSIGN this) – however the system will:</P>
 <P class="support" >Always change the Check Date = ‘existing’ Effective date – so if&nbsp; AP Invoice entered in May but paid by EFT in June AND you want the expense left in May but payment in June – </P>
 <P class="support" >to do this, user must 1. Have MAY accounting period marked as CLOSED and 2. Change acct period &amp; effect date to June date/June Acct Period </P>
 <P class="support" ><FONT style="font-weight:bold; " >For customers who have upgraded from OLD versions….</FONT></P>
 <P class="support" >We are no longer allow users to include ‘after the fact’ trx in Bank Recon – we used </P>
 <P class="support" >To allow changes to a bank recon Jrnl once you’ve reconciled &nbsp;- this is no longer allowed.</P>
 <P class="support" >I had a customer doing this – when I put them on higher version of software, bank recon’s they thought were ‘reconciled’ now show as having an ‘Unreconciled balance’ </P>
 <P class="support" >Nothing we can do about this, except explain what they posted after the fact and why it show’s this.</P>
 <P class="support" style="margin-top:0;margin-bottom:0">&nbsp;</P>
 <P class="support" ><FONT style="font-weight:bold; " >General HELPFUL TOOLS….</FONT></P>
 <P class="support" >In 7.3, we added to various viewers the ability to look up specific transactions for a given BANK ACCOUNT… or find “EFT or CrCard type transactions for a BANK ACCOUNT – I find these</P>
 <P class="support" >Very useful in the CHECK VIEWER or AP JOURNAL and show customer how to pull these lists to help find info.</P>
 <P class="support" >Very useful in the Bank Deposit Jrnl to ONLY show Bank Deposits for x bank acct </P>
 <P class="support" >Same for Bank Transfers or Bank Recon Jrnls – use to ONLY show trx for x bank acct&nbsp; </P>
 <P class="support" style="margin-top:0;margin-bottom:0">&nbsp;</P>
 <P class="support" >Prior to 7.3 (and sometimes in 7.3), I would use these extra ‘filters’ &amp; show customer how to find info:</P>
 <P class="support" >AP Journal Entry Viewer:</P>
 <P class="support" >sql=apjrnl.gl_bnk_glaccnt_rn in (select glaccnt_rn from glaccnt where glaccnt_id = '1002')&nbsp; <FONT style="font-family:'Wingdings'; " >à</FONT> finds all MANUAL checks, EFT for bank acct 1002</P>
