	 line-height: normal; font-size: 10.0pt; font-family: Arial, sans-serif;">The 
 system automatically posts entries to the Sales Journal when an Invoice 
 is successfully posted from the following software modules: Service Work 
 Orders &amp; PM Invoices, Progress Billing, COP (Client Order Processing) 
 &amp; DB-Sell Point (POS-Point of Sale). Auto generated Finance Charges 
 are also posted into the AR Sales Journal.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes;"> </span> This 
 viewer allows you to view / maintain the list of automatic AR Sales Journal 
 transactions, and to create manual Sales Journal entries to record various 
 miscellaneous charges, record credit memos, account for bad debts, and 
 is used to preload outstanding invoices during initial data conversion 
 from a prior system. </p>

<h2>Usage:</h2>
<p><span style="font-weight: bold;">COD Entries:<br/>
</span>The system denies changes to COD type AR Sales Journal entries that 
 have been processed in the Bank Deposit Journal. The user may still use 
 the Credit Memo button to generate a Credit Memo (as this creates a NEW 
 entry). Sales and COD’s are recorded as separate entries in AR History 
 to enable better reporting.</p>
<p><font style="font-weight: bold;">Return Authorizations:<br/>
</font>If you are issuing a Credit Memo for a COP Return Authorization, 
 select Credit Memo first and then enter the RA Id. The Client Id, and 
 the Prices and Costs tabs will be defaulted in for you. When you complete 
 the remaining fields and save this record, the items that were received 
 on the RA will be returned to inventory. Click <a href="Return_Authorization_Viewer.htm">Return 
 Authorization Viewer</a> for additional information.</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: bold;">Credit Memos:</span><br/>
When generating Credit Memos, the Sales Journal now posts Labor, Material, 
 Other and Subcontractor &#39;revenue adjustments&#39; as earned revenue in Job 
 Cost History. This was implemented to prevent the inadvertent generation 
 of invoiced and earned amounts that are out of synch.</p>
<p><font style="font-weight: bold;">AR Deposits, Prepays and Retainers:</font><br/>
Click <a href="AR_Deposits_Prepays_Retainers.htm">AR Deposits, Prepays, 
 Retainers</a> for a step-by-step description of how to handle these items.</p>
<p>See <a href="Bad_Debt_Processing.htm">Bad Debt Processing</a> for details 
 on this topic.</p>
<p><font style="font-weight: bold;">Bank Deposit Journal<br/>
</font>AR Sales Journal Transactions that contain Receipt activity that 
 has subsequently been deposited in the Bank Deposits Journal cannot 
 be reversed; a message to that effect is provided if the user attempts 
 to do so.</p>

<p style="margin-left: 36.00pt;"><font style="font-weight: bold;">Tip: 
 Fixing a COD Work Order with a Bad Payment</font></p>
<p style="margin-left: 36.00pt;"><font style="font-weight: bold;">Import 
 Note:</font> the following Tip is only applicable if a Cash Receipt Journal 
 Entry are NOT generated for COD’s (a registry entry is required for this 
 behavior. The default is to create a Cash Receipt AND Sales Entry.</p>
<p style="margin-left: 36.00pt;">When a COD Work Order is saved, a Sales 
 Journal will automatically be written by the system, crediting the applicable 
 sales account and debiting the GL Account specified on this tab for the 
 payment received. If it turns out this was a bad payment (e.g, NSF check), 
 you may use the following procedure to account for this situation.</p>
<p style="margin-left: 36.00pt;">1) If the check was deposited, you may 
 or may not want to remove it from the deposit journal. If you do, the 
 check will become available for deposit forever into the future.</p>
<p style="margin-left: 36.00pt;">2) You will need to manually create a 
 <font style="text-decoration: underline; ">new</font> AR Sales Journal 
 entry to ‘reverse’ the effect of the cash receipts portion of the entry 
 generated by the system.</p>
<p style="margin-left: 88px;"><span style="text-indent: 30.25pt;">In the 
 AR Sales Journal Header:</span></p>
<p style="margin-left: 102.25pt;">- Enter the Client Id of the customer 
 who made the bad payment</p>
<p style="margin-left: 102.25pt;">- Reference the original Invoice Id, 
 but add NSF (or other initials) to the original Id to notify that this 
 was from non-sufficient funds.</p>
<p style="margin-left: 102.25pt;">- Specify a current accounting period 
 and if possible match the invoice date from the original invoice for aging.</p>
<p style="margin-left: 66.25pt;">On the AR Sales Prices Tab</p>
<p style="margin-left: 102.25pt;">- On the Prices tab, enter the amount 
 of the invoice and the GL account used for the bank checking account (if 
 you did not reverse the deposit journal) or use the Sweep account (if 
 you did reverse the deposit.)</p>
<p style="margin-left: 36.00pt;">3) Save your AR Sales Journal Entry.</p>
<h2>Range Viewer:</h2>
<p>Since multiple GL accounts are present in the ‘parent’ table of this 
 journal, simple range filters (where you simply enter the GL Account Id) 
 do not work for these &quot;encapsulated&quot; fields. To enable the user 
 to filter on a specific parent GL Account, special filter ranges with 
 the necessary SQL to filter on a specific GL Account have been added to 
 the range filter. For example, when you first access the Range screen, 
 the GL Bank Account range will be completed as follows:</p>
<p style="margin-left: 36.00pt;"><font style="font-weight: bold;">GL Bank 
 Account Id:<br/>
</font>sql= gl_bnk_glaccnt_rn in (select glaccnt_rn from glaccnt where 
 glaccnt_id like &#39;%&#39;)</p>
<p>Suppose that your firm uses more then one Bank Account. To filter Entries 
 for a specific GL Bank Account, simply replace the % in the SQL statement 
 with the GL Bank Account Id you wish to filter on. For example, to filter 
 on the GL Bank Account Id 1005, simply change the SQL statement in the 
 range to:</p>
<p style="margin-left: 36.00pt;">sql= gl_bnk_glaccnt_rn in (select glaccnt_rn 
 from glaccnt where glaccnt_id like &#39;<font style="font-weight: bold;">1005</font>&#39;)</p>
<p style="margin-left: 36.00pt;"><font style="font-weight: bold; text-decoration: underline; ">Tip: 
 Saving Ranges</font></p>
<p style="margin-left: 36.00pt;">Rather than adjust the SQL statement each 
 time you use the filter, you may save your settings as a range. See <a href="Filter_Button.htm#Filter_Save_Range">Save Filter Range</a> for 
 details.</p>

<h2>Important Fields:</h2>
<p><font style="font-weight: bold;">Note:</font> this Help Topic lists 
 the standard configuration of all fields that may be included in this 
 record. If you are using a customized system, the fields displayed on 
 your screen may not exactly match the order or status (required, optional, 
 default, display-only, hidden, etc.) of the fields described in this Topic.</p>
<h2>Upper Section:</h2>
<p class="Tab" style="background-color: #e5e5e5; border-top: 1.50pt solid #000000; 
	 border-bottom: 1.50pt solid #000000; border-left: 1.50pt solid #000000; 
	 border-right: 1.50pt solid #000000;">Main Tab</p>
<p><font style="font-weight: bold;">Job Id:</font><br/>
If you are creating a new transaction that pertains to a Job, enter the 
 Job Id or double-click on this field (or press Alt+F7) to select from 
 the list of Jobs. The Job that you specify must &#39;match&#39; the Client (i.e., 
 the Client Site record referenced in the Job must belong to the Client). 
 A warning message will appear if the client site referenced in the invoice 
 and job do not match.</p>
<p><font style="font-weight: bold;">Client Id:</font><br/>
This field should default when the Job Id is selected. Enter the Client 
 Id if you are creating a new Sales Journal entry that pertains to a specific 
 client but not a specific job.</p>
<p><font style="font-weight: bold;">Invoice Id:</font> (10 character, only 
 . and - special characters)<br/>
A system generated or your user-defined invoice number (leading blanks 
 are not allowed). If you enter an Invoice Number that has already been 
 used, the system displays a message informing you that this number has 
 already been used. Validation denies changes to the Invoice Id’s for previously 
 posted AR Sales entries and insures that the specified Invoice Id must 
 be appropriate for users’ security settings.</p>
<p style="margin-left: 36.00pt;"><font style="font-weight: bold;">Credit 
 Memos:</font> The system will update the Invoice Id for you when you click 
 the Create Create Memo button</p>
<p><font style="font-weight: bold;">Invoice Date:</font> (date format mmddyyyy)<br/>
The date as it is to appear on this invoice. Press the Spacebar to enter 
 today&#39;s date, or double-click on this field to access the Calendar viewer.</p>
<p><font style="font-weight: bold;">Period Id:</font><br/>
The Accounting Period flagged as &#39;default&#39; will default to this field when 
 creating a new entry. To select a different Period, enter the Id of an 
 active Accounting Period, or double-click on this field (or press Alt+F7) 
 to select from a list. To create a new Accounting Period, use the right 
 mouse button to double-click on this field to access the standard Accounting 
 Period viewer.</p>
<p><font style="font-weight: bold;">Effective Date:</font><br/>
The date that the entry will alter the appropriate account balances; this 
 field defaults from the Invoice Date. Enter the effective date in <font style="font-style: italic;">mmddyyyy format</font>, or double-click 
 on this field (or press Alt+F7) to access the Calendar viewer, or press 
 Spacebar to enter today&#39;s date. When you save the transaction, the system 
 will verify that the Effective Date falls within the date range defined 
 by the Accounting Period record. In addition, if the Effective Date of 
 the entry falls after the Date Closed (if any) of the Job, a warning message 
 will be displayed.</p>
<p><font style="font-weight: bold;">Period Start Date: Period End Date:</font><br/>
These display-only fields default from the Accounting Period Id. Note that 
 the Effective Date must fall within this range.</p>
<p><font style="font-weight: bold;">Invoice Total:</font><br/>
The amount invoiced, retired, or applied to a credit memo.</p>
<p><font style="font-weight: bold;">Total Entered:</font><br/>
This display-only field is maintained by the system based on the detail 
 specified in the lower portion of the screen. The Total Entered must equal 
 the Invoice Total to record this transaction.</p>
<p><font style="font-weight: bold;">Payment Due Date:</font><br/>
This field is initially calculated by the system based on the AR Terms 
 record in the Job or Client Order record and the Invoice Date, but may 
 be changed by the user if needed. Enter the date due in <font style="font-style: italic;">mmddyyyy 
 format</font>, or double-click on this field (or press Alt+F7) to access 
 the Calendar viewer. If this entry pertains to a Client (but not a Job 
 or Client Order), the Payment Due Date will be set to 30 days from the 
 Invoice Date.</p>
<p><font style="font-weight: bold;">Discount Date:</font><br/>
For sales entries, the day until which the discount is available. For entries 
 for a Job or Client Order, this field will default based on the Invoice 
 Date and Discount Days field in the AR Terms record associated with the 
 Client Order or Job.</p>
<p><font style="font-weight: bold;">Transaction Id:</font><br/>
If you are creating a new transaction, this Id will be generated for you 
 when you save the record. If you wish to correct or reverse an entry, 
 enter its Id.</p>
<p><font style="font-weight: bold;">Transaction Description:</font><br/>
This optional field may be used to briefly describe this transaction.</p>
<p><img src="assets/images/image/ShowInvoice_new.gif" alt="image\ShowInvoice_new.gif" title="image\ShowInvoice_new.gif" width="94" height="28" border="0"/></p>
<p>Click this button to display the invoice which generated this entry.</p>
<p><font style="font-weight: bold;">Currency Id: Currency Factor<br/>
</font>If the Currency Id field is filled in (from the Client record), 
 the amounts you are entering should be in their currency of origin. These 
 foreign amounts will be automatically be converted to your native currency 
 in GL History using the Currency Conversion Factor.</p>
<p><font style="font-weight: bold;">Discount Available:</font><br/>
For sales entries, the discount available if the customer pays by the Discount 
 Date. This field is set automatically for journal entries creating by 
 COP Invoicing.</p>
<p><font style="font-weight: bold;">Tax Group Id:</font><br/>
The Sales Tax Group. For Sales Journal entries generated by automatic invoicing, 
 it is completed when invoices are posted. When entering manual Sales Journal 
 entries, this field now defaults from the Job record to support sales 
 tax reporting.</p>
<p><font style="font-weight: bold;">Entry Type: Sales, Credit Memo,</font> 
 <font style="font-weight: bold;">Debit Memo,</font> <font style="font-weight: bold;">Finance 
 Charge, Bad Debt</font><br/>
Select the correct option for this transaction. To do so, double-click 
 on the radio button adjacent to the desired type or press the Spacebar 
 when the caret is located on the correct button.</p>
<p>The system prevents AR Sales Journal entries from being changed FROM 
 type Credit Memo to type Sales. If the viewer is in Add Mode, the user 
 must re-start the transaction to make a Sales-type entry.</p>
<p><img src="assets/images/image/CreateCreditMemo.gif" alt="image\CreateCreditMemo.gif" title="image\CreateCreditMemo.gif" width="94" height="28" border="0"/></p>
<p>Clicking this button will generate a Credit Memo for the associated 
 Sales Journal entry.  Use of this new functionality is limited 
 to existing transactions with an Entry Type of &#39;Sales&#39;. </p>
<p>Validation has been added so that you cannot press the Credit Memo Button 
 with a GL Account in the Cash Receipts field (generated by a COD entry).</p>
<p>When this button is pushed, the system will execute the following:</p>
<p style="margin-left: 36.00pt;">1. Ask the user to confirm that they wish 
 to create a Credit Memo.</p>
<p style="margin-left: 36.00pt;">2. Switch the transaction mode from Change 
 to Add.</p>
<p style="margin-left: 36.00pt;">3. Revise the Invoice Id by appending 
 the letters &#39;CM&#39; to the existing Invoice Id.  If the Invoice 
 Master table already has a record for the new Invoice Id, then try &#39;CM2&#39;, 
 &#39;CM3&#39;, etc.</p>
<p style="margin-left: 36.00pt;">4. Set the Entry Type to &#39;Credit Memo&#39;.</p>
<p style="margin-left: 36.00pt;">5. Set the Accounting Period Id to the 
 default period.</p>
<p style="margin-left: 36.00pt;">6. Set the Invoice Date to the current 
 system date as long as it satisfies the Accounting Period&#39;s date specifications.  If 
 the current date doesn&#39;t work, use either the Start or End date from the 
 Accounting Period depending on which is closer to the current date.</p>
<p style="margin-left: 36.00pt;">7. Clear the Transaction Id so that the 
 user can save the new transaction.</p>
<p style="margin-left: 36.00pt;">8. Clear the Cost Billed on the child 
 tab.</p>
<p style="margin-left: 36.00pt;"><font style="font-weight: bold;">Important 
 Note: Partial Credit Memos with Sales Tax<br/>
</font>It is important that users manually 
 update lines if a partial credit will be taken: the system will warn display 
 a warning if Sales Tax exists. If you create a credit memo
