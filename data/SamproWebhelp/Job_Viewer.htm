<h1>Job Viewer</h1>
<h2>Purpose:</h2>
<p>Create and maintain the job records that your company uses to track 
 costing information. Basically, a job is a collection point for costs 
 incurred at a client site (or as overhead for your company). Refer to 
 the <a href="Job_Overview.htm">Job Overview</a> for information on related 
 records and procedures.</p>
<p><font style="font-weight: bold;">Note: Jobs and Budgets</font><br/>
If you enter Budgets with your Jobs, the Job Progress viewer and Project 
 Manager&#39;s Workbench will allow you to directly adjust the Percent or Cost 
 to Complete as the Job progresses.</p>
<h2>Usage:</h2>
<p>See <a href="Payroll_Tax_Reciprocity.htm">Payroll Tax Reciprocity</a> 
 for details on setting up jobs where the field employees do not reside 
 in the Job’s Taxing Authority.</p>
<p>You must create at least one Job Cost Code and Billing Item for each 
 job.</p>

	<p>In addition to the fields calculated by SAM Pro, the following fields 
	 are used to complete the informational sections of the standard construction 
	 (AIA-style) invoices:</p>
	<p style="margin-left: 36.00pt;">To Owner:  Job Invoice Name,

<p><font style="font-weight: bold;"><a data-target="POPUP651653488" data-rhwidget="DropSpot" href="#" class="dropspot"><span data-open-text="true" data-skip-index="true">Clients

 and Sites Linked by Jobs</span></a></font></p>
<div data-targetname="POPUP651653488">
	<p>Jobs for a specific site may be billed to a variety of clients since 
	 the Site and the Client are independently specified in the Job record.</p>
	<p style="margin-left: 36.00pt;"><font style="font-weight: bold;">Residential 
	 Example:</font></p>
	<p style="margin-left: 72.00pt;">A new owner purchases a home you have 
	 been servicing. It this case, you would create a new Client record, 
	 and point any applicable, existing Jobs would to the new Client. A 
	 complete record of work performed at this site would be retained.</p>
	<p style="margin-left: 36.00pt;"><font style="font-weight: bold;">Warranty 
	 Example:</font></p>
	<p style="margin-left: 72.00pt;">Suppose that some of the equipment 
	 at a Site is under manufacturer warranty. Warranty Jobs for this equipment 
	 can be pointed at (and billed to) the manufacturer of the equipment 
	 rather than the owner of the Site. Warranty jobs are usually setup 
	 without a client site reference. This allows these jobs to be used 
	 for multiple sites. <font style="font-weight: bold;">However, in the 
	 case of Payroll a warranty job per Payroll Taxing Authority must be 
	 setup to properly withhold tax for employees working on these jobs.</font> 
	 Example (Warranty jobs: TRANE-OH, TRANE-PA, …)</p>
	<p style="margin-left: 36.00pt;"><font style="font-weight: bold;">Construction 
	 Example:</font></p>
	<p style="margin-left: 72.00pt;">Consider a construction job for a 
	 school. Jobs at this site might be pointed at client records for: 
	 the school district, the contractor of record, and the manufacturer 
	 of the equipment being installed.</p></div>

<p><font style="font-weight: bold;">Client Id: Site Id:<br/>
</font>The Client and Site Id&#39;s are specified independently. The <font style="font-weight: bold;">Site specifies the</font> <font style="font-weight: bold;">location</font>

 internal sales tax processing will be used to generate sales or use tax 
 on invoices for this job. If the Avalara Web Integration is enabled and 
 this field is completed with an Avalara Tax Group, the Avalara Web Service 
 will be used to compute sales tax. If this field is blank, it will be 
 completed when the Job is invoiced for the first time using the Avalara 
 Web Integration if it is implemented via registry.</span><span> </span></p>
<p style="margin-left: 36.00pt;"><font style="font-weight: bold;">Note:</font> 
 If the Tax Group Tax field is changed on an existing record, when the 
 Save button is pressed the system now reviews Job History lines and set 
 all lines for this job that do NOT have an AR Invoice ID or are of Tax 
 Type Use to &#39; n/a&#39; (space n/a) so that they will be successfully re-evaluated 
 at invoice time.</p>

 </span></p>
<p><font style="font-weight: bold;">Tax Status:</font> Unknown Use Sales 
 Exempt<br/>

<div data-targetname="POPUP542292731">
	<p style="margin-left: 36.00pt;">The Tax Type Id will be set to unknown 
	 (&#39; n/a&#39;) for jobs with an unknown tax status. Once the status of the 
	 Job has been changed from Unknown to Sales or Exempt, Job and Service 
	 Invoicing can be run, and will successfully evaluate the tax (or exempt 
	 amounts) for the invoice.</p>
	<p style="margin-left: 36.00pt;">If the Job Tax Status fields is changed 
	 on an existing record, when the Save button is pressed the system 
	 now reviews Job History lines and set all lines for this job that 
	 do NOT have an AR Invoice ID or are of Tax Type Use to &#39; n/a&#39; (space 
	 n/a) so that they will be successfully re-evaluated at invoice time.</p>
	<p style="margin-left: 36.00pt;">Validation logic regarding manual 
	 edits of line-item Tax Type Ids so that changes at the line-item level 
	 are not permitted for jobs with an Unknown tax status.</p>
	<p style="margin-left: 72.00pt;">When job tax is &#39;sales&#39;, valid types 
	 are &#39;sales&#39; &#39;n/a&#39; &#39;prepaid&#39;<br/>

	<p style="margin-left: 36.00pt;">Note that the system may default in 
	 a tax type of ‘mixed’ but the user is not allowed to select this type. 
	 Note that the system would generate the ‘mixed’ type if, for example, 
	 a sales tax group was comprised of two authorities, one of whom taxed 
	 Other item, and one of whom did not.</p></div>
<p><span style="font-weight: bold;">Date Completed: (Small Jobs Customization 
 Only)</span><br/>
For Jobs with a Contract Type of Small, Costs and Revenues are not recognized 
 until the Date Completed is set. The Job&#39;s Date Completed field is implemented 
 via the v.cus file as a special, non-database field that is used to update 
 a Job User field (specified via registry), ensuring that the Job User 
 field is set to the correct date format.  Note that a revised v.cus 
 file is required to support this functionality.</p>
<p style="margin-left: 8px;"><span style="font-weight: bold;">City  State/Province

 must reference the appropriate Rate Schedule for this currency/customer.</p>
<p><font style="font-weight: bold;">Revenue Adjustment Id:<br/>
</font>If this field is completed, it will default to Work Orders created 
 for this Job. It is used to enable discounts and add-ons to be applied 
 to invoices for labor, material, sub and other items.</p>
<p><font style="font-weight: bold;">Material Price Level:<br/>
</font>This field overrides the material price level (for Unit Price Inventory 
 Items) in the Site record in the following cases:</p>
<p style="margin-left: 36.00pt;">1. When a Work Order is created in New 
 Call or via Create PM Work Orders, the Price level defaults from the Job 
 (if set); if not, it will default from the Client Site record. Note that 
 the Price Code, if present, always comes from the Site.</p>
<p style="margin-left: 36.00pt;">2. If you specify a Job on a PO, the field 
 Material Price level in the Job record overrides the material price level 
 in the Site record when revenue is calculated. Note that you must click 
 the Magnify button to view Revenue</p>
<p style="margin-left: 72.00pt;"><font style="font-weight: bold;">Foreign 
 Currency Processing</font><font style="font-weight: bold;">:<br/>

 the appropriate Price Level for this currency/customer.</p>
<p><font style="font-weight: bold;">Project Id:</font><br/>
This optional field enables you to group together related jobs for reporting 
 purposes (e.g., group jobs by client). Note that jobs assigned to a particular 
 project need not be for the same client. Press Alt+F7 (or double-click 
 on this field) to display a list of projects to choose from.</p>
<p><font style="font-weight: bold;">Branch Id:<br/>
</font>If Branches are implemented on your system, enter the Id of the 
 Branch responsible for this Job, or double-click to select from a list. 
 If this Job was cloned via the Clone Job button it will be set from the 
 template Job <span>unless a registry is enabled to set if from the selected 
 Site record; see <a href="Registry_Entry_Job_and_Job_Cloning.htm">Registry 
 Entry Job and Job Cloning</a>.</span></p>
<p><font style="font-weight: bold;">Job Source Id:</font><br/>

Enter a letter or number that denotes the billing cycle for this Job (e.g., 
 m=monthly, b=bi-weekly, q=quarterly, etc.). Alternately, this field may 
 be used to specify that invoices for this job should be reviewed by a 
 particular individual or department (j=Jean&#39;s Invoices, s=Service Invoices, 
 etc.). This field is referenced during the compute and post functions 
 to enable you to select which invoices to compute or post.</p>
<p><font style="font-weight: bold;">SIC Id:<br/>
</font>This optional field is used for reporting purposes to track the 
 SIC (standard industrial classification code) code for this job. Enter 
 the Id or double-click to select from a list.</p>
<p><font style="font-weight: bold;">Workers Comp State Id:<br/>
</font>This field is used to determine how the system should set the Worker’s 
 Comp Category for hours entered in the Labor Journal, Work Order, and 
 Remote Time Entry screens. If this is a Job that is performed in the field, 
 you would typically select the Workers Comp State Id that corresponds 
 to the state in which the Job is being done.</p>
<p>When hours are entered, the system looks at the Employee record’s Work 
 Type to see how it is marked:</p>
<p style="margin-left: 36.00pt;"><font style="font-weight: bold;">If the 
 Employee Work Type is marked as Field:<br/>
</font> It looks at the Job Cost Category that is selected, and then at 
 the Job’s Workers Comp State ID. Using this information, it then looks 
 at the WorkersComp tab of the Job Cost Category and pulls in the Workers 
 Comp Category that matches the WorkersComp State pulled from the Job.</p>
<p style="text-indent: 30.25pt;">Note: In the Job Cost Category, you cannot 
 have more than 1 WorkersComp Category per state.</p>
<p style="margin-left: 36.00pt;"><font style="font-weight: bold;">If the 
 Employee Work Type is marked as Office:</font> <font style="font-weight: bold;"><br/>
</font>It uses the WorkersComp Category in the employee record as the default.</p>
<p><font style="font-weight: bold;">Overhead?</font><br/>
This box should be checked to indicate that this is an overhead job. It 
 is used in conjunction with the Overhead Pay Type field in the Employee 
 record to default the Pay Type for Labor Journal and Labor Journal Remote 
 entries correctly.</p>
<p style="margin-left: 8px;">By default, the user is warned when changing 
 the Overhead? flag on a Job which has non-zero Job History based on the 
 JCH Hours, Quantity, Total Cost and Total Revenue fields. A <a href="Registry_Entry_Job_and_Job_Cloning.htm#Registry_Job_Prevent_Overhead_Change">registry 
 entry</a> may be enabled to prevent the user from changing the Overhead? 
 flag for Jobs with non-zero history.</p>
<p><font style="font-weight: bold;">Lien Waiver Req&#39;d?<br/>
T</font>his field should be checked if Lien Waivers are required for this 
 Job.  Note that Lien Waiver Processing will only be enabled if both 
 the Vendor and Job require Lien Waivers. The user will be warned when 
 creating a PO or AP Journal entry for a Job which requires Lien Waivers. 
 See <a href="Lien_Waiver_Overview.htm">Lien Waiver Overview</a> for additional 
 information.</p>
<p><font style="font-weight: bold;">Template<br/>
</font>If this field is checked, it indicates that it is a template record 
 that was created for job cloning purposes.  This field may not be 
 cleared in the Job viewer: use the Job Templates viewer to edit Template 
 fields.</p>
<p style="margin-left: 36.00pt;"><font style="font-weight: bold;">NOTE: 
 Turning a Job into a Template</font><br/>
In certain cases, a Job may be turned into a template by a user with access 
 to the Job Template Viewer. However, Jobs that have Recorded Costs or 
 Billings may not be turned into a Template. Several fields, including 
 the Date Opened, Date Closed and PO Number will be cleared in this case. 
 The system displays a warning when a job is set to a template and client 
 or sites are not template records.</p>

 to set the Invoice Status to Ready.</p>
<p class="MsoNormal" style="margin-left: 48px;"><span style="font-weight: bold;">Ready 
 -</span> The Invoice associated with this Job has been updated and is 
 ready to be printed.</p>
<p class="MsoNormal" style="margin-left: 48px;"><span style="font-weight: bold;">Printed 
 –</span> The Job’s current Invoice has been printed and is eligible for 
 posting. Service Invoices are printed and posted via the Start Service

 Invoice 3 or set to Printed in Record Billing Adjustments.\</p>
<p class="MsoNormal" style="margin-left: 48px;"><span style="font-weight: bold;">Posted 
 -</span> The Invoice has been Posted. Progress Invoices are posted via 
 Start Post Job Invoices. Service Invoices are posted during the posting 
 phase of Compute Service Invoice.</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: bold;">PM Next Invoice Status</span><br/>
This display field is with certain Progress Billing Invoice / Project Manager 
 Workbench DBAnalytics. This field is used in conjunction with the Job&#39;s 
 Invoice Status field that already controls the back-office invoicing process. 
 This field has four potential values:</p>
<p style="margin-left: 48px;">The default value is &#39;Unknown&#39;.  This 
 is the value assigned to a new Job. When a Progress Billed Job is posted, 
 the PM Next Invoice Status will be set back to Unknown so that it will 
 be eligible for additional updates in the Billing Analytic.  </p>
<p style="margin-left: 48px;">&#39;PM Review&#39; indicates the PM has started 
 making changes using the Billing Invoices analytic.  In this state, 
 the changes have not been submitted for use by the back office billing 
 processes.</p>
<p style="margin-left: 48px;">&#39;Submitted&#39; indicates the PM has finished 
 preparing for the next invoice and the back office billing processes can 
 begin.  Setting the status to &#39;Submitted&#39; can only be achieved by 
 the PM using the Billing Invoices analytic. The Status will be changed 
 to Submitted when PM indicates he/she is finished with all necessary. 
 The PM is not allowed to make changes the Status has the value of either 
 Submitted or Imported.</p>
<p style="margin-left: 48px;">&#39;Imported&#39; indicates the back office processing 
 has begun.  Specifically, the PM&#39;s designated billing values have 
 been imported into the Billing Items via the Record Billing Adjustments 
 function.  This takes the place of having back office personnel manually 
 enter the PM&#39;s billing values.</p>

 This option is selected by default when data is converted from an earlier 
 version.</p>
<p style="margin-left: 48px;"><span style="font-weight: bold;">Lump:</span> 
 This option would be used to identify Fixed Fee jobs.  Note that 
 the Fixed Fee validation is still performed at the Billing Item level.</p>
<p style="margin-left: 48px;"><span style="font-weight: bold;">T&amp;M:</span> 
  This option would be used to identify Time and Material Jobs.  Note 
 that validation is still performed at the Billing Item level.</p>
<p style="margin-left: 48px;"><span style="font-weight: bold;">GMP Contract:</span> 
 When GMP Contract is selected, the maximum price for the Job as a whole 
 must not exceed the sum of the Contract values in its Billing Items / 
 Change Orders which are flagged as Include in GMP. If the sum of the Billing 
 Item / Change Order values was exceeded (and Include in GMP is flagged) 
 , a Job Journal entry will be generated via when Record Billing Adjustments 
 saved if the Job is brought back into compliance.</p>
<p style="margin-left: 48px;"><span style="font-weight: bold;">GMP Sov:</span> 
 When GMP SoV is selected, the maximum price for each Billing Item / Change 
 Order flagged as Include in GMP must not be exceeded.</p>

 to Use the Job Date Completed</a> instead of the Date Closed as a trigger 
 in Job EOM for Small Jobs. </p>
<p style="margin-left: 48px;">By default, if the Job&#39;s Contract Type is 
 set to Small Job, Start Job EOM will automatically use a special WIP method 
 that will accrue revenue and costs until the Job Date Closed or Completed 
 field is manually set by a user. Validation logic prevents a user from 
 changing the Job Date Closed on Small Jobs if it is not blank and the 
 Job EOM function has been executed for the job.</p>
<p style="margin-left: 48px;">If the job is closed in the current EOM period 
 (Job Date Closed not blank) the Start Job EOM will attempt to recognize 
 any unbilled revenue for this job (Contract amount from billing items), 
 reversing this transaction in the 1st day of the next accounting period.  When 
 the job is billed complete no further Job EOM process takes place.</p>

<p>When <a href="Intercompany_Processing_Overview.htm">Intercompany Processing</a> 
 is enabled, the GL Entities specified in the Job record MUST reference 
 the same Company as the GL Entities specified in its Cost Codes. Validation 
 will not allow the GL Entity to be changed to one referencing a different

 three Entities on the Job&#39;s Financial tab belong to the same Company. 
 Whenever any one of the Entities on the Job&#39;s Financial tab is changed, 
 the system  uses it as a default to set each of the other two Entities

 information similar to what is available on the Project Manager Summary 
 Report. This tab also includes Aged AR and Budget information.</p>
