<h1>Job Billing Item Change Request</h1>
<h2>Purpose:</h2>
<p style="margin-left: 8px;">When changes to a Job are required but not 
 yet approved, Change Requests (CORs) may be created for budgeting / reporting 
 purposes prior to their approval. They may also be used to accumulate 
 costs. When a Change Request is approved, it may be converted to or attached 
 to a Change Order for billing and costing;  budgets included on the 
 Change Request will be added to the Job&#39;s Budget tab during this process. 
 Any accumulated T&amp;M revenue will receive offsetting postings 
 if it is converted to Fixed Fee. <span style="font-weight: bold;">Note 
 that it is up to the user to specify an appropriate Contract Amount on 
 the new/revised Fixed Fee Billing Item.</span>  </p>
<p>Budgets entered on the Change Request&#39;s BudgetEntry tab will be used 
 to generate corresponding entries to the Job&#39;s Budget tab at 100% likelihood. 
 <span style="font-weight: bold;">Once the Change Request has been converted 
 it is the user&#39;s responsibility to access it from the Job Billing Change 
 Order viewer in order to complete any necessary fields, including the 
 CO Amount and CO Cost, Invoicing Tab fields, etc.</span>  </p>
<p style="margin-left: 48px;"><span style="font-weight: bold;">Alternative 
 to Converting:</span> Instead of Converting a Change Request, it may be 
 attached to an existing Change Order (using the Job Billing Change Order 
 viewer&#39;s Attach CO Requests button). This allows multiple Change Requests 
 to be combined on the same CO. Any accumulated T&amp;M revenue will receive 
 offsetting postings. <span style="font-weight: bold;">Note that it is 
 up to the user to specify an appropriate Contract Amount on the new/revised 
 Fixed Fee Billing Item.</span>  </p>
<h2>Usage:</h2>
<p>The Billing Item can have 3 different forms:</p>
<p style="margin-left: 48px;">A standard Billing Item (typically created 
 when Job was set up)<br/>
A Change Order Billing Item that Changes a Original Job. (CO)<br/>
A Change Request (COR)</p>
<p style="margin-left: 8px;">Billing Items marked as Change Requests are 
 used for budgeting, NOT for actual billing or  costing.  However, 
 when a Change Request is approved, it may be:</p>
<p style="margin-left: 48px;">Converted to a Change Order via the Convert 
 To CO Button in the Job Billing Item Change Request viewer<br/>
<span style="text-decoration: underline; ">Or</span><br/>
Attached to an existing Job Billing Item Change Order via the Attach CO 
 Requests button in the Job Billing Item Change Order viewer</p>
<p style="margin-left: 8px;">Charge Request Amounts represent the values 
 requested, not necessarily the values approved.  <span style="font-style: italic; 
															 font-weight: bold;">It 
 is the user&#39;s responsibility to manually enter all appropriate values 
 when converting or attaching to a Change Order!</span></p>
<p style="margin-left: 8px;">Budgets entered on the Change Request&#39;s BudgetEntry 
 tab will be used to generate corresponding entries to the Job&#39;s Budget 
 tab when a Change Request is converted or attached to a Change Order.</p>
<p>Open Change Requests will be included in Job EOM Processing.  They 
 are treated as Fixed Fee with the Contract Amount adjusted by Percent 
 Likelihood. Change Requests will be processed by the EOM function if:</p>
<p style="margin-left: 48px;">Date Approved &amp; Date Declined = 1900-01-01 
 <br style="margin-bottom: 0px; color: #000000; font-family: Verdana, &#39;Helvetica Neue&#39;, Helvetica, Arial, sans-serif;

<p><font style="font-weight: bold;">CO Amount:  Expected Cost:</font><br/>
These field may be completed in two different ways: </p>
<p style="margin-left: 48px;">They may be maintained by the system based 
 on the Change Request&#39;s Budget Tab entries.</p>
<p style="margin-left: 48px;">They may be manually updated if no Budget 
 lines are present in the Change Request. If Budget lines are added, the 
 Budget lines will overwrite the manually entered CO Amount and Expected 
 Cost values on the Change Request&#39;s Main Tab when the record is saved. 
  </p>
<p>Note that it may be necessary to save the record and then Refresh the 
 display to see the changes.</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: bold;">% Likelihood:</span><br/>
How likely this Change Order Request is to be approved, entered as a percentage. 
 This field controls how lines from the Budget Tab are written to Job History. 
 If the Likelihood is changed as the Job progresses, the appropriate changes 
 to the Job History budget will be generated.  </p>
<p style="margin-left: 48px; text-decoration: underline; ">Example:</p>
<p style="margin-left: 48px;">% Likelihood = 50   CO Amount: 
 1000   Expected Cost:550<br/>

<span style="font-weight: normal;">The date this Change Order Request was 
 asked for.</span></p>
<p><font style="font-weight: bold;">CO Date Approved:</font><br/>

 Request is converted to a Change Order or attached to a Change Order.</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: bold;">CO Date Declined:</span><br/>

 When the Change Request has been converted, it will no longer be displayed 
 in this viewer; it must be accessed via the Job Billing Item Change Order 
 viewer.</p>

<h2>Important Fields: Lower Section</h2>
<p class="Tab">Budget Entry Tab</p>
<p>Entries made in this tab will be written to Job History with a source 
 journal of JBI Budget. Edits and changes to these lines will also be written 
 to Job History. The Likelihood % field (see above)controls how lines from 
 the Budget Tab are written to Job History. If the Likelihood is changed 
 as the Job progresses, the appropriate changes to the Job History budget 
 will be generated.  </p>
<p style="margin-left: 48px;"><font style="font-weight: bold;">Editing 
 Budget Entries:<br/>
</font>The BudgetEntry tab functions like the other SAMPro journals. If 
 it is necessary to change a line, simply change it to the desired value 
 and save the record.</p>
<p><font style="font-weight: bold;">Hours:</font> <font style="font-weight: bold;">Quantity:</font><font style="font-weight: bold;"><br/>
</font>The Hours fields should be used to record labor budgets lines, and 
 the Quantity field should be used to record material or other items. On 
 a single line, fill in either the Hours or Quantity field.</p>
<p><font style="font-weight: bold;">Inventory Item:<br/>
</font>This option field would be used if you are budgeting for specific 
 parts. Note that the cost / revenue for this part must be specified by 
 the user; these values will not default from inventory history.</p>
<p><font style="font-weight: bold;">Cost Category:<br/>
</font>Enter (or import) an appropriate Job Cost Category for this line. 
 For example, a Cost Category of type Labor should be selected for Hours 
 entries.</p>
<p><span>This field supports enhanced filtering provided by the Cost Code&#39;s 
 Job Cost Category Usage Filter. Cost Categories are validated relative 
 to Cost Codes if this filtering is in place.</span></p>
<p><font style="font-weight: bold;">Job Cost Code:<br/>
</font> The Cost Code this budget is assigned to.</p>
<p><font style="font-weight: bold;">Unit Cost: Extended Cost:</font><br/>
The Unit Cost must be entered by the user. The system will multiply the 
 Hours or Quantity by the Unit Cost to calculate the Extended Cost. The 
 Likelihood % field controls the cost which is written to Job History. 
 If the Likelihood is changed as the Job progresses, the appropriate changes 
 to the Job History budget will be generated.  </p>
<p><font style="font-weight: bold;">Billing Type: Revenue Rate: Extended 
 Revenue:<br/>
</font>By default, the billing type is set to n/a so that the user can 
 enter the Revenue directly. To have the system calculate the Extended 
 Revenue for you, select a Billing Type and enter a Revenue Rate. The Likelihood 
 % field controls this revenue which is written to Job History. If the 
 Likelihood is changed as the Job progresses, the appropriate changes to 
 the Job History budget will be generated.  </p>
