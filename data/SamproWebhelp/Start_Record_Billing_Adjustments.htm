  <h1>Record Billing Adjustments / Construction Invoicing</h1>
  <h2>Purpose:</h2>
  <p>Enables you to invoice fixed-fee jobs and to adjust other Job Invoices as needed. It is also used for GMP type Jobs.</p>
  <p style="margin-left: 36.00pt;">
    <font style="font-weight: bold;">Construction Billing on Work Orders:</font> Users do not have to mark workorders &#39;Ready to Invoice&#39; for the unbilled costs to appear in Record Billing Adjustments providing the Job&#39;s billing item is FIXED FEE &amp; RININV3 or RININV4. For non-fixed fee Jobs, users must mark these &#39;Ready To Invoice&#39; for them to appear in Record Billing Adjustment (e.g., Time&amp;Material Change Orders).   
  </p>
  <p style="margin-left: 36.00pt;">A registry entry is available to require Fixed Fee unbilled costs to be flagged as Ready to Inovoice in the Work Order: <a href="Registry_Entry_Global_Settings__Column_Compression__Dispatch_Board_Rows__History_Log_Inventory_Markup.htm#Registry_Entry_Global_Settings_Non-Service_Compute_Invoices">Registry Entry Global Settings: Non-Service Compute Invoices</a>.</p>
  <p style="margin-left: 36.00pt;">
    <font style="font-weight: bold;">Security Override:</font> This function recognizes and uses the security and branch override from job registry settings in sys-ffv-global-settings.
  </p>
  <p style="margin-left: 36.00pt;">
    <font style="font-weight: bold;">Intercompany Processing:</font><br/>
    When intercompany processing is enabled, the Company/Security is set for the AR Sales Journal and resulting history records when Progress Invoices are posted.
  </p>
  <p style="margin-left: 36.00pt;">The A/R Control GL Entity is displayed on the Progress Billing Post Report. Although the GL Entities for the Sale Tax entries do not appear on this report, they are written to history correctly.</p>
  <h2>Example:</h2>
  <p>Assume that you have created a fixed-fee Job Billing Item with an original contract amount of $125,000.00, and that you wish to bill for $25,000 of it on June 30, 2016. To do so, you would go into the Record Billing Adjustments function, and enter the $25,000 you wished to bill for on the Billing and General Ledger tabs, check the Invoice Ready box, and finally click the Change Record button.</p>
  <h2>Usage:</h2>
  <p>This function is required for billing fixed fee invoices and GMP type Jobs. It may be used to adjust or compute invoices for all types of Job Invoices. For an overview of the entire invoicing process (not including GMP type Jobs), click on <a href="Job_Invoice_Overview.htm">Job Invoice Overview</a>.</p>
  <p>Job Tax Status and Fixed Fee Billing:</p>
  <p style="margin-left: 36.00pt;">1. Job Tax Status is &#39;Sales&#39; and Fixed Fee Taxable is True, then Fee Amount is &#39;sales taxable&#39;.<br/>
    2. Job Tax Status is &#39;Exempt&#39; and Fixed Fee Taxable is True, then Fee Amount is &#39;tax exempt&#39;.<br/>
    3. In all other cases, Fee Amount is &#39;not taxable&#39;.</p>
  <p style="margin-left: 8px;">Record Billing Adjustments automatically restarts at the Job Id input screen after clicking Save when a <a href="Registry_Record_Billing_Adjustments.htm">registry option</a> is enabled. Clicking the red X on the Job Id initial input screen closes Record Billing Adjustments and it will not automatically reopen.</p>
  <h2>Registry:</h2>
  <p><a href="Registry_Record_Billing_Adjustments.htm">Registry Record Billing Adjustment.</a></p>
  <h2>Initial Screen</h2>
  <p><span style="font-weight: bold;">Job Id:</span><br/>
    When the Initial Record Billing Adjustments screen appears, enter the Id of the Job that you wish to bill for (or double-click to select from a list). If the Job that you selected has been billed previously, the End Date, Computed Thru, Next Invoice Id, and Invoiced Thru fields will be filled in.</p>
  <p><span style="font-weight: bold;">End Date:</span><br/>
    The End Date functions as a cut-off (bill thru) date for T&amp;M charges; charges with effective dates after the End Date will not be included on this invoice! For example, if today&#39;s date was February 10, 2017 but you only wanted to bill thru January 31, 2016 you would enter 01312017 as the End Date. Normally, you would enter a new end date when generating a new invoice. If this is a new job, simply enter the end date.</p>
  <p style="margin-left: 48px;">
    <font style="font-weight: bold;">Note: Rolling Back the Job Date Computed Thru</font><br/>
    The End Date may be set to less than the current Compute Thru date as long as no job history exists with an invoice date greater than (or equal to) the End Date that you enter. When the Job Id and End Date are set correctly click the Go button. The system will compute the outstanding charges for this Job, and then display the Job Invoice viewer main screen.  
  </p>
  <p><span style="font-weight: bold;">Job Tax Status: Unknown - Use - Sales - Exempt</span><br/>
    This function may not be used on jobs with a tax status of Unknown. Update the Job with the correct Tax Status and then rerun this function.</p>
  <p style="margin-left: 8px;"><span style="font-weight: bold;">Invoice Status:</span><br/>
    This field displays the selected Job&#39;s Invoice Status.</p>
  <p style="margin-left: 48px;"><span style="font-weight: bold;">Hold:</span> The Job Invoice has not yet been updated in Record Billing Adjustments so that it is ready to be printed. The Job could have new costs to bill or a reversed invoice to rebill.</p>
  <p style="margin-left: 48px;"><span style="font-weight: bold;">Ready:</span> The Invoice has been processed so that the Invoice is Ready to Print.</p>
  <p style="margin-left: 48px;"><span style="font-weight: bold;">Printed:</span> If you select this option, you may be warned that &#39;Job has printed invoice that has not yet been posted&#39; but will be allowed to continue. This option should only be selected if the invoice has been printed without a print confirmation which auto sets it to printed.</p>
  <p style="margin-left: 48px;"><span style="font-weight: bold;">Posted:</span> Selecting this setting will post the invoice; if it has not been printed (and saved), posting it will means that you will not be able to print this invoice. A <a href="Registry_Record_Billing_Adjustments.htm">registry entry</a> will prevent the user from selecting this option.</p>
  <p><span style="font-weight: bold;">PM Next Invoice Status</span><br/>
    This display field is used in conjunction with certain Project Manager Workbench DBAnalytics: see <span style="font-weight: bold;"><a href="Progress_Billing_Analytic.htm">Progress Billing Analytics</a></span> for details. Validation prevents Jobs with the PM Next Invoice Status set to &#39;PM Review&#39; rom being selected in Record Billing Adjustments. Jobs with the PM Next Invoice Statuses of &#39;Submitted&#39;, &#39;Unknown&#39; and &#39;Imported&#39; (if the Job&#39;s Invoice Status is correctly set) are allowed. The Next PM Invoice Status will be changed from Submitted to Imported when the PM&#39;s designated billing values have been imported and the changes saved in Record Billing Adjustments.  </p>
  <p>To view information on completing the tabs of the Job Invoice/Record Billing Adjustment screen, click on one of the following topics:</p>

  <h2>Important Fields:</h2>
  <p class="Tab">Main Tab</p>
  <p>
    <font style="font-weight: bold;">Invoice Date:</font><br/>
    Enter (or adjust) the Invoice Date in <font style="font-style: italic;">mmddyyyy</font> format or double-click to access the Calendar to help you do so.
  </p>
  <p>
    <font style="font-weight: bold;">Payment Date Due:</font><br/>
    This field will default by adding the Days Due from the Job&#39;s AR Terms Code to the Invoice Date. When the Due Days is zero in the AR Terms record, it uses 30 as a default instead. Note that this defaulting does NOT take place if the Due Date field in Record Billing Adjustments already has a non-blank value. The user may adjust the Date Due (in mmddyyyy format) manually, or double-click to access the Calendar to do so.
  </p>
  <p>
    <font style="font-weight: bold;">Next Invoice Id:</font><br/>
    Calculated by the system. If the user clears this field, they are asked if they meant to clear the field (Click Yes), or if was cleared in error (Click No to restore the field’s original contents).
  </p>
  <p>
    <font style="font-weight: bold;">Next Inv. Sales Tax:</font><br/>
    Calculated by the system when you click the Compute Taxes button. This field may be adjusted by the user if needed.
  </p>
  <p>
    <font style="font-weight: bold;">Invoice Status: Hold -  Ready to Print -  Ready to Post</font><br/>
    This field is automatically set to Hold when you first access this journal. When you have entered all required information on the Main, Billing, Labor, Other, General Ledger or Taxes tabs, and are ready to bill, select the Ready to Print option (if you wish to create a physical or electronic invoice) or the Ready to Post option (if you wish to post to AR without producing an invoice; in this case, the Job Status will be set to Printed).
  </p>
  <p>
    <font style="font-weight: bold;">Compute Taxes</font><br/>
    Click this button if the Tax Status is not Exempt and you want the system to enter the Sales Tax authorities and amounts on the Taxes tab for you. The Cost Code flagged as Default for AR Post (if present) will default when these entries are made; this field should be adjusted by the user if needed.
  </p>
  <p>Validation warns the user if Sales or Use Tax has not been computed when the invoice is saved as Ready to Print. The following warning will be displayed if a sales or use taxable invoice is saved as Ready To Print if there is a Next Invoice Amount but the Taxes tab is blank. In addition, this validation warns the user if Exempt Jobs have not had their Exempt Amount computed when the invoice is set / saved as Ready to Print.  </p>
  <p style="margin-left: 48px;">Warning: Compute Sales Tax has not been Pressed.</p>
  <p style="margin-left: 48px;">Ok to continue?</p>
  <p style="margin-left: 8px;">Click No to return to Record Billing Adjustments to click Compute Sales Tax before saving. If you click Yes to continue, the appropriate entries will NOT be made to the Sales Tax Table which is used for Sales Tax reporting.</p>
  <p><img alt="image\computegl.gif" border="0" height="17" src="assets/images/image/computegl.gif" title="image\computegl.gif" width="77"/></p>
  <p>
    <font style="font-weight: bold;">Compute GL</font><br/>
    Click this button if you want the system to compute the General Ledger entries for you for fixed fee, progress billing.
  </p>
  <p>The Compute GL button understands there might be a GL Income Account in the Cost Category and includes it in the computations. The revenue is allocated to GL Accounts based on the cost codes and/or cost categories that have posted to JCH.</p>
  <p>The Job Cost Code (which will set the GL Account) will default according to the following rules:</p>
  <p style="margin-left: 23.75pt;">1) Budgeted Revenue: If the Job Billing Item being billed has a budget, income will be allocated to the GL Accounts specified in the Cost Codes specified in the budget in the same proportion as the budgeted entries (for example, 60% to Cost Code A, 40% to Cost Code B).</p>
  <p style="margin-left: 23.75pt;">2) Costs Being Billed on Current Invoice: If the Job Billing Item being billed has no budget, allocate the entries based on actual costs on the current invoice.</p>
  <p style="margin-left: 23.75pt;">3) Projected Cost: If you are invoicing before costs, and have no budgeted revenue, the allocation is based on the projected cost to complete of the Billing Item being billed.</p>
  <p style="margin-left: 23.75pt;">4) If the system finds no job history for the Billing Item being billed, the Job Cost Record flagged as Default for AR Post will default.</p>
  <p style="margin-left: 23.75pt;">5) If all of the first four allocation methods fail, the first Cost Code (with the lowest Id) will be selected.</p>
  <p>
    <font style="font-weight: bold;">Description:</font><br/>
