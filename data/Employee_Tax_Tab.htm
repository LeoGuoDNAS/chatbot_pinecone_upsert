<h1>Employee Viewer Taxes Tab</h1>
<h2>Purpose:</h2>
<p>Create and maintain an employee&#39;s list of payroll tax tables for tax 
 calculation and/or withholding.</p>
<h2>Example:</h2>
<p>Federal Married, FUTA, FICA - Medicare, etc.</p>
<h2>Usage:</h2>
<p>This Tab must be completed for each employee if payroll is implemented 
 on your system.</p>
<p><font style="font-weight: bold;">Payroll Tax Reciprocity<br/>
</font>In order to implement Payroll Reciprocity, a line for every tax 
 authority (requiring payroll tax withholding) where an employee might 
 work should be included on the tax tab. The Always Withhold and Residence 
 boxes must be blank for authorities where an employee works but does not 
 live. Click <a href="Payroll_Tax_Reciprocity.htm">Payroll Tax Reciprocity</a> 
 for an overview on this topic.</p>
<h2>Important Fields:</h2>
<p><font style="font-weight: bold;">Table Id:</font><br/>
Enter a valid Tax Table Id (or double-click to select from your firm&#39;s 
 list of Tax Tables). Typically, you would include Federal (married or 
 single), FICA (Medicare and social security), FUTA, SUTA, State and Local 
 tax tables. For Field employees, the default State and Local tax tables 
 are pulled from the Job record of the job being worked on. See <a href="Payroll_Tax_Table_Viewer.htm">Tax 
 Tables</a> for information on the multiple Federal Tax Tables for 2020 
 and pre 2020 W-4 entries. </p>
<p><font style="font-weight: bold;">Always Withhold?<br/>
</font>This box should always be checked for most federal taxes; some exceptions 
 exist for FICA MCAD.</p>
<p style="margin-left: 48px;"><span style="font-weight: bold;">FICA MCAD:</span><br/>
For Versions 8.2 - 9.0, the Medicare Additional (MCAD) for high wage earners 
 should only be checked if the employee&#39;s wages have exceeded $200,000 
 for the current year. See <span style="font-weight: bold;"><a href="Medicare_Additional_Tax_(MCAD).htm">Version 
 9.1 Medicare Additional Tax</a></span> 
 procedures on for details on how to handle this field in 9.1.</p>
<p>For state and local taxes that share a reciprocity agreement, this box 
 should never be checked unless the Residence box is also checked (indicating 
 that the employee is a resident of this taxing authority). This field 
 is used in conjunction with payroll reciprocity and residual tax credits 
 for work performed by residents of this authority in other authorities.</p>
<p>If the Residence box is checked, you may or may not check this box depending 
 on the rules imposed by this authority: contact the appropriate authority 
 to determine which rule applies.</p>
<p style="margin-left: 48px;">1. <font style="font-weight: bold;">Check</font> 
 Always Withhold if taxes should always be withheld for residents of this 
 authority, regardless of where work is performed (double-dipping).</p>
<p style="margin-left: 48px;">2. <font style="font-weight: bold;">Check</font> 
 Always Withhold if a residual tax credit is allowed for wages earned in 
 another state. The residual computation will be calculated during Compute 
 Payroll. Note that the Residual Withholding and Residual Tax Credit % 
 field must be completed in the Tax Authority of residence.</p>
<p style="margin-left: 48px;">3. <font style="font-weight: bold;">Do not 
 check</font> Always Withhold if this tax authority only requires that 
 resident&#39;s tax be withheld for the work site authority.  </p>
<p>Click to <a data-target="POPUP529393109" data-rhwidget="DropSpot" href="#" class="dropspot"><span data-open-text="true" data-skip-index="true">See 
 Examples</span><span data-close-text="true">See 
 Examples</span></a>.</p>
<div data-targetname="POPUP529393109">
	<p style="margin-left: 36.00pt;"><font style="font-weight: bold; text-decoration: underline; ">Examples:</font></p>
	<p style="margin-left: 36.00pt;"><font style="font-weight: bold;">1.</font> 
	 Let&#39;s assume this employee is a resident of Colorado (that requires 
	 only that the worksite state is taxed). Assuming that this employee 
	 might perform work in CO, NM and OK, their tax tab would include the 
	 following state authority entries:</p>
	<p style="margin-left: 66.25pt;">Authority  Always Withhold?  Residence?</p>
	<p style="margin-left: 66.25pt;">CO       X</p>
	<p style="margin-left: 66.25pt;">NM</p>
	<p style="margin-left: 66.25pt;">OK</p>
	<p style="margin-left: 36.00pt;"><font style="font-weight: bold;">2.</font> 
	 Now, let’s assume that the employee resides in New Jersey, and works 
	 in New Jersey, PA and NY. As the following table indicates, New Jersey 
	 requires that tax is always withheld for itself as well as the worksite 
	 state. However, New Jersey holds a reciprocal agreement with PA, and 
	 also provides a residual tax credit for work that New Jersey residents 
	 perform in states other than PA. In this case, the employee&#39;s tax 
	 tab would be filled out as follows:</p>
	<p style="margin-left: 66.25pt;">Authority  Always Withhold?  Residence?</p>
	<p style="margin-left: 66.25pt;">NJ   X    X</p>
	<p class="Normal_Indent" style="margin-left: 66.25pt;">PA</p>
	<p style="margin-left: 66.25pt;">NY</p>
	<p style="margin-left: 36.00pt;">Now let’s look that at how state taxes 
	 would be computed where wages were earned as follows:</p>
	<p style="margin-left: 66.25pt;">Wages Worksite Tax State Tax 
	 Rate W/H</p>
	<p style="margin-left: 66.25pt;">$1000 PA  NJ  3%  $30.00</p>
	<p style="margin-left: 66.25pt;">$1000 NJ  NJ*  3%  $30.00</p>
	<p style="margin-left: 66.25pt;">$1000 NY  NJ**  3%  $10.00</p>
	<p style="margin-left: 66.25pt;">   NY**  4%  $40.00</p>
	<p class="Reference_Line" style="margin-left: 66.25pt; margin-bottom: 0.00pt;">* 
	 NJ gets the tax because of its reciprocal agreement with PA.</p>
	<p style="margin-left: 66.25pt;">** Both New Jersey and New York get 
	 tax - New York at its full rate of 4%. Since New Jersey provides a 
	 50% tax credit for resident&#39;s wages earned in other states, the withholding 
	 for NY will be computed as follows:</p>
	<p style="margin-left: 66.25pt;"> NJ Withholding - (NY Withholding 
	 X Tax Credit %) =</p>
	<p style="margin-left: 66.25pt;"> $30 - ($40 X .50) = $10</p></div>

These fields pertain to the Allowance Categories 1-5 on the Federal FED-S 
 and FED-M (for W-4&#39;s from 2019 and earlier ONLY) and most State Tax Tables. 
 For Federal taxes for Employees with an 2019 W-4 or earlier, the number 
 of allowances the employee specified would be entered in the first Al 
 box. </p>

Instructions for completing the Add&#39;l Tax, Add&#39;l Allow and Add&#39;l Credit 
 fields are described in the Section B BOY Instructions published by Data-Basics 
 in late December for the following year. This document will provide detailed 
 information on how to complete the Employee Tax tab using the information 
 on the W-4. <span style="font-weight: bold;">DO NOT GUESS</span> when 
 completing the Employee Tax tab lines: follow the instructions in the 
 Section B BOY document. This documents may be obtained from Data-Basics 
 support or from the User Forum. </p>
<p>If this line is for a State Tax Table that implements different allowance
