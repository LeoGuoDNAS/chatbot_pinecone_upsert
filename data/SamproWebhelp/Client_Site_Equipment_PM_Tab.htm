<h1>Client Site Equipment - PM Schedule Tab</h1>
<p>This tab is used to create a schedule for PM Workorders. To actually 
 generate the PM Work Orders according to this schedule, the <a href="Create_PM_Work_Order.htm">Create 
 PM Work Order</a> function must be run.</p>
<p>This function is now sensitive to the status of the Site as well as 
 to the Job Date Closed in order to exclude undesirable PM Inspections 
 from creation. The following validations now apply:</p>
<p style="margin-left: 36.00pt;">1. If the Equipment’s Site is not Active, 
 do not create PM Work Orders for it (this also excludes Credit Hold Sites).<br/>
2. If the Job in the Equipment PM schedule has a Job Date Closed that precedes 
 the Inspection Date, do not create a PM Work Order for it.</p>
<p>If a Master Contract (PM Master Schedule) record exists for this equipment, 
 additional entries to this tab will be generated when Create PM Work Orders 
 is run. See <a href="PM_Master_Schedule_Master_Contract_.htm">PM Master 
 Schedule (Master Contract)</a> for details.</p>
<p> <img src="assets/images/SKIN1_PMClone.bmp" alt="" style="border: none;" border="0"/>Clicking 
 this button enables you to clone the PM Schedule from another Equipment 
 record. When you click this button a list of equipment records with PM 
 Schedules eligible to be copied will appear. Equipment will only appear 
 on this list if:</p>
<p style="margin-left: 29.50pt;">- It is from the same Site.</p>
<p style="margin-left: 29.50pt;">- The record is active (the Inactive box 
 is not checked).</p>
<p style="margin-left: 29.50pt;">- It has one or more PM Lines flagged 
 Ok to Renew.</p>
<p style="margin-left: 72.00pt;"><font style="font-weight: bold;">Note:</font> 
 In previous releases, only those PM’s that did not have a work order assigned 
 were copied. In this release, the default functionality is to clone ALL 
 lines that are marked OK to Renew, regardless of whether or not a work 
 order is assigned. See <a href="Registry_Client_Site_Equipment_Viewer.htm">Registry 
 Client Site Equipment Viewer</a> for a registry option to restore previous 
 behavior and ONLY clone PM lines not yet referencing a Work Order Id.</p>
<p style="margin-left: 29.50pt;">- The Billing Items are Fixed Fee or a 
 registry setting is enable to permit the import of non-Fixed Fee items: 
 <a href="Registry_Client_Site_Equipment_Viewer.htm">Registry Client Site 
 Equipment Viewer</a> .</p>
<p>When you select a record from the list and click ‘ok’, its PM Schedule 
 entries will be copied to the current PM Schedule tab. Adjust these lines 
 as needed before saving the record. This function <font style="text-decoration: underline; ">excludes</font> 
 lines referencing a Master Contract. This enables you to set up and copy 
 ‘extra’ PM’s that are not a part of a particular Master Contract.</p>
<h2>Important Fields:</h2>
<p><font style="font-weight: bold;">Inspect Date:</font> (mmddyyyy format)<br/>
Enter an inspection date or double-click on this field (or press Alt-F7) 
 to access the Calendar viewer. To enter today&#39;s date, simply press the 
 spacebar.</p>
<p>When the PM Work Order is generated, the system will automatically writes 
 the Inspection Date to the Date Earliest Start (in the PM Work Order Main 
 tab), and sets the Date Must Complete to the last day of the month specified 
 in the Inspection date.</p>
<p><font style="font-weight: bold;">Est Hrs:</font><br/>
The estimated number of hours required for this inspection. This field 
 defaults from the Service Tasks List record or may be entered by the user.</p>
<p><font style="font-weight: bold;">PM WO Id:<br/>
</font>This display only field will be completed by SAM Pro when PM Work 
 Orders are created. Note that if the user flagged the ‘Already Done’ field 
 on the Create PM Workorder checklist to indicate that this maintenance 
 has already been completed, the system will display  ‘NO WO’ in this 
 field.</p>
<p><font style="font-weight: bold;">Service Tasks Id:</font><br/>
The list of the service tasks to be performed on the equipment at this 
 PM inspection. Double-click on this field (or press Alt+F7) to select 
 from a list of Service Task Ids.</p>
<p><font style="font-weight: bold;">Service Parts Id:</font><br/>
The list of the service parts required at this PM inspection. Double-click 
 on this field to (or press Alt-F7) select from a list of Service Parts 
 Ids.</p>
<p style="margin-left: 36.00pt;"><font style="font-weight: bold;">Required 
 Resource Functionality<br/>
</font>If Required Resource Processing is implemented on your system (either 
 via a customization or registry entry), the Items listed on the Service 
 Parts List specified on the PM Schedule will be written to the Required 
 Resources tab of the work order.</p>
<p><font style="font-weight: bold;">Work Code Id:</font><br/>
Enter a valid Work Code ID for this. The Work Order priority and Name will 
 be set from this Work Code. If more than one piece of equipment at a site 
 is scheduled for the same Work Order on the same day, the priority will 
 be based on the lowest numbered Work Code priority scheduled for that 
 day. When PM WorkOrders are generated, the checklist will appear in the 
 following order:</p>
<p style="margin-left: 48px;"> Client Site<br/>
 Date Scheduled<br/>
 Work Code Priority<br/>
 Equipment Id</p>
<p>If a Work Code is not included in the PM Schedule, the priority of the 
 PM Work Order will default to zero.</p>
<p style="margin-left: 36.00pt;"><font style="font-weight: bold;">Service</font> 
 <font style="font-weight: bold;">Category</font> <font style="font-weight: bold;">Note:</font> 
 If this Work Code references a Service Category, it will serve as the 
 default for the corresponding Service Category field in PM Work Orders. 
 If the Work Code does not reference a Service Category, the PM Work Order’s 
 Service Category will be set from the PM Inspection Equipment record Main 
 tab (if completed).</p>
<p style="margin-left: 36.00pt;"><font style="font-weight: bold;">Multiple 
 Entries for the Same Day</font><font style="font-weight: bold;">:</font> 
 If the Work Code Id is different on two lines of the Client Site Equipment 
 PM Schedule for the same day, the system now forces a separate work order 
 to be created.</p>
<p style="margin-left: 36.00pt;"><font style="font-weight: bold;">Cycle 
 Code Filtering for Metrics/Log Form Entries:<br/>
</font>If the Cycle Code Filter is not set on this line (click the Magnify 
 button to access this field) the Cycle Code Filter will default from the 
 Work Code: see <a href="Log_Form_Viewer.htm">Log Form Viewer</a> for details</p>
<p><font style="font-weight: bold;">Tech Id:</font><br/>
The technician to which this maintenance should be assigned. When the Start 
 Create PM WorkOrder function is run, the system will assign a technician 
 to the PM Work Order based on the following rules:</p>
<p style="margin-left: 36.00pt;">If a technician is attached to the PM 
 Schedule (for with maintenance), use that technician.</p>
<p style="margin-left: 36.00pt;">If no technician is listed on the PM Schedule, 
 use the default technician from the Client Site Equipment record.</p>
<p style="margin-left: 36.00pt;">If no technician is listed on the PM Schedule, 
 or in the Client Site Equipment record, use the technician in the Client 
 Site record. If no technician is found, the work order will be unassigned.</p>
<p><font style="font-weight: bold;">Cn Value:</font><br/>
This field should be used to assign an amount to bill, and will appear 
 as an Other amount on the work order for the job specified on this line 
 of the PM Schedule . This field should <font style="text-decoration: underline; ">not</font> 
 be used in conjunction with a client site billing schedule, as it will 
 result in double billing.</p>
<p style="margin-left: 36.00pt;"><font style="font-weight: bold;">Foreign 
 Currency Processing:</font><font style="font-weight: bold;"><br/>
</font>If this is a foreign customer, this field must be entered in terms 
 of the foreign revenue the customer will be billed in.</p>
<p><font style="font-weight: bold;">Cn Cost:</font><br/>
This optional field can be used to assign a standard visit cost to the 
 job specified on this PM line. Recall, however, that if real costs (labor, 
 materials, etc.) are recorded to the work order, usage of this field may 
 result in over costing.</p>
<p style="margin-left: 36.00pt;"><font style="font-weight: bold;">Foreign 
 Currency Processing:</font><font style="font-weight: bold;"><br/>
</font>This field must be entered in terms of your firm’s local currency, 
 regardless of whether or not the customer is foreign.</p>
<p><font style="font-weight: bold;">Ok to Renew:</font><br/>
Any line(s) flagged as OK to Renew will be copied when the Renew Service 
 Contracts function is run if the Equipment 
 is Active (Inactive is NOT checked). During the Renew Service 
 Contract processing, the new line will then be flagged as Ok to Renew; 
 the older line that was used as a template will have the Ok to Renew field 
 blanked.</p>
<p><font style="font-weight: bold;">Escalation Profile:</font><br/>
If Escalation Management is implemented on your system and this field is 
 filled in, the scheduled events (alarms and or notifications) in the profile 
 will automatically be attached to PM Work Order generated for this scheduled 
 inspection.</p>
<p><font style="font-weight: bold;">Evaluation Table Id:<br/>
</font>This field is used by the system to set the default value for PM 
 Work Orders referencing this equipment. It is used in conjunction with 
 the Service Evaluation Wizard, which will be invoked when the work order 
 is completed or invoiced, and the evaluation results will be written to 
 the work order’s Evaluation tab.</p>
<p><font style="font-weight: bold;">Cost Category</font><br/>
The default Job Cost Category to be used when invoicing PM Workorders. 
 This field supports enhanced filtering 
 provided by the Cost Code&#39;s Job Cost Category Usage Filter. Cost Categories 
 are validated (relative to Cost Codes) during data entry upon leaving 
 the Cost Category Id field.  The full relationship is validated again 
 when leaving a child line or saving a record.</p>
<p><font style="font-weight: bold;">Job Id: Cost Code: Billing Item:</font><br/>
These fields have been added to the PM tab to enable PM Billing to multiple 
 jobs. If these fields are not completed, the Default PM Job fields in 
 the Client Site parent screen will be used as the default Job information 
 when a PM Work Order is generated.</p>
<p>The system warns the user when non-fixed-fee billing items are entered 
 on the PM Schedule tab.</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: bold;">Master Contract Id:</span><br/>
This display field will be completed if this line was generated via Master 
 Contract. Note that lines with a Master Contract Id AND Work Order Id 
 may NOT be edited. </p>
<p>If a PM Schedule line has a Master 
 Contract reference but no WO Id it came from a Master Contract &#39;Build 
 Out&#39; (currently supported only by customization). In this release, the 
 user is allowed to edit these lines in order to assign different Parts 
 and/or Task lists when Create PM WorkOrders is run. </p>
<p><font style="font-weight: bold;">Standard Filters: Belts:<br/>
Pleated Filters: Other:<br/>
</font>These fields reflect the parts types that may be selected from the 
 Service Parts List. Only flagged types will be included in special processing 
 described below.</p>
<h3 style="margin-left: 36.00pt;">Special processing of Service Parts List</h3>
<p style="margin-left: 36.00pt;">The Filters - Pltd Filters - Belts and 
 Other check boxes in the Client Site Equipment record PM tab are supposed 
 to identify which Service Parts List items should be included in PM work 
 orders. These boxes map to the Inventory Type Id in the Service Parts 
 List viewer. SAM Pro uses special processing on the flagged Service Parts 
 items based on whether the Tech assigned to the PM is a Subcontractor 
 or not (as specified on the tech web access tab) and whether or not a 
 registry entry (see below) has been implemented in sys-start-scrtepmwo:</p>
<p style="margin-left: 66.25pt;"><font style="font-weight: bold;">Setting 
 Key:</font> TechServiceParts <font style="font-weight: bold;">Setting 
 Value:</font> No or Sub or Yes</p>
<p style="margin-left: 66.25pt;">If this registry option is set to No, 
 AND the Technician is not a Sub, flagged Service Parts will not be used 
 to create quoted lines on the PM Work Order.</p>
<p style="margin-left: 66.25pt;">If this registry option is set to Sub, 
 AND the Technician is not a Sub, handle flagged Service Parts using the 
 subcontractor processing (that writes these parts to the Work Requested). 
 If this registry option is set to Yes or is not present, use the default 
 processing that flagged Service Parts are used to create quoted lines 
 on the PM Work Order.</p>
<p style="margin-left: 88px;"> <font style="font-weight: bold;">Setting 
 Key:</font> DisableReqPMParts  <font style="font-weight: bold;">Setting 
 Value:</font> true (default is false)</p>
<p style="margin-left: 66.25pt;">This registry entry only controls the 
 writing of flagged service parts to the Required Resources tab for non-subcontractor 
 technicians if Required Resources are enabled for Work Orders in the sys-ffv-global-settings 
 registry. Required Resources are never written to the Required Resources 
 tab for subcontractor technicians.</p>
<p><img src="assets/images/image/Magnify.gif" alt="image\Magnify.gif" title="image\Magnify.gif" width="18" height="18" border="0"/> <font style="font-weight: bold;">Click</font> 
 <font style="font-weight: bold;">Magnify button to access</font></p>
<p><font style="font-weight: bold;">Cycle Code Filter:</font></p>
<p>This filter is used by Sam Pro and TechAnywhere to filter PM Work Order 
 Log Form Metrics lists for this piece of Equipment. Multiple cycle codes 
 may be entered as a comma-delimited list. Note that Log Form field in 
 the Client Site Equipment record determines which list of metrics is used.</p>
<p>If this field is blank, the system will use the Cycle Code in the Work 
 Code instead. Only those metrics whose CC: field corresponds to the filter 
 or is blank will be written to the Work Order (for Techs without remote 
 access) or uploaded to the Technician’s device. If the Cycle Code filter 
 in both the Schedule and Work Code are blank, all metrics from the Log 
 form will be written to the Metrics tab.</p>
<p>If one or more Cycle Codes are listed, only those metrics whose CC: 
 field corresponds to this field or is blank will be written to the Work 
 Order (for Techs without remote access) or uploaded to the Technician’s 
 device.</p>
<p><font style="font-weight: bold;">Accrued<br/>
</font>If this field is flagged, when PM Work Orders are generated, PM 
 Work Order will include two lines on the Revenue Adjustments tab.  One 
 is for recognizing the PM Income.  The line designated as &#39;ApplyPrepaid&#39; 
 relieves the accrued liability.  This will result in a zero-dollar 
 invoice that does the GL transfer. If this line was generated from Master 
 Contract, the Accrued box will be checked if the Master Contract Time 
 of Service Earn? Field was checked.</p>
<p style="margin-left: 36.00pt;"><font style="font-weight: bold;">Important:</font> 
 *ACCRUAL* is used as a special marker when PM Work Orders are generated; 
 these lines no longer post directly to JCH.  When the PM Invoice 
 is printed and posted, the appropriate GL and Job Cost entries will be 
 made to recognize the earned revenue values.</p>
