<h1>TechFinder Viewer</h1>
<h2>Purpose:</h2>
<p>The TechFinder Viewer is launched from the New Call screen to enable 
 the dispatcher to assign the call to the optimal technician and best date. 
 TechFinder may also be launched from the Work Order&#39;s Technician tab and 
 the Dispatch Board. </p>
<h2>Usage:</h2>
<p>TechFinder is designed to work with Service Zones; a Technician <span style="font-weight: bold;">must</span> be assigned to the work order 
 site&#39;s service zone (or one with a proximity relationship to the service 
 zone) in order to appear on the Tech Finder list.</p>
<p>This feature also works in conjunction the Certifications specified 
 on the Equipment Main tab, Equipment Certification Tab, and the Site Certification 
 Tab. Work Codes may also include Certifications if the <a href="Registry_Entry_Global_Settings__Column_Compression__Dispatch_Board_Rows__History_Log_Inventory_Markup.htm#Work_Code_Certifications_for_Techfinder">Registry 
 to add Work Code Certifications to TechFinder</a> is enabled. The use 
 of Certifications is highly recommended but is not required.</p>
<p style="margin-left: 48px;">When TechFinder is launched from New Call, 
 all Certifications for the selected Site and Equipment will also be listed. 
 This list is prepended with an ampersand &amp; so that only those Techs 
 with all the Certifications listed appear in TechFinder. If a Certification 
 is not specified, all Technicians will be listed, subject to the Zone 
 constraints.</p>
<p style="margin-left: 48px;"><span>When TechFinder is launched from the 
 Dispatch Board or Work Order Tech tab, all Certifications from the first 
 piece of Equipment will be listed will be listed. This list is prepended 
 with an ampersand &amp; so that only those Techs with all the Certifications 
 listed appear in TechFinder. If a Certification is not specified, all 
 Technicians will be listed, subject to the Zone constraints.</span></p>
<p style="margin-left: 8px;"><font style="font-weight: bold;">Important 
 Note: Technician Certifications<br/>
</font>In the Technician viewer, the system will allow (default) a blank 
 expiration date.  However, if using Certification filtering 
 in Tech Finder, Technicians with a blank Certification date are considered 
 expired and will not be displayed in Tech Finder.</p>
<p>See <a href="TechFinder_Viewer.htm#TechFinder_How_To_Use">How_To_Use 
 the Techfinder</a> for a step-by-step description on using this feature.</p>
<h2>Registry:</h2>
<p>A registry entry, sys-tech-finder, is used to configure the TechFinder 
 screen for your firm. Click <a href="Registry_Entry_for_TechFinder_Configuration.htm">Registry 
 Entry for TechFinder Configuration</a> for details.</p>
<p><a href="Registry_Entry_Global_Settings__Column_Compression__Dispatch_Board_Rows__History_Log_Inventory_Markup.htm#Work_Code_Certifications_for_Techfinder">Registry 
 to add Work Code Certifications to TechFinder</a></p>
<h3>Identify Unavailable Techs</h3>
<p>The word ‘OFF’ will appear on the Technician hours pane if the technician 
 is Unavailable. A Warning will appear saying the Tech is Unavailable if 
 you select an Unavailable date. Techs are flagged as Unavailable in the 
 Technician record’s Unavailable tab. To implement this functionality, 
 the sys-viewer-vdsptchbrd the registry option IdentifyUnavailableTechs 
 must be set to true.</p>
<h2>Important Fields: Technician List (Upper left-hand Pane)</h2>
<p class="Tip_Note_Heading" style="margin-top: 4.00pt;">Technician Id:<br/>
Technician Primary Phone Technician Call Phone Technician Pager<br/>
These fields default from the Technician record.</p>
<p>This pane displays the technicians eligible to work on the Equipment 
 specified in the work order. To be eligible Technicians must:</p>
<p style="margin-left: 48px;"><span>Have ALL the active Certifications 
 that match those in the Equipment&#39;s Main or Certifications Tab, AND the 
 Site&#39;s Certifications Tab.</span></p>
<p>If a Certification is not specified, all Technicians will be listed, 
 subject to the Zone constraints.</p>
<p>Be assigned to the Service Zone specified in the Site record, or a Service 
 Zone in proximity to the Site.</p>
<h3>Viewing Additional Tech Information</h3>
<p class="Reference_Line" style="margin-left: 36.00pt; margin-bottom: 0.00pt;"><font style="font-weight: bold;">Right-click</font> the selected Tech to 
 display additional information for this Technician (as seen on the Other 
 tab of the Technician viewer: click the CLOSE button when you have viewed 
 this information.</p>
<p><font style="font-weight: bold;">Left double-click</font> the selected 
 Tech to display the full Technician Viewer.</p>
<h2>Important Fields: Scheduled Hours (Upper right-hand Pane)</h2>
<p>By default, this pane displays a grid showing the hours for which this 
 technician is currently scheduled. This grid is color coded as follows 
 by default – this may be overridden via registry <a href="Registry_Entry_for_TechFinder_Configuration.htm">Registry 
 TechFinder Configuration (sys-tech-finder)</a> :</p>
<p> Green: 2 hours or less currently scheduled</p>
<p> Yellow: 2.01 - 4 hours currently scheduled</p>
<p> Red: More than 4 hours currently scheduled</p>
<p> Gray: weekend day</p>
<p> White: selected for the new call</p>
<p style="margin-left: 36.00pt;"><font style="font-weight: bold;">Tech</font><font style="font-weight: bold;">nician OFF:</font> if this feature is implemented 
 <font style="font-weight: bold;">(</font>registry option IdentifyUnavailableTechs 
 in sys-viewer-vdsptchbrd is set to true and time off has been entered 
 on the Technician record’s Unavailable tab) the word ‘OFF’ will appear 
 on the Technician hours pane if the technician is Unavailable. A Warning 
 will appear saying the Tech is Unavailable if you select an Unavailable 
 date.</p>
<p>As discussed in the section entitled &#39;Selecting a Tech and Day&#39;, you 
 will simply click on the grid block for the Technician and Date to which 
 you wish to assign the new call.</p>
<p><font style="font-weight: bold;">Alternate WO Count/ Zone View</font></p>
<p>An alternate view is available via registry (see <a href="Registry_Entry_Global_Settings__Column_Compression__Dispatch_Board_Rows__History_Log_Inventory_Markup.htm#sys-ffv-global-settings_TechFinder">TechFinder 
 Alternate View - sys-ffv-global-settings registry option</a> ) that displays 
 the following:</p>
<p>W=n Z=n</p>
<p>where W means Work Order and n is the number of work orders for that 
 day and Z means Zone and n is the number of work orders scheduled that 
 day that match the search zone specified. The background colors of Green, 
 Yellow and Red are retained to indicate estimated hour load.</p>
<h2>Important Fields: Middle Pane</h2>
<p>The middle pane of the TechFinder lets you adjust the parameters used 
 to generate the list of eligible technicians and service dates.</p>
<h3>Search Focus:</h3>
<p><font style="font-weight: bold;">Service Zone:<br/>
</font>When the TechFinder is first opened, the Service Zone defaults to 
 the one specified in the Client Site record, and only those Techs attached 
 to this Zone (with an appropriate Certification) will be listed. You may 
 change the Service Id by entering a valid Id or double-clicking to select 
 from a list.</p>
<p><font style="font-weight: bold;">Proximity:<br/>
</font>The Proximity field is initially blank; only Techs (with appropriate 
 Certification) attached to the specified Zone will be listed. To increase 
 the list of eligible Techs, enter a number in this field. All Techs attached 
 to Zones with proximity with this Proximity rating or less will be listed.</p>
<p><font style="font-weight: bold;">Example:<br/>
</font>Supposed Cleve-DT (Cleveland Downtown) is selected. The following 
 Zone are related to Cleve-DT with these proximity values:</p>
<p>Cleve-West 1<br/>
Cleve-East 1<br/>
Cleve-South 2<br/>
Euclid  3</p>
<p>If you entered a 2 in the Proximity field, Techs assigned to Cleve-West, 
 Cleve-East and Cleve-South would be listed, but Techs assigned only to 
 Euclid would not be.</p>
<p><font style="font-weight: bold;">Technician Id: Date Scheduled:<br/>
</font>These display-only fields display the Technician and Date you selected 
 for the new call by clicking a block in the upper right-hand panel.</p>
<p><font style="font-weight: bold;">Start Date:<br/>
</font>This field determines the starting date of the grid in the upper 
 right-hand pane. It defaults from the Date Scheduled in the New Call viewer; 
 today&#39;s date will default if the Date Scheduled was blank when the TechFinder 
 button was clicked. This date may be changed by the user; when you tab 
 out of this field, the grid will be updated to reflect the new Start Date.</p>
<p><font style="font-weight: bold;">Original Technician</font>:<br/>
This field displays the technician to whom the work order was originally 
 assigned. If the work order was not a assigned to any technician, ‘unassigned’ 
 will appear.</p>
<p><font style="font-weight: bold;">Days:</font><br/>
The number of days of the grid in the upper right-hand pane. This field 
 defaults from the sys-tech-finder registry setting, but may be adjusted 
 by the user. When you tab out of this field, the number of days in the 
 grid will reflect the new value.</p>
<p><font style="font-weight: bold;">Restrict to Techs Already Scheduled 
 to Work in Zone(s)?<br/>
</font>If you check this box (by double-clicking on the field or pressing 
 Spacebar), the Technician list will be restricted to those already scheduled 
 to work at Sites in the selected Service Zone or Zones.</p>
<p><font style="font-weight: bold;">Show Additional Techs Already Scheduled 
 to Work in Zone(s)?<br/>
</font>This box should be checked (by double-clicking on it or pressing 
 the Spacebar) if you wish the grid to include all technicians that service 
 the selected zones as well as any additional techs that have one or more 
 calls scheduled within the selected zones, regardless of where or not 
 the certification criteria matches.</p>
<p><font style="font-weight: bold;">Service Zone Id Range:<br/>
</font>This range is automatically updated when you change the Search Focus 
 Service Zone and Proximity fields. It may be manually set by the user 
 to specify which Service Zones should be queried for eligible Technicians.</p>
<p style="margin-left: 48px;">Example:</p>
<p style="margin-left: 48px;">To search for Technicians in Zones A1 through 
 A5:   A1_A5</p>
<p style="margin-left: 48px;">To search for Technicians in all Zones beginning 
 with A:  A%</p>
<p style="margin-left: 48px;">To search for Technicians in Zones A1, B2, 
 C5:   A1,B2,C5</p>
<p style="font-weight: bold;">Certification Range:<br/>
<span style="font-weight: normal;">This range defaults from the Certifications 
 found in the Equipment&#39;s Main and Certifications tab, and the Sites&#39;s 
 Certifications Tab.  It will be prepended with an ampersand (&amp;) 
 so that only the active Technicians who have EVERY certification listed 
 (subject to additional filter criteria will appear.</span><span> </span> </p>
<p style="font-weight: bold;"><span style="font-weight: normal;">It may 
 be manually set by the user to specify different or additional Certifications.</span></p>
<p style="font-weight: bold;"><span style="font-weight: normal;">If you 
 precede the list of Certification Categories with an ampersand (&amp;), 
 Techfinder will ONLY display the active Technicians who have EVERY certification 
 listed (subject to additional filter criteria).</span> <span style="font-weight: bold;"> </span></p>
<p style="margin-left: 48px; font-weight: normal; text-decoration: underline; ">Examples:</p>
<p style="margin-left: 48px; font-weight: normal;">&amp;CERT1,CERT2,CERT3<br/>
This returns only active Technicians that have all three Certifications 
 listed in their Technician record.</p>
<p style="margin-left: 48px; font-weight: bold;"><span style="font-weight: normal;">CERT1,CERT2,CERT3<br/>
This returns all active Technicians that have any or all of the three Certifications 
 listed in their Technician record.</span></p>
