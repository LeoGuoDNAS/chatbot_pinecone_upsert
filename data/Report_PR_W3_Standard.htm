<h1>Report PR W3 Standard</h1>
<h2>Purpose:</h2>
<p>This function is used to print W3 Forms. W3 forms may be printed separately 
 via Report PR W3s (Standard) from the report menu or, optionally, directly 
 after Copy A of the W2. Note that this report does not require native 
 PCL printing.</p>
<h2>Usage:</h2>
<p>Successful W2 reporting depends on properly formatted registry entries 
 and tax-related records. Click <a href="W2_Records_and_Setup.htm">W2 Records 
 and Setup</a> to review your records as discussed before running your 
 W2&#39;s.</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: bold;">Company Record: </span>In Version 9.1.611.045 
 and Above, if Intercompany processing is enabled then the following 
 the Employer Info will now come from the appropriate Company records, 
 NOT the registries: Company Name, Company Address and Company Federal 
 EIN.</p>
<h2>Registry Entries:</h2>
<p>Make any adjustments needed to the horizontal or vertical positions 
 via the <a href="Registry_W2_Entry.htm">sys-printer-W2</a> and/or <a href="Registry_W3_Printing.htm">sys-printer-W3</a> 
 registries and check for alignment as needed.</p>
<p><a href="Registry_Entry_W2_and_W3_Printing.htm">Registry W2 Printing 
 (sys-report-rw2)</a> . This registry also supports the additional fields 
 required for W3 printing.</p>
<p>The <a href="Registry_Entry_Federal_EIN.htm">Registry Entry Federal 
 and State EIN</a> and <a href="Registry_Company_Name_Entry.htm">Registry 
 Company Name Entry</a> must be also be set correctly.</p>
<h2>Printing Notes:</h2>
<p><b style="mso-bidi-font-weight: normal;">Unless your support representative 
 updated your Folders view or made the appropriate Function Substitution, 
 you will need to run the new report from the Report Menu.</b><span style="mso-spacerun: yes;"> </span> Run 
 Report PR W-2 (Standard) and print a test alignment of your tax forms 
 for one or two employees before running all copies. You will be prompted 
 to run the Report PR W-3 (Standard) (although Report PR W-3s (Std) may 
 be also be run stand-alone).</p>
<p>W2&#39;s are printed in 1-part laser format. The 2 forms per page formats 
 are recommended. You will perform several print runs to produce your W2&#39;s 
 for the federal, state and local governments, your own records, and for 
 your employees. You must remember to change your forms as needed between 
 runs so that you do not waste forms.</p>
<p style="margin-left: 36.00pt;"><font style="font-weight: bold;">TIP: 
 Aligning your Forms:</font> we suggest printing a W2 for two employees 
 (by entering their  Id&#39;s in the Employee range) to check alignment. 
 DO NOT use the Plain Paper copy option. Make any adjustments needed to 
 the horizontal or vertical positions via the <a href="Registry_W2_Entry.htm">sys-printer-W2</a> 
 and/or sys-printer-W3 registries.</p>
<p style="margin-left: 8px;"><font style="font-weight: bold;">W3 Support</font><br/>
The Copy A option of Report PR W-2s (Standard) allows the printing of a 
 W3 form at the end of the report. The system will print the Copy A’s and 
 summary page as usual, and then pause. The following message box will 
 appear:</p>
<p style="margin-left: 88px;"> Print W3 Form? Insert W3 Form Now.</p>
<p style="margin-left: 8px;">If you want to print the W3, DO <font style="font-weight: bold;">NOT</font> 
 RESPOND TO THIS MESSAGE IMMEDIATELY. To print the W3 form, the user should 
 verify that all Copy A’s plus the summary page have been printed, and 
 then load the W3 form in the printer.</p>
<p style="margin-left: 8px;"><font style="font-weight: bold;">After</font> 
 the W3 form has been loaded, the user should then click Yes in the message 
 box to print the W3 form. Note that if taxes for more than one state have 
 been assessed, an X will be printed in the State portion of Box 15, and 
 the Employer’s state ID number will be blank.</p>
<h2>Important Fields:</h2>

Enter the year the W-3 is being produced for (e.g., 2017). This field must 
 be completed in order for your W-3 to print.</p>

</font>The system sets the Start Date and the End Date based on the Year 
 field. These dates may not be edited by the user.</p>
