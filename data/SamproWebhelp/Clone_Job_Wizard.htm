  <h1>Clone Job Wizard Button</h1>
  <h2>Purpose:</h2>
  <p>Create and edit job-related records. When records are cloned via the Job&#39;s Clone Job button, a record change log entry noting the source record reference info is written to each new record.  </p>
  <h2>Usage:</h2>
  <p>The Job viewer&#39;s Clone function verifies that the user has Add privileges or they can&#39;t create Client / Site records. A registry option may be used to further restrict the ability to add Clients / Sites via the clone.</p>
  <p>When cloning the Job, Client and Site records, the default Date Opened is set to the current date.</p>
  <p>The Client Site Equipment’s Master Contract Id is not copied to cloned equipment records.</p>
  <p style="font-weight: bold;"><span style="font-weight: normal;">Job Billing Items and Job Cost Codes flagged as &#39;Obsolete&#39; will </span>not<span style="font-weight: normal;"> be cloned if the Job is not flagged as a Template. Obsolete Billing Items and Cost Codes from Template Jobs will be cloned to support scenarios where users may wish to open up Billing Items and Cost Codes as a complex job progresses.  Change Orders and Change Order Requests are also not cloned.</span></p>
  <p style="font-weight:">The previous release allowed cloned Jobs with required fields to save without completing the required fields. When a user did not provide any additional information and close without saving, there was no alert to complete the required fields.</p>
  <p>
    <font style="font-weight: bold;">Job Cloning</font>
    <font style="font-weight: bold;">with Security:</font><br/>
    When the &quot;SecurityOverrideFrom=job&quot; is present in sys-ffv-global-settings, the cloning process retains the security values from the source records.  For example, the security of the new job should be set from the template job&#39;s security.  This includes other job-based data such as the cost codes, billing items and any job child records.  In a similar way the source client site&#39;s security is used in the new site record(s) and the source client&#39;s security is used in the client record(s).
  </p>
  <p><span>In 9.1.611.062 and up, <span>if the target Client or Client Site is inactive, </span>a warning message when cloning Jobs displays if the status is NOT active.</span></p>
  <h2>Registry Entries:</h2>
  <p><a href="Registry_Entry_Job_and_Job_Cloning.htm">Registry Entry Job and Job Cloning</a>.- this registry has an option to allow the cloned Job&#39;s Branch to be set from the Site, not the Job template.</p>
  <h2>Instructions:</h2>
  <p>
    <font style="font-weight: bold;">A.</font> Choose the appropriate template job, or locate a Job that is similar to the one you wish to clone. If you have selected a template job, note that the Add, Save and Delete buttons will be disabled because you cannot edit a Template Job in the Job viewer (although you can clone from it).
  </p>
  <p style="margin-left: 36.00pt;">Examples: If you want to add a new job, client site, job cost code(s), and billing item(s) to an existing Client, you could pick an existing job for that Client that was similar in structure to the one you want to create to clone from. Alternately, if you wanted to add a Construction Job to an existing Site, you might pick a construction job template.</p>
  <p><img alt="image\clonejob.gif" border="0" height="28" src="assets/images/image/clonejob.gif" title="image\clonejob.gif" width="48"/>
    <font style="font-weight: bold;">B.</font> Click the Clone Job button. You will be warned if the job that you selected is not a template.
  </p>
  <p>A box will appear prompting you to enter the following information.</p>
  <p style="margin-left: 48px;">
    <font style="font-weight: bold;">Job Id  Job Name</font><br/>
    If automatic Job Id sequencing is turned on in your system and you wish the system to generate the next Job Id for you, leave the Job Id blank and just complete the Name. If automatic Job Id sequencing is not implemented in your system, enter a unique Job Id and complete the Name field as well.
  </p>
  <p style="margin-left: 48px;">If you are auto-sequencing using a &#39;mask&#39; and it is specified in the Job Template, the system will use it to generate the Job Id. However, if the Job / Job Template DOES NOT have a mask in the specified field, the user should manually set the Job Id.</p>
  <p style="margin-left: 48px;">If an existing Job Id is entered in the Job Clone Wizard, the message “New Job Id already exists, this job cannot be used” will be displayed, and the existing job will not be overwritten.</p>
  <p style="margin-left: 48px;">
    <font style="font-weight: bold;">Client Site Id  Client Site Name</font><br/>
    Enter a new Client Site Id and Name if you want to create a new Site to go with this Job. <font style="font-weight: bold;">Note:</font> if the Client Site you are cloning from has any Equipment attached to it, the Equipment Records will also be cloned. If you are cloning from a template job, both of these fields will be blank and must be completed.
  </p>
  <p style="margin-left: 48px;">If you are cloning the Job for the (non-template) Site listed, leave this field as it was.</p>
  <p style="margin-left: 48px;">If you are cloning the Job for a different Site that has already been created, select the Client Site Id by double-clicking on this field.</p>
  <p style="margin-left: 48px;">
    <font style="font-weight: bold;">Client Id  Client Name</font><br/>
    Enter a new Client Id only if you also want to create a new Client for your new Site and Job. If you are cloning from a template job, both of these fields will be blank and must be completed. Otherwise, retain the value the system entered for you.
  </p>
  <p class="Body_Text_Indent" style="margin-left: 5.75pt;">Click the OK button when all the information is entered correctly. Your newly cloned job now appears in the Job record viewer.</p>
  <p class="Body_Text_Indent" style="margin-left: 5.75pt;"><span style="font-weight: bold;">C.</span> Upon completion of the Job Cloning process, SAMPro will open the newly created Site / Client record(s). This provides a friendly reminder to the user to finish meaning enter additional relevant information (addresses, contacts, etc) that can&#39;t be entered during the cloning process. The Site / Client viewers will only be opened if a new record was created.  For example, if the user cloned for an existing Client, the Client viewer would not be opened.</p>
  <p class="Body_Text">
    <font style="font-weight: bold;">D.</font> Edit the other Records related to this Job by using the Edit buttons on the side button bar.
