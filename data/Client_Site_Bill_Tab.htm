<h1>Client Site PM Billings Tab</h1>
<p class="Body_Text">This tab enables you to create/maintain a billing 
 schedule; PM invoices for this Client Site will be based on this schedule. 
 The billing schedule may be entered manually or generated from Master 
 Contract.</p>
<p>This tab also support the Rental Billing of Assets.</p>
<p class="Body_Text">Most users employ the &#39;PM Invoice&#39; work order functionality 
 for purpose of billing PM’s in advance thru the Service Invoice module. 
 This enables &quot;service&quot; jobs to be used on the Client Site Billing 
 Schedule.  When Create PM Billings is run for Jobs that are 
 flagged as Service Compute, and the <a href="Registry_Create_PM_Billing_Work_Order_Invoice.htm">Registry 
 Create PM Billing Work Order Invoice</a> entry has been made, the system 
 will generate a PM Invoice Work Order. This Work Order will be set to 
 Invoice Ready, with an invoice amount on the Other tab corresponding to 
 the Bill Amount on this line. Once this Work Order has been generated, 
 it will be billed and posted via the Start Compute Service Invoice function.</p>
<h2>Usage:</h2>
<p>The PM Billing Schedule should now be used as the one-and-only source 
 for PM Billing information.  Although Master Contract entries 
 continue to generated to this tab, contract changes, credit memos, revised 
 billing, etc should be managed from this tab. The ability to enter both 
 positive and negative contract amounts provides the user with means to 
 do so.</p>
<h3>Common Lines Invoice (taxable and non-taxable components)</h3>
<p>This enhancement allows &#39;common&#39; lines to be included on a single PM 
 Invoice so that taxable and non-taxable components can be handled appropriately. 
 Lines are considered &#39;common&#39; when <span id="BugEvents281">they have the 
 same values for these fields:</span></p>
<p style="margin-left: 48px;"><span>Client Site Id, Billing Schedule Date, 
 Job Id, Cost Code, Billing Item, Payment Alias</span></p>
<p style="margin-left: 8px;">This allows common PM Billing lines with different 
 Job Cost Categories to appear on the same PM Work Order Invoice with both 
 taxable and non-taxable components. The Job Cost Category is accessed 
 via the Magnify button.</p>
<h3>Site and Job Validations:</h3>
<p>If the Site is not Active, a PM Billing entry will not be created. In 
 addition, if the Job’s (in the PM Billing schedule) has a Job Date Closed 
 that precedes the Billing Date, a PM Invoice will not be created.</p>
<h3>Validation Rules for Line Changes</h3>
<p>The system looks at whether a line has been invoiced or had PM Earnings 
 posted when determining what changes the user is allowed to make to the 
 line:</p>
<p style="margin-left: 36.00pt;">a. If the line has been invoiced or have 
 earnings posted, the Bill Date may NOT be changed. The OK to Renew field 
 may be changed by the user regardless of the status of either of these 
 fields.</p>
<p style="margin-left: 36.00pt;">b. If the line has been invoiced but not 
 had earnings posted, changes are only allowed to the Amount Earned, GL 
 Debit account, and OK to Renew fields.</p>
<p style="margin-left: 36.00pt;">c. If the line has had earnings posted 
 but has not been invoiced, changes are only allowed to the Amount Billed, 
 GL Credit account, and the OK to Renew fields.</p>
<p style="margin-left: 36.00pt;"><font style="font-weight: bold;">Important: 
 If the</font> <font style="font-weight: bold;">Client is No Longer a PM 
 Customer</font><font style="font-weight: bold;"><br/>
</font>Click <a href="Client_Site_PM_Billing_Tips.htm">Client Site PM Billing 
 Tips</a> for details on how to handle existing billings and prevent future 
 ones.</p>
<h2>Important Fields:</h2>
<p><font style="font-weight: bold;">Renewable Billings: Renewable Earnings:<br/>
</font>These display-only field show the running total of the Amount to 
 Invoice and Amount Earned of all lines marked as &#39;Ok to Renew&#39;.</p>
<p><font style="font-weight: bold;">Date:</font> <br/>
Enter the billing date for this item directly or double-click on this field 
 (or press Alt-F7) to access the Calendar viewer to do so. To enter today&#39;s 
 date, simply press Spacebar.</p>
<p><font style="font-weight: bold;">Amt to Bill: Amt to Earn:<br/>
</font>The Amount to Bill field indicates the billing amount for this time 
 period. The Amount to Earn would be completed if you are amortizing the 
 Amount to Bill on this (or a previous) line.</p>
<p>These fields both allow entry of negative values to allow the effective 
 reverse of errors/changes in billing and amortization by adding a new 
 line (with the appropriate negative values). After running Compute PM 
 billing, the user should then print the negative dollar invoice (it will 
 use the Client Site PM Billing line as the ‘source journal’). Note that 
 validation prevents the entry of both positive and negative contract amounts 
 on the same line. The entry of negative amounts is denied on lines flagged 
 as &#39;renewable&#39;.</p>
<p>When the Start PM Billing function is run, negative Amt to Earn (amortization) 
 lines will result in a GL Journal entry with a negative debit to the accrued 
 expenses account (the GL Debit account) and a negative credit to the sales 
 accrued (the GL Credit account).</p>
<p style="margin-left: 36.00pt;"><font style="font-weight: bold;">Foreign 
 Currency Processing</font><font style="font-weight: bold;">:<br/>
</font>If this is a foreign customer, these fields must be entered in terms 
 of the foreign revenue the customer will be billed in.</p>
<p class="Tip_Note_Heading" style="margin-top: 4.00pt;">GL Acnt:  GL 
 Acnt:</p>
<p><font style="text-decoration: underline; ">If Amortizing the Amount 
 Earned on a Billing Schedule.</font></p>
<p style="margin-left: 36.00pt;">The first GL Account is the Income (sales 
 or revenue) account where the Amount Earned will post. This Account will 
 be credited with the Amount Earned when the Start Create PM Invoice function 
 is run.</p>
<p style="margin-left: 36.00pt;">The second GL Account is the Liability 
 (unearned income) account where the Amount Billed will post. This Account 
 will be credited with the Amount Billed when PM invoices are generated, 
 printed, and posted.</p>
<p style="margin-left: 36.00pt;">Note, both accounts are required on each 
 line (unless the applicable registry entries have been made in sys-ffv-global-setting 
 to provide the defaults). Amortized amounts will post with the ending 
 date of the corresponding accounting period.</p>
<p style="margin-left: 36.00pt;">The GL Journal entries generated by this 
 function will have a header Transaction Description of &quot;pm accrual 
 entries&quot;. The detail transaction description will be of the form 
 &quot;client site id:&quot; followed by the actual client site id.</p>
<p><font style="text-decoration: underline; ">If Not Amortizing the Amount 
 Earned on a billing schedule.</font></p>
<p style="margin-left: 36.00pt;">The first GL Account is the Income (sales 
 or revenue) account where the Amount Billed will post. This Account will 
 be credited with the Amount Billed when PM invoices are generated, printed, 
 and posted. The second GL Account field should not be completed.</p>
<p><font style="font-weight: bold;">Job Id: Cost Code: Billing Item:</font><br/>
These fields are required for PM Billing and for Amortization entries.</p>
<p><font style="font-weight: bold;">Ok to Renew:</font><br/>
Any line(s) flagged as OK to Renew will be copied when the Renew Service 
 Contracts function is run. During the Renew Service Contract processing, 
 the new line will then be flagged as Ok to Renew; the older line that 
 was used as a template will have the Ok to Renew field blanked.</p>
<p><font style="font-weight: bold;">Invoice Description:</font> (40 character)<br/>
This optional field enables you to enter a brief description of this billing 
 to appear on the invoice; it will be written to the Revenue Adjustment 
 tab of PM Invoice type work order. The extended Invoice Description (accessed 
 by clicking the Magnify button) allows for a more detailed description.</p>
<p><font style="font-weight: bold;">PM Inv No:</font><br/>
This display-only field will be filled in by the system when a line has 
 been Invoiced by running the <a href="Create_PM_Invoice.htm">Generate 
 PM Invoice</a> function on the Folders Invoicing tab (When this function 
 is run, the Computed Thru date in the PM Job record specified in the Client 
 Site will also be set to the Bill Date specified to ensure that future 
 billings for this Job are computed correctly.). Lines that have been invoiced 
 cannot be deleted.</p>
<p><font style="font-weight: bold;">Invoice Status<br/>
</font>This field comes from the Invoice Master record (if available):</p>
<p style="margin-left: 36.00pt;">When the PM Invoice No. field is blank, 
 the Invoice Status is blank.<br/>
When a valid PM Invoice Id is shown, the Invoice Status comes from the 
 associated Invoice Master record.<br/>
If the PM Invoice Id cannot be found in the Invoice Master table, the Invoice 
 Status displays &#39;unknown&#39;.</p>
<p><font style="font-weight: bold;">GLJ Trx Id:</font> <font style="font-weight: bold;"><br/>
</font>This display-only field lists the GL Transaction Id of amortized 
 lines that have been posted to GL.</p>
<p style="margin-left: 36.00pt;">If the line&#39;s amortization amount (Amt 
 to Earn) is zero, the GLJ Trx Id displays &#39;n/a&#39;.</p>
<p style="margin-left: 36.00pt;">When the line has an Earn amount but the 
 posted-to-gl flag is false, the Trx Id display is blank.</p>
<p style="margin-left: 36.00pt;">If the system fails to find a qualifying 
 transaction, the Trx Id display reads &#39;unknown&#39;.</p>
<p style="margin-left: 36.00pt;">If multiple amortizations for the same 
 accounting period have been made for the same job, only the most recent 
 GLJ Transaction will be listed. If this is the case, the GLJ Transaction 
 will be followed by an asterisk, indicated that multiple transactions 
 exist.</p>
<p><font style="font-weight: bold;">Posted to GL?<br/>
</font>This display-only field will be filled in by the system when a PM 
 Accrual entry has been made. Posted lines may not be deleted.</p>
<p><img src="assets/images/image/Magnify.gif" alt="" style="border: none;" border="0"/> 
 Click the Magnify Button to Access the following fields.</p>
<p><font style="font-weight: bold;">Invoice Description Extended<br/>
</font>This field allows for a more detailed Invoice Description.  If 
 completed, this field is written to the Invoice Description of Work Performed 
 during the creation of PM Invoice-type work orders. Note that the older 
 Invoice Description on the PM line is still written to the Revenue Adjustment 
 line as in previous releases.</p>
<p>This field was expanded from 400 to 3000 characters in Version 8.1 to 
 match the WO&#39;s Work Performed field.  When creating new Billing 
 Schedule lines from Master Contracts, the system now sets the line&#39;s Extended 
 Description to the associated Billing Item&#39;s Invoice Description.</p>
<p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"> </p>
<p><font style="font-weight: bold;">Work Order Id:<br/>
</font>If a PM Invoice Work Order was generated to bill this line, its 
 Id will be displayed in this field.</p>
<p><font style="font-weight: bold;">GL Income:<br/>
GL Accrual:</font></p>
<p>These fields correspond to the first and second GL Accounts discussed 
 above.</p>
<p style="margin-left: 36.00pt;"><font style="font-weight: bold; font-style: italic;" color="#FF0000">PM Master Contract</font><br/>
The <a href="PM_Master_Schedule_Master_Contract_.htm">PM Master Schedule 
 (Master Contract)</a> function may be used to maintain both Billing and 
 Scheduling records for your service agreements.</p>
<p style="margin-left: 36.00pt;"><font style="font-weight: bold;">Things 
 to Check if a PM Accrual Did Not Post</font></p>
<p style="margin-left: 36.00pt;">- The Client Site is not Active; accruals 
 will not be posted for Credit Hold Sites.</p>
<p style="margin-left: 36.00pt;">- The Job Date closed is less than the 
 Effective Date on the accrual line.</p>
<p style="margin-left: 36.00pt;">- Both GL Accounts are completed. If you 
 are using Master Contracts, the GL Accounts for revenues and accruals 
 must be filled in on the detail view, on the Adv Bill tab in Master 
 Contract for each of the lines created.   Or the registry 
 entry must be in place to default in the accounts on the line from sys-viewer-vmstrcntrct.</p>
<p style="margin-left: 36.00pt;">- The Closing Date of the Accounting Period 
 of the Accrual must be between the Begin and End date of the Job.</p>
<p style="margin-left: 36.00pt;">- The invoice that was billed out and 
 is being accrued may not have been posted.</p>
<p style="margin-left: 8px; font-weight: bold;">Job Cost Category Id:<br/>
<span style="font-weight: normal;">In some States certain Preventive Maintenances 
 are taxable while others are not taxable. If completed, this field 
 overrides the default Cost Category derived from the  sys-start-scrtepmbllng 
 registry&#39;s Cost Category option can be overridden with the value on the 
 Site Billing Schedule line.   This will allow the user 
 full control to make the Billing taxable or non-taxable as needed.</span></p>
<p style="margin-left: 8px;"><span id="BugEvents29">This field also enables 
 a single PM Invoice to be generated with taxable and non-taxable components. 
 To do so, create 2 lines with the following fields entered identically, 
 but with</span> <span style="font-weight: bold;">different</span> <span>Job 
 Cost Categories to define the taxable and non-taxable elements:</span>
