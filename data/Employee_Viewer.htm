<p><font style="font-weight: bold;">Annual Hours</font><font style="font-weight: bold;">:</font><font style="font-weight: bold;"><br/>
</font>This field allows the Annual Standard Hours used in various payroll

 Registry Entry for Standard Hours</a> or by 2080 if this registry does 
 not exist). This allows the user to control the Standard Annual Hours 
 so that the effective pay rate written to job history will use the ‘correct’ 
 rate (Salary / Standard Hours) without having to run Compute Payroll to 
 have the pay rate updated to the correct effective rate (= Salary / Pay 
 Periods / Hours Entered).</p>
<p><font style="font-weight: bold;">Executive P/R?<br/>
</font>If this field is checked, it indicates that this individual receives 
 executive payroll that should be kept confidential. A corresponding field 
 also exists in the User and Employee.  By definition:</p>
<p style="margin-left: 23.75pt;">- An Executive P/R Employee is only accessible 
 by an Executive P/R User.</p>
<p style="margin-left: 23.75pt;">- The Executive Payroll check box in an 
 Employee record may only be set or cleared by a user with the Executive 
 Payroll box checked in their user record</p>
<p style="margin-left: 23.75pt;">- An Executive P/R User has full access 
 to ALL employees. <span>Users (with access to Employee records) must have 
 Executive P/R flagged in their User record in order to access Employee 
 records flagged as Executive Payroll.</span></p>
<p class="Reference_Line" style="margin-bottom: 0.00pt;">Executive Payroll 
 enter/edit restrictions have been applied so that users without the Executive 
 Payroll flag will not be able to access entries for Executive Payroll 
 Employees in the Labor Journal, PR Journal and Job Journal as well as 
 many reports. See <a href="Executive_Payroll.htm">Executive Payroll</a> 
 for details.</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: bold;">Target Ratio</span><br/>
This field is used in conjunction with the Employee Utilization Report. 
 It indicates the target percentage of billable hours for this employee 
 (% of hours worked on direct jobs). This field will appear on the Employee 
 Utilization Report along with the calculated percent of time worked on 
 direct jobs to provide a comparison of how close an employee is to his 
 or her target value.</p>
<p><font style="font-weight: bold;">Office Field</font><br/>
If this employee always (or almost always) works in the office, select 
 the Office option (by double-clicking on its radio button.) If the employee 
 usually travels to a job site to work, select Field.</p>
<p>The system uses these fields to default the Payroll Tax Authorities 
 in Payroll Adjustment and Labor journal entries. If the employee is marked 
 as an office employee, the system looks at the State and Local Tax Authorities 
 in the Employee record to determine the physical location of the employee 
 when he was working on a job. If the employee is marked as a field employee, 
 the system looks at the State and Local Tax Authorities in the Job record 
 to determine the physical location of the employee when he was working 
 on a job.</p>
<p style="margin-left: 48px;"><span style="font-weight: bold;">Additional 
 Other Taxes:</span><span> If additional Other taxes are levied at a job 
 site, a registry-enabled enhancement may be used to designate a Job User 
 field to serve as container for holding additional Tax Authorities to 
 be evaluated during Payroll Compute; see <a href="Registry_Entry_for_Taxable_Fringe_Benefits.htm#Additional_Other_Taxes">Additional 
 Other Taxes Registry</a> for details. </span></p>
<p><font style="font-weight: bold;">Driver&#39;s License:  Vehicle Number:<br/>
</font>These fields enable you to track license and vehicle information 
 for field service personnel.</p>
<p><font style="font-weight: bold;">GL Entity<br/>
</font> This field enables Payroll Tax Liabilities, Deductions, Worker&#39;s 
 Comp, and Earnings entries to be assigned to specific entities. If this 
 field is completed, it will be used in Compute Payroll as follows <span style="font-weight: bold;">unless overridden via</span><span> <a href="Registry_Entry_Global_Settings__Column_Compression__Dispatch_Board_Rows__History_Log_Inventory_Markup.htm#Use_Control_Records_GL_Entities_for_PR">Use

<p style="margin-left: 36.00pt;"><font style="font-weight: bold;">Payroll 
 Tax Liability: Credit Entry<br/>
</font>If a GL Entity Id has been entered in the Employee record, the credit 
 will be applied to this Entity.<br/>
If the GL Entity Id field is blank in the Employee record, the system will 
 credit the GL Entity in the Tax Authority record (if the GL Entity is 
 filled in).<br/>
If the GL Entity is blank in both the Employee and Payroll Tax Authority 
 records, a GL Entity will not be credited.</p>
<p style="margin-left: 36.00pt;"><font style="font-weight: bold;">Deductions: 
 Debit Entry<br/>
</font> If a GL Entity Id has been entered in the Employee record, the 
 debit will be applied to this Entity.<br/>
If the GL Entity Id field is blank in the Employee record, the system will 
 debit the GL Entity in the Deduction (if the GL Entity is filled in).<br/>
If the GL Entity is blank in both the Employee and Deduction records, a 
 GL Entity will not be debited.</p>
<p style="margin-left: 36.00pt;"><font style="font-weight: bold;">Workers 
 Comp: Debit and Credit Entries</font><br/>
If a GL Entity Id has been entered in the Employee record, the debit and 
 credit entries will be applied to this Entity.<br/>
If the GL Entity Id field is blank in the Employee record, the system will 
 look to the Workers Comp record for the GL Entity.<br/>
If the GL Entity is blank in both the Employee and Workers Comp records, 
 a GL Entity will not be debited or credited.</p>
<p style="margin-left: 36.00pt;"><font style="font-weight: bold;">Earnings: 
 Fringe Credit Entry</font><br/>
If a GL Entity Id has been entered in the Employee record, the credit for 
 fringes will be applied to this Entity. If the GL Entity Id field is blank 
 in the Employee record, the system will credit the GL Entity in the Earnings 
 record (if the GL Entity is filled in).<br/>
If the GL Entity is blank in both the Employee and Earnings records, a 
 GL Entity will not be credited.</p>
<p style="margin-left: 48px; font-weight: bold;">The above functionality 
 will be trumped if the following registry is enabled to force the Credit 
 to follow the Debit:</p>

<p><font style="font-weight: bold;">Remote Time Sheet Group:<br/>
</font>This field enables filtering during the RCP Post for time entered 
 via the Remote Timesheet Applet. This allows you to post time for selected 
 groups. For example, if you have both hourly (that are paid every week) 
 and salary employees (that are paid on the last day of each month). If 
 you were to enter the Remote Time Group field of weekly employees as <font style="font-weight: bold;">w,</font> and the Remote Time Group field 
 of salary employees as <font style="font-weight: bold;">m,</font> you 
 could post time for hourly and salary employees separately by completing 
 the Remote Time Group field in the Start RCP Post function.</p>

<p style="font-weight: bold; margin-left: 48px;"><span style="font-weight: bold;">Remote 
 Timesheet (Dialect) Users:</span></p>
<p style="margin-left: 48px;">This field is used to control what Remote 
 Timesheet options and reports this employee can access. If this field 
 is completed, the system will check for a corresponding sys-remotetime-style 
 registry entry to use when the employee logs on to the remote time screen. 
 For example, if this employee is a project manager, and the Remote Time 
 Sheet Style is filled in with <font style="font-weight: bold;">pm</font>, 
 the system will look for the registry entry <font style="font-weight: bold;">sys-remotetime-pm</font> 
 to determine what options and reports this user should have.</p>
