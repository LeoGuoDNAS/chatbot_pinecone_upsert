<h1>Report Range Viewer</h1>
<h2>Purpose:</h2>
<p>This viewer lets you control the format, range of data, and the order 
 of your reports. This help topic discusses system and user-defined reports 
 in general.</p>
<p>Click <a href="Report_Options.htm">ReportAnywhere Options</a> for details 
 on ReportAnywhere scheduling options.</p>
<h2>Usage:</h2>
<p>Required to run reports manually. This viewer may also be used to schedule 
 a report to be run automatically (if this feature is implemented on your 
 system). When you click the Go button, the system may ask you to select 
 a printer. If you elected to Preview the Report, it will appear on your 
 screen. Note that if a printer registry entry has been created for the 
 report you are printing, the report may automatically print to a specific 
 printer: see <a href="Registry_Viewer.htm">Printer Registry</a> for details).</p>
<h2>Important Fields:</h2>
<p><font style="font-weight: bold;">Report Options:</font> <font style="font-weight: bold;">(for 
 Report Scheduling)</font><br/>
The Report Options selector pane controls how the report will be scheduled 
 with Report Anywhere and output. Click <a href="Report_Options.htm">Report 
 Scheduling Options</a> to view detailed information on Report Scheduling.</p>
<p><font style="font-weight: bold;">Select Company<br/>
</font>The Select Company pane is desined for use with <a href="Intercompany_Processing_Overview.htm">Intercompany 
 Processing</a>. It will list the Company records if any are defined in 
 your database. To run the report the report for a specific company, click 
 on a line to select it. To run the report for all Companies, do NOT select 
 a Company: all will be shown.</p>
<p>If the report is run for all companies, the company name on the report 
 will default from the companyname registry entry. If the report is run 
 for a selected company, the company name on the report will default from 
 the Company record’s Company Name field.</p>
<p><font style="font-weight: bold;">Report Ranges Pane:</font><br/>
The Report Ranges selector pane enables you to select a customized range 
 for the report. When you click on a range, the criteria defining it will 
 appear in the ID field(s). Creating a customized report range is discussed 
 below. Notice that you must name a custom range in order to save it.</p>
<p><font style="font-weight: bold;">Range Name Field:</font><br/>
Enter a unique, alphanumeric name to save and identify your customized 
 report Range. Be sure to tab out of the Range field after entering its 
 name. The Range will be saved when you run the report. When you access 
 the report again, your range will appear in the Report Ranges pane.</p>
<p>You can create user-defined report ranges that are available to all 
 users with access to that report. To do so, the first character of the 
 named range must be an asterisk (*). Named ranges beginning with an asterisk 
 will appear on all users&#39; report ranges options so that they can be selected 
 (but not altered) by any user with access to that report. Only the user 
 that created the report range is allowed to alter it. However, users flagged 
 as a Notes Administrator may delete global ranges defined by other users.</p>
<p style="margin-left: 36.00pt;"><span style="font-weight: bold;">To Remove 
 or Clone a Report Range </span><br/>
When the user right-clicks a saved Range, they will be prompted to Delete 
 or Clone the Range for use by another User.  </p>
<p style="margin-left: 88px;">If Delete is selected, the range will be 
 deleted if allowed: users may delete their own ranges. Notes Administrators 
 may also delete Global ranges created by other Users.</p>
<p style="margin-left: 88px;"><span>If Clone is selected, the User Id field 
 must be completed with the User the range should be given to (if the User 
 already has a range of this name, a warning will be displayed). This User 
 will &#39;own&#39; their copy of the Range and may deleted if desired.</span></p>
<p><font style="font-weight: bold;">Required Settings</font><br/>
In some reports, information must be completed before a report can be run. 
 For example, in the AR Customer Statement report, the Statement Date must 
 be completed before the report can be run. Typically, each Setting allows 
 you to enter only one value. When a Date appears as a setting, you may 
 double-click on it to access the calendar viewer, or enter the date in 
 a <font style="font-style: italic;">mmddyyyy</font> format.</p>
<p><font style="font-weight: bold;">Optional ID and Text Range Fields</font><br/>
For many reports, one or more optional range fields may appear below the 
 required settings. The type and number of range fields varies with which 
 report you are running, but they serve to set the criteria that determines 
 whether or not information appears on the report. If all optional fields 
 are left blank, the report will be run &#39;wide open&#39;.</p>
<p>To limit the report to certain records, you simply specify their Id&#39;s. 
 ID&#39;s may be entered by double-clicking on a field to access the list of 
 Id&#39;s.</p>
<p>Use the following rules when filling in the ID field(s).</p>
<p>A <font style="font-weight: bold;" color="#0000FF">Single ID</font> 
 is specified by simply entering the ID.</p>
<p><font style="font-weight: bold;" color="#0000FF">Several ID&#39;s or Statuses</font> 
 can be specified by using a comma to separate the individual ID&#39;s.</p>
<p style="margin-left: 48px;">Example: to include the items with the ID&#39;s 
 EX1, SA3 and LT5 on the report, they would be entered as follows in the 
 ID field: EX1,SA3,and LT5</p>
<p style="font-weight: bold; margin-left: 48px;">Disable the Following 
 Characters from Search: <span style="font-weight: normal;">The double 
 hyphen character combination may be used to disable the rest of the characters 
 on the line.  Some examples follow:</span>  </p>
<p style="font-weight: bold; margin-left: 88px;"><span style="font-weight: normal;">&#39;--A,B,C&#39; 
 ... removes the filter value entirely<br/>
&#39;A,B --,C&#39; ... removes &#39;C&#39; from the list</span></p>
<p class="Body_Text_Indent" style="margin-left: 0px;">A <span><font style="font-weight: bold;" color="#0000FF">Range of ID&#39;s, Statuses or Dates</font></span> is 
 defined by the first and last items of the range separated by an underscore.</p>
<p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0; margin-left: 48px;">Example: 
 To include all ID&#39;s from AARDVARK to ZEBRA:<br/>
 AARDVARK_ZEBRA  </p>
<p style="margin-left: 8px;"><span style="font-weight: bold;"><font style="font-weight: bold;" color="#0000FF">Multiple Fields</font>.</span> If the Range Viewer 
 includes more than one field, you can optionally enter ID&#39;s in more than 
 one field. Items will appear on a report only if they fit <font style="font-weight: bold;">all</font> 
 the criteria set in the ID fields.</p>
<p>Example: Assume the first ID field is for Clients, and the second is 
 for Account Managers. Let&#39;s suppose you set these fields as follows:</p>
<p>databasics0001_databasics9999</p>
<p>Sam</p>
<p>A client will appear in the report only if its Client ID is within the 
 range databasics0001 to databasics9999 <font style="font-weight: bold;">and</font> 
 if the account manager for that client is Sam.</p>
<p><font color="#0000FF">Date Ranges:</font> should be entered using the 
 following format: <font style="font-style: italic;">yyyy-mm-dd</font>. 
 Note that this format is different from that required by a Date Setting.</p>
<p>Example: June 30, 2015 would be entered as 2015-06-30.</p>
<p>A <font style="font-weight: bold;">string search</font> for specific 
 characters can be implemented in any optional range field by surrounding 
 the text you wish to search for with the % sign.</p>
<p style="margin-left: 18.00pt;">Example: To select only those items whose 
 Name includes the string ring, you would enter %ring% in the Name range. 
 To include only those items whose Name begins with ring, you would enter 
 ring%. To include only those items whose Name ends with ring, you would 
 enter %ring.</p>
<p class="Body_Text_Indent" style="margin-left: 30.25pt;">A similar procedure 
 would be used to filter a report to only include entries with phone numbers 
 beginning with the 216 area code: %(216)%. Notice that we included parentheses 
 around the area code so that it would appear as it does in the database.</p>
<p><font style="font-weight: bold;">Comparison Operators</font><br/>
<span style="font-weight: bold;">&gt;</span>  (Greater Than)<br/>
<span style="font-weight: bold;">&lt;</span>  (Less Than)<br/>
<span style="font-weight: bold;">&gt;=</span>  (Greater Than or Equal 
 To)<br/>
<span style="font-weight: bold;">&lt;=</span> (Less Than or Equal 
 To)</p>
<p>For example, &lt;abcde means that the field value must be less than 
 <font style="font-weight: bold;">abcde</font> to appear in the list or 
 report.</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: bold;">=</span>  (Equal)</p>
<p>To query for blank fields, enter a filter line containing only <font style="font-weight: bold;">=</font> (the equal sign). Entering no 
 operator is equivalent to preceding the value with =. For example, entering 
 <font style="font-weight: bold;">RT567</font> in a filter is equivalent 
 to entering <font style="font-weight: bold;">=RT567</font>.</p>
<p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"> </p>
<p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span style="font-weight: bold;">!</span> 
  (Not)  </p>
<p>This is the NOT operator. For example, <font style="font-weight: bold;">!&gt;</font> 
 (not greater than) is equivalent to <font style="font-weight: bold;">&lt;=</font> 
 (less than or equal to). The <font style="font-weight: bold;">!</font> 
 may also precede a range so that <font style="font-weight: bold;">!ddd_fff</font> 
 will include all values of the field <font style="font-style: italic;">except</font> 
 those in the range ddd to fff.</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: bold;">&lt;&gt;</span>  (operator)</p>
<p>This is synonymous with ! or !=. You may query for non-blank fields 
 by entering a query line containing only <font style="font-weight: bold;">!</font>, 
 <font style="font-weight: bold;">!=</font>, or <font style="font-weight: bold;">&lt;&gt;</font>.</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: bold;">~</span> (Global Not)</p>
<p>The tilde (~) is also a NOT operator. When the first character is a 
 ~ the rest of the filter indicates which records to exclude. For example, 
 <font style="font-weight: bold;">~a,p,m</font> will include all values 
 except a, p or m.</p>
<p><font style="font-weight: bold;">Report Order Selector Pane:</font><br/>
The Report Order Selector Pane at the bottom of the screen enables you 
 to control the report&#39;s order. Select the order in which you want the 
 report to appear.</p>
<p><font style="font-weight: bold;">Lines:</font><br/>
This informational field displays the number of lines per page for this 
 report under the current font setting.</p>
