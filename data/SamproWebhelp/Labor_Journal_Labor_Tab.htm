<h1>Labor Journal Hours Tab</h1>
<h2>Purpose:</h2>
<p>Enter hours in the Labor Journal.</p>

<h2>Important Fields: Hours Detail</h2>
<p><img src="assets/images/image/Magnify.gif" alt="" style="border: none;" border="0"/> 
 Click the Magnify button to display all fields for this line.</p>
<p><img src="assets/images/image/LinesView.gif" alt="" style="border: none;" border="0"/> 
 Click the Lines View button to display the multiple line view.</p>
<p><font style="font-weight: bold;">Start</font> <font style="font-weight: bold;">Time 
 :</font> <font style="font-weight: bold;">End Time</font><font style="font-weight: bold;">: 
 (Custom Fields)</font> <font style="font-weight: bold;"><br/>
</font>If you would like to be able to access these fields for entering 
 and recording employee data, please contact your support representative: 
 a customization file will be needed to display these fields. The following 
 validations will be performed on these fields:</p>
<p>1. Start Time can&#39;t exceed End Time unless End Time is empty.<br/>
2. End Time can&#39;t precede Start Time.<br/>
3. Time must be entered in military (24-hour) format.</p>
<p>Changes to either the Start or End times triggers a computation of the 
 Hours. </p>
<p><font style="font-weight: bold;">Hours:  Hrs Billable:<br/>
</font>Hours (Actual) and Billable Hours. Hours will be used for costing, 
 while Hours Billable will be used to compute revenue for billing purposes. 
 Note that the Hrs Bill field defaults when you enter Hours, but may be 
 adjusted by the user if needed (e.g., enter a single line of labor for 
 a situation where an employee spent three hours on a job (for costing 
 purposes), but you only wished to bill the customer for 2 hours).</p>
<p><font style="font-weight: bold;">Effective Date:</font><br/>
This field defaults from the Effective Date in the header record but may 
 be changed by the user if needed. Enter this date in <font style="font-style: italic;">mmddyyyy</font> 
 format or double-click on this field to access the calendar.</p>
<p><font style="font-weight: bold;">WO Id:</font><br/>
If these hours are to be applied to a specific Service or PM Work Order, 
 enter its Id (or double-click to select from a list). Note that if a Work 
 Order is entered, the Job Id, Job Cost Code, and Billing Item Id&#39;s will 
 default.</p>
<p style="margin-left: 36.00pt;"><font style="font-weight: bold;">Time 
 Applied to PM Work Orders:</font><br/>
The PM Invoice Id is typically set in work orders created via Create PM 
 Work Orders. If the PM Invoice field is completed, then all lines entered 
 for this PM Work Order (excluding those marked extra or having revenue) 
 are recorded as being associated to the PM Invoice that has been previously 
 computed/posted. </p>
<p><font style="font-weight: bold;">Equipment Id:<br/>
</font>If the user enters a Work Order Id, the system will default in the 
 first piece of equipment on the Work Order’s Equipment tab UNLESS this 
 behavior is disabled via registry (see <a href="Registry_Entry_Global_Settings__Column_Compression__Dispatch_Board_Rows__History_Log_Inventory_Markup.htm#global_settings_journal_equipment_id">Registry 
 Option - Do Not Default Equipment Id</a>). If the user double clicks on 
 this field, the system will display a list of all equipment associated 
 with the Client Site referenced in the Work Order.</p>
<p>If the sys-ffv-global setting &#39;DefaultEquipmentFromWorkorder&#39; is set 
 to false, the user is allowed to set the Equipment Id back to blank. If 
 this registry option is not present or set to true, the Equipment Id must 
 be completed if a Work Order Id is referenced.</p>
<p><font style="font-weight: bold;">Job Id:</font><br/>
The Id of the Job these hours are being entered against. You complete this 
 field if you did not enter the Work Order Id is not filled in. If the 
 Effective Date of the entry falls after the Date Closed of the Job (if 
 any), a warning message will be displayed.</p>
<p><font style="font-weight: bold;">Cost Category:</font><br/>
This required field defaults from the Labor Rate if it is specified in 
 the Labor Rate record. Only those Job Cost Categories with a cost type 
 of Labor will be displayed when you double-click this field. Note that 
 if this field is manually changed, the Labor Rate on this line will default 
 to the Labor Rate specified in the selected Cost Category.</p>
<p>When entering hours for a field employee for a indirect (overhead) job, 
 the Cost Category from the Labor Rate is cleared if the previously auto-loaded 
 Cost Category of the selected job would cause a job/cost category error 
 . This allows an appropriate Cost Category to easily be entered manually. For 
 a field employee, when entering hours for a direct job the cost category 
 defaults from the Labor Rate in the employee record as in previous releases.</p>
<p><span>This field supports enhanced filtering provided by the Cost Code&#39;s 
 Job Cost Category Usage Filter. Cost Categories are validated (relative 
 to Cost Codes) during data entry upon leaving the Cost Category Id field. 
  The full relationship is validated again when leaving a child line 
 or saving a record.</span></p>
<p><font style="font-weight: bold;">Job Cost Code Id: Job Billing Item 
 Id:</font><br/>
If the Work Order Id field is not filled in, enter the appropriate Id&#39;s 
 for this Job or double-click to select from a list.</p>
<p><font style="font-weight: bold;">Labor Rate Id: Pay Type Id: Billing 
 Rate Type Id:</font><br/>
These fields default from the Employee record but may be changed by the 
 user. For example, if the default Pay Type is &quot;regular&quot;, you 
 might need to change it to &quot;overtime&quot; if overtime hours are 
 being recorded. You may double-click to select from a list of Id&#39;s. <font style="font-weight: bold;">If a Pay Type/Labor Rate is specified in 
 the Job Cost Category you selected it will override the one entered in 
 the Employee or Job (Prevailing Wages) record.</font></p>
<p style="margin-left: 36.00pt;"><font style="font-weight: bold;">Note 
 on Overhead Jobs:</font> Although the system initially defaults the regular 
 Pay Type Id in the Employee record, the system will check to see if this 
 Job is flagged as Overhead when you enter the Job Id. If it is an Overhead 
 job, the system will look to the Overhead Pay Type Id in the Employee 
 Record and use this for the Labor Journal Entry. If the Overhead Pay Type 
 field is blank in the Employee record, the regular Pay Type will be retained.</p>
<p style="margin-left: 36.00pt;"><font style="font-weight: bold;">Note: 
 Prevailing Wages Jobs</font> <font style="font-weight: bold;">- Employee 
 Overrides</font><font style="font-weight: bold;"><br/>
</font>If you are entering time for a Prevailing Wages Job, the values 
 found in the Employee Overrides tab of the Job record will override the 
 default employee Labor Rate and Pay Type. These wage overrides will only 
 be implemented when the cost code type is set to Field.</p>
<p style="margin-left: 36.00pt;"><font style="font-weight: bold;">Registry 
 Setting: Office/Field Determined by Job Cost Code<br/>
</font>An option of the sys-ffv-global-settings registry entry (<a href="Registry_Entry_Global_Settings__Column_Compression__Dispatch_Board_Rows__History_Log_Inventory_Markup.htm">Registry 
 Entry Global Settings</a> ) enables the system to determine whether hours 
 should be considered &#39;office&#39; or &#39;field&#39; depending on the Job Cost Code&#39;s 
 Work Type setting. If this option is implemented, hours charged to a &#39;Field&#39; 
 Job Cost Code will be considered field hours, regardless of whether the 
 employee is Office or Field.</p>
<p style="margin-left: 36.00pt;"><font style="font-weight: bold;">Note 
 on Entering Labor Lines</font> <font style="font-weight: bold;">with a 
 Billing Rate Type of n/a</font><font style="font-weight: bold;">:<br/>
</font>If the billing type is n/a, the system will not calculate the Amount 
 Revenue when entering labor lines, even if the Revenue Rate is completed! 
 Typically, you would leave the Revenue Rate field blank, and enter the 
 Amount Revenue field directly when billing for labor. Note that if you 
 edit a labor line, selecting a labor rate with a Billing Type of n/a, 
 the Amount Revenue on the labor line will NOT be changed.</p>
<p><font style="font-weight: bold;">Description:</font><br/>
This optional field may be used to briefly describe this time card entry.</p>
<p><font style="font-weight: bold;">Earnings Group Id:</font><br/>
If this employee is a member of an Earnings Group (typically, a Union member), 
 this field defaults from the Employee record and will be used to control 
 earnings calculations for payroll. If this field is empty (typically, 
 non-Union employees), the earnings detail on the ERN tab of the Employee 
 record will be used to control earnings calculations for payroll. Note 
 that if you blank out the Earnings Group Id, and the ERN tab is blank, 
 the employee will not be paid for these hours.</p>
<p><font style="font-weight: bold;">Deduction Group Id:</font><br/>
If this employee is a member of a Deduction Group (typically, a Union member), 
 this field defaults from the Employee record and will be used to calculate 
 payroll deductions. In addition to the deductions specified in the Deduction 
 Group, the deductions specified on the DED tab of the Employee record 
 will <font style="font-weight: bold; font-style: italic;">also</font> 
 be applicable. If this field is empty (typically, non-Union employees), 
 only the deduction detail on the DED tab of the Employee record will be 
 used.</p>
<p style="margin-left: 36.00pt;"><font style="font-weight: bold;">Note: 
 Prevailing Wages Jobs</font><br/>
If you are entering time for a Prevailing Wages Job, the values found in 
 the EMP tab of the Job record will override the default Earnings Group 
 and Deduction Group. Prevailing wage overrides will only be implemented 
 when the cost code type is set to field.</p>
<p><font style="font-weight: bold;">Discipline Id:<br/>
</font>This field defaults from the Job Cost Code record, but may be changed 
 by the user. It is typically used in conjunction with union payroll for 
 reporting purposes.</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: bold;">Supervisor Id:</span><br/>
If completed, this field specifies the Supervisor responsible for the work 
 in this entry.</p>
<p><span><font style="font-weight: bold;">GL Entity:</font><br/>
This field defaults from the Job Cost Code record but may be changed by 
 the user. </span><span>When Intercompany is enabled and a detail line 
 contains a Job Id, any changes to the line&#39;s GL Entity are validated to 
 ensure that the new GL Entity belongs to the same company as the Job. 
 </span>It identifies the profit center to be charged with these hours. 
 You may double-click to select from a list of Id&#39;s.</p>
<p><font style="font-weight: bold;">State Tax Authority:  Local Tax 
 Authority:  Other Tax Authority:</font><br/>
If this entry is for an Office employee, these fields default from the 
 Employee record. If this timecard entry is for a Field employee, these 
 fields default from the Job record. They should reflect the physical location 
 of the employee when he worked these hours for Payroll Tax calculations. 
 You may double-click these fields to select from a list of Tax Authorities.</p>
<p><span>These fields also default from the Employee record when a Bonus 
 amount is entered. If a Field type Cost Code is then selected, the fields 
 are overridden from the Job record. This defaulting works the same as 
 when hours are entered. </span> </p>
<p><font style="font-weight: bold;">Salary:<br/>
</font>This field defaults from the employee record (checked for salaried 
 employees, blank for hourly employees). Note that if this entry is designed 
 to pay a salaried employee an additional amount (such as a bonus), you 
 must blank this field by double-clicking on it.</p>
<p><font style="font-weight: bold;">Extra?</font><br/>
If these hours are an &quot;extra&quot; (not explicitly included in a contract), 
 check this box (by double-clicking or pressing the Spacebar). Doing so 
 flags these hours as eligible for invoicing as a contract extra.</p>
<p><font style="font-weight: bold;">WC Category:<br/>
</font>This field normally defaults from the Employee record if the time 
 entered is for an employee working on an ‘office’ Job. It will also default 
 from the Employee record if this an ‘office’ employee working on a ‘field’ 
 job.</p>
<p class="Tip_Note_Heading" style="margin-top: 4.00pt; font-weight: normal;">The 
 default WC in the Employee record may be overridden by the Worker’s Comp 
 Category (if any) specified in the Job Cost Category record. If you maintain 
 Worker’s Comp Categories for multiple states, a line should be entered 
 for each state. The system will use the WC State field (in the job record) 
 to determine which Workers Comp category to use for each journal entry 
 for field employees.</p>
<p class="Tip_Note_Heading"><span><font style="font-weight: normal;"><img src="assets/images/image/Magnify.gif" alt="" style="border: none;" border="0"/></font> 
 Click the Magnify Button to see the following fields.</span></p>
<p><font style="font-weight: bold;">Bonus Amount:</font><br/>
<span>This field enables you to pay a bonus or commission to your employees. 
 If this field is completed, the Salary box must be blank. Since a Bonus 
 should never be entered on a line which also records hours, validation 
 prevents the user from entering hours and a Bonus on the same line.</span></p>
<p><span>A negative Bonus posts to the GL as follows: Debit to Accrued 
 Payroll and Credit to Expense. Computing Payroll relieves Accrued 
 Payroll correctly for amount of Gross Wages including Credited Bonus. 
 This allows the user to enter bonus line with a negative amount to account 
 for having to reduce a salaried employee&#39;s gross pay.</span></p>
<p><span>The Local, State and Other Tax Authority fields default from the 
 Employee record when a Bonus amount is entered. If a Field type Cost Code 
 is then selected, the fields are overridden from the Job record. This 
 defaulting works the same as when hours are entered. </span> </p>
<p style="margin-left: 48px;"><span style="font-weight: bold;">Important:</span> 
 See <a href="Special_Bonus_Configuration.htm">Special Bonus Posting and 
 Accrual Configuration</a> if the Employee doesn’t get wages over and above 
 the Union wages (Earnings Group) specified in the Employee record&#39;s Default 
 Tab. This setup is required to ensure that the Bonus is posted correctly. 
 </p>
<p>In addition, this field would be used to pay commissions: these would 
 be calculated manually, and the net amount recorded in this field. See 
 <a href="Bonus_Payroll_Checks.htm">Bonus Payroll Checks</a> for additional 
 details.</p>
<p><span>For large or year-end bonuses, the optional Federal and State 
 Tax Rate fields may be completed to tax the bonus at the flat rate specified 
 by the taxing authority.</span></p>
<p style="font-weight: bold;">Federal Tax Rate:<br/>
State Tax Rate:<br/>
These fields provide a flat rate override to the Federal / State Income 
 Tax rate brackets in the Employee&#39;s Federal (FED-M or FED-S) and State 
 Tax Tables. These fields are intended to be used for Bonus pay only. If 
 these field are blank, the applicable Federal / State Tax Table will be 
 used as before.</p>
<p style="font-weight: bold; margin-left: 48px;">Important Notes On Tax 
 Override Usage:</p>
<p style="margin-left: 48px;">1. The overriding federal and/or state tax 
 rates are applied directly to the Bonus Amount with which they are associated. 
  Taxable wage reductions (125, 401k, etc) are NOT applied to the 
 Bonus Amount before computing FIT/SIT using the special tax rates.</p>
<p style="margin-left: 48px;">2. Taxable wage reductions will eventually 
 reduce the Taxable Wages so payroll reports, including W2s, will have 
 the correct info.</p>
<p style="margin-left: 48px;">Consider the example where an employee received 
 a $10,000 bonus with 20% special FIT tax rate, 10% special SIT tax rate 
 and 5% 401k deduction.  In the event special tax rates have been 
 specified, the following is the order in which the calculations occur:</p>
<p style="margin-left: 88px;">Gross Wages = $10,000</p>
<p style="margin-left: 88px;">FIT = $2,000 (10,000 x .2)</p>
<p style="margin-left: 88px;">SIT = $1,000 (10,000 x .1)</p>
<p style="margin-left: 88px;">401k = $500 (10,000 x .05)</p>
<p style="margin-left: 88px;"><span>Taxable Wage = $9,500 (10,000 - 500)</span></p>
<p><font style="font-weight: bold;"><span style="font-weight: bold;">R</span>evenue 
 Rate:<br/>
</font>The rate at which you will bill the customer. The field defaults 
 from the Labor Rate field.</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: bold;">TechAnywhere Source Rn: Technician 
 Id</span> <br/>
If these fields are completed, this record/line was created/revised from 
 TechAnywhere.</p>
