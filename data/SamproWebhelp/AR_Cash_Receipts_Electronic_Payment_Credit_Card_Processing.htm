  <h1>AR Cash Receipts Electronic Payment Credit Card Processing</h1>
  <p>If you have established an account with Electronic Payments and enabled the appropriate registries, you may process a credit card payment or refund in the AR Cash Receipts Journal.</p>
  <p style="margin-left: 48px;"><span style="font-weight: bold;">Note:</span> Edits and deletions to AR lines for Credit Card paid entries are not allowed for Full users. Only Special (support) users are allowed to edit or delete. </p>
  <h5>Processing Receipts with Electronic Payments</h5>
  <p>1. If you use a different sweep account for Electronic Payments receipts, change the Bank Account on the GL tab.</p>
  <p>2. On the Main tab, select Invoice or Invoices that the customer wishes to pay for.</p>
  <p>3. Enter the Discount (if any) and Total Receipt; this is the amount that will be processed on the credit card.</p>
  <p><img alt="" border="0" src="assets/images/Process Payment.bmp" style="border: none;"/></p>
  <p>4. Verify that the customer has their credit card ready, and then click the Process Payment button.</p>
  <p class="MsoNormal">If your firm is set up for Payment Processing and an Invoice or Invoices have been selected for payment, the following happens when the Process Payments button is clicked:</p>
  <p class="MsoNormal" style="margin-left: .5in;">Determine the Client Site associated with each Invoice that has been selected for payment in the transaction being recorded.</p>
  <p class="MsoNormal" style="margin-left: .5in;">If an eligible alias token is NOT found, SAMPro will simply display a message reminding you that you will only have 60 seconds to enter the information; click Yes to continue.  </p>
  <p class="MsoNormal" style="margin-left: .5in;">If one or more Aliases are found, the system will display a list of the eligible Payment Alias/Token values found in the above list of Sites.  To be eligible, a Site&#39;s Alias/Token must have an expiration date greater than or equal to the current system date. </p>
  <p class="MsoNormal" style="margin-left: 88px;">If <b>No Selection</b> is highlighted and the Select button clicked SAMPro will display a message reminding you that you will only have 60 seconds to enter the information; click Yes to continue.  Another message informs you that the journal entry will be added before Payment Processing; click Yes again.  </p>
  <p class="MsoNormal" style="margin-left: 88px;">If an <b>existing Alias</b> is highlighted and the Select button clicked, the system will send the information to Open Edge; if approved, the Credit Card fields will be completed and the Cash Receipt saved.</p>
  <p class="MsoNormal" style="margin-left: 88px;">If the <b>Cancel</b> or red X button is clicked, the list will be closed SAMPro will display a message reminding you that you will only have 60 seconds to enter the information; click Yes to continue or Cancel to opt out of the payment processing.</p>
  <p>5. If an existing alias was not selected, SAMPro will open a &#39;Please Enter Credit Card Information&#39; prompter box.  Enter the customer&#39;s credit card number (without spaces or dashes), expiration date and CVC security code and click OK.</p>
  <p>6 A progress bar will appear as the payment is processed. If the card is not approved,an error with the reason will be displayed (e.g, &quot;Credit Card has expired).  . Check the number and expiration date and try submitting it again.</p>
  <p>7. When the payment is approved, the system will write the Approval Code back to the Check Number field, and complete the CC Masked Account field for future reference.<span> A secure note will be added to the journal entry detailing the transaction. </span></p>
  <p style="margin-left: 8px;">8. When preparing to enter the next Cash Receipt, remember to set the GL Bank Account to the appropriate value.</p>
  <p style="margin-left: 48px;">Note: For Cash Receipt Transactions, SAMPro will also send the SAMPro user ID to column &quot;User ID&quot; of export, and sent the User Def 1 to the Client Id.</p>
  <h5>Processing Credit Refunds</h5>
  <p style="margin-left: 48px;"><span style="font-weight: bold;">Electronic Payment Returns:</span><br/>
    By default, Electronic Payments does NOT process returns. In order to do so, the Return option must be enabled in the Merchant Console.</p>
  <p>1. Select a Credit Memo in the AR Cash Receipts Journal, and enter the Total Receipt as a negative number.</p>
  <p>2. Click the Process Payment button; you will either select an existing alias, or enter the Credit Card information.</p>
  <p><span>3. If the card is approved, the customer&#39;s card will be credited with the refund.  If it is not approved, check the number and expiration date and try submitting it again.</span></p>
  <h5>Work Order COD/Payment Processing</h5>
  <p>If you have established an account with Electronic Payments, you may process a credit card payment from the Work Order’s COD child tab for service work orders (note: this tab may be labeled as Payments in your system).</p>
  <p>1. If this is a taxable Job, use the Compute Sales Tax button to compute the Sales Tax.</p>
  <p>2. Click the Magnify on the COD / Payments child tab.</p>
  <p>3. Enter the Payment Type for your credit card processing, and set the Amount to the total amount to be processed on the credit card, including Sales Tax if applicable.<br/>
     <img src="assets/images/image60.png"/></p>
  <p>4. Verify that the customer has their credit card ready, and then click the Process Payment button.</p>
  <p style="margin-left: 48px;"><strong>New Electronic Payments Functionality: </strong> If the Client Site has a payment alias stored, they will be asked if they want to run this WO COD payment using that credit card on file. If they click yes, it will process the payment then and there and CC transaction information will write back to the WO COD line. If they click No to the question, they will be taken to the usual manual cc entry screen.  </p>
  <p>A secure note is created during the processing of the credit card payment.  The Invoice Id, CRJ Transaction Id &amp; Date Rcvd will be updated on the Work Order COD tab when the COD Service Invoice is later printed &amp; posted.   The Cash Receipt is created when the invoice is later printed &amp; posted. Be sure to process the invoice using the same DATE that the credit card payment was made.  </p>
  <p><strong>Note:  To reverse a COD invoice, the Cash Receipt transaction must be removed.  To remove the CC payment(s) locate the Cash Receipts entries (if there are multiple payments) and 0 out the Total Received and delete off the invoice lines under the A/R child tab. </strong>  </p>
