<h1>Report PR Miscellaneous Deductions Checks</h1>
<h3>Purpose:</h3>
<p>This report enables you to print for check for various types of garnishments 
 that you have withheld from your employee’s pay (child support payments, 
 for example), as well as for deductions such as United Way.</p>
<p>Disposable pay calculations for US 
 and Canadian Payroll users where the garnishment is a percentage of disposable 
 pay are based on the settings of the Disposable Income fields in the <a href="Deductions_Viewer.htm">Deductions</a> records. </p>
<h3>Usage:</h3>
<p>This report must be run <font style="font-weight: bold;">after</font> 
 your regular payroll checks have been printed. Validation prevents the 
 user from closing the Checklist (which appears after confirming the print) 
 by clicking the Windows Red X, abandoning the check run. If the Red X 
 is clicked, the message &quot;This process cannot be canceled&quot; appears. After 
 clearing the message, the user must choose to Post, Reuse or Void the 
 checks, and then click Go.</p>
<p>The applicable fields in the Employee record’s Deduction tab must have 
 been added to enable this processing provide check printing/processing 
 capabilities for Employee PR Deductions.</p>
<p>If your deductions checks are printed for each employee or vendor, the 
 detailed deduction information may not all appear on the check. In this 
 case, the Report PR Miscellaneous Deductions Check Detail function should 
 be run for any checks that require additional detail; see <a href="Report_PR_Deductions_Check_Detail.htm">Report 
 PR Deductions Check Detail</a> for further information.</p>
<p>When Intercompany is enabled, validation 
 ensures that a Company must  selected and the GL Entity completed 
 when the report is run.</p>
<h3>Voiding PR Miscellaneous Deductions Checks</h3>
<p>The Void PR Check function is used to void PR Miscellaneous Deduction 
 checks.</p>
<p>If an Employee Check associated with one or more Payroll Miscellaneous 
 Deduction Checks (PRMD), the system will issue a warning to the user and 
 let them decide whether or not to continue. In this case, voiding the 
 2nd set of garnishment checks (that might be produced after the employee’s 
 check is rerun) should be part of the user’s process. As long as the garnishments 
 are the same, a second set of garnishment checks wouldn&#39;t be required.  Therefore, 
 in that case, the user wouldn&#39;t have a second set of garnishment checks 
 to void. A potential problem occurs if the garnishment checks can&#39;t be 
 voided but the amounts have changed due to the voided and recomputed payroll.  In 
 that case, the user will be required to submit the net difference on a 
 manual check or ask for a refund in the event of an overpayment.</p>
<h5>GL Debit and Credit Posting Entities</h5>
<p>This function supports GL Debit and 
 Credit posting for Deductions withholding (PR Check) &amp; relief (PRMD 
 Check) using the following GL Entity posting precedence:</p>
<p style="margin-left: 48px;">1. As per 
 Employee GL Entity reference if present, else</p>
<p style="margin-left: 48px;">2. As per 
 Deduction Code GL Entity reference if present, else</p>
<p style="margin-left: 48px;">3. As per 
 Respective Check processing &quot;Bank &quot; GL Entity referenced</p>
<h3>Important Fields:</h3>
<p><font style="font-weight: bold;">Payroll Period Id:</font><br/>
Required. Enter a valid Payroll Period Id or double-click on this field 
 to select from a list. The Start and End Check Date display-only fields 
 will be filled in when this Id is entered.</p>
<p><font style="font-weight: bold;">GL Entity Id:</font><br/>
The system uses the combination of GL Entity and GL Account Number when 
 determining the check number sequences. Depending upon how your company 
 data is set up, you would most likely <font style="font-weight: bold;">always</font> 
 specify a GL Entity, or <font style="font-weight: bold;">never</font> 
 specify a GL Entity.</p>
<p><font style="font-weight: bold;">GL Account Id:</font><br/>
(Required.) The bank (cash) account upon which your deduction checks will 
 be drawn.</p>
<p><font style="font-weight: bold;">Check Date</font><br/>
(Required.) The date as it will appear on the check(s). Press the Spacebar 
 to enter today&#39;s date, or double-click to display the calendar viewer. 
 This date must fall within the range specified by the display only Start 
 and End Check Date fields.</p>
<p><font style="font-weight: bold;">Check Number:</font><br/>
The number of the first check to be printed for this range. If you have 
 run checks for this GL Entity/GL Account combination before, the check 
 number will default to the last sequentially used number plus 1. The user 
 may change the Check Number if needed.</p>
<p><font style="font-weight: bold;">Employee Id</font><br/>
If you enter an Employee Id, checks will be limited to Vendors being paid 
 by this employee – however, these Vendor checks will include sums from 
 other employees, if applicable.</p>
<p><font style="font-weight: bold;">Vendor Id:<br/>
</font>This range enables you to select the Vendor or Vendors that you 
 wish to print checks for.</p>
<p><font style="font-weight: bold;">Branch Id</font><br/>
If you enter a Branch Id in this range field (or double-click on this range 
 to select from a list of branches), only Deduction checks for this Branch 
 will be include in the check run.</p>
<p>This report supports the Hard Block 
 logic (implemented by the BranchFilterWithHardBlock global settings registry 
 option) in this version.  The Hard Block is maintained regardless 
 of how the Branch filter range is set.</p>
<p><font style="font-weight: bold;">Cycle:<br/>
</font>Enter the deductions cycle that you wish to limit this check run 
 to.</p>
<p><font style="font-weight: bold;">Executive Payroll:<br/>
</font>This range will be initial set to Y if you are an Executive Payroll 
 User, limiting this check run to employees that are flagged as Executive 
 Payroll. To run deduction checks for all employees, clear this field.</p>
