  <h1>Inventory Restock Pick List Entry</h1>
  <h2>Purpose:</h2>
  <p>This function enables the user to enter the restock quantity actually picked. This function automatically makes inventory history entries adjusting quantity on order, quantity allocated, and quantities on hand.</p>
  <h2>Usage:</h2>
  <p>In previous versions, the system deleted Inventory Restock and Inventory Restock Pick Ticket Entry records when the Pick Ticket was closed. In this release, these records are only deleted if the DeleteClosedTransactions is set to true in the sys-viewer-vrstck entry.</p>
  <p>A Status filter range has been added to the Inventory Restock List and Inventory Restock Pick List Entry viewers. By default, this range is set to Open. To view both Open and Closed entries, click the All filter button. To view only Closed entries, click the Closed filter button.  </p>
  <h2>Registry:</h2>
  <p><a href="Registry_Inventory_Restock.htm">Registry Inventory Restock</a></p>
  <h2>Screen Organization:</h2>
  <p>The upper section of this screen enables you to specify the Restock To and From Locations. Once these fields have been entered, the system will populate the lower section with a list of the items that were picked.</p>
  <h2>Important Fields: Upper Section</h2>
  <p>
    <font style="font-weight: bold;">Transaction Id:</font><br/>
    To access an existing list, you may enter its Transaction Id.
  </p>
  <p>
    <font style="font-weight: bold;">Restock To Location:</font><br/>
    The Location Id that you will restock to (e.g., a truck 1).
  </p>
  <p>
    <font style="font-weight: bold;">Restock From Location:</font><br/>
    The Location Id from which you just picked the inventory (e.g., a regional warehouse).
  </p>
  <p>
    <font style="font-weight: bold;">S</font>
    <font style="font-weight: bold;">tatus: Open Closed<br/>
      Closed By, Date Closed, and Time Closed</font>
  </p>
  <p>These display-only fields are maintained by the system. A Restock entry will be closed by the system when the Close Pick Ticket button is clicked. The Closed By, Date Closed, and Time Closed fields will also be set at this time.</p>
  <p><img alt="image\printpickticket.gif" border="0" height="28" src="assets/images/image/printpickticket.gif" title="image\printpickticket.gif" width="94"/> Click this button to reprint the Restocking Pick Ticket. On the reprint, the quantity to pick will be computed as the original quantity to pick less the quantity already picked.</p>
  <p class="Reference_Line" style="margin-bottom: 0.00pt;"><img alt="image\setqtypicked.gif" border="0" height="17" src="assets/images/image/setqtypicked.gif" title="image\setqtypicked.gif" width="84"/> Click this button to auto fill the quantity picked fields to the value of the quantity to pick fields. At this point, the screen will be as it should be if the user physically picked the quantity appearing on the Restocking Pick Ticket. The user will be free to enter any exceptions in the lower section of this screen, and then Save this record.</p>
  <p><img alt="image\closepickticket.gif" border="0" height="17" src="assets/images/image/closepickticket.gif" title="image\closepickticket.gif" width="84"/> After you have entered the Quantities Picked and saved this record, click the Close Pick Ticket button to close the restock list.</p>
  <p>Select All: This allows users to select all items on the pick list at one time. </p>
  <p><strong> Field:</strong> push-autoSetTransferDone</p>
  <p>At this point, no inventory history records will need to be automatically generated for items fully picked. For the remaining records, the following entries will be generated:</p>
  <p> The quantity on order for the restock-to location will be reduced by the quantity not picked.</p>
  <p> The quantity allocated for the restock-from location will be reduced by the quantity not-picked.</p>
  <p>In previous versions, the system deleted Inventory Restock and Inventory Restock Pick Ticket Entry records when the Pick Ticket was closed. In this release, these records are only deleted if the DeleteClosedTransactions is set to true in the sys-viewer-vrstck entry.</p>
  <h2>Important Fields: Lower Section</h2>
  <p class="Body_Text_Indent" style="margin-left: 5.75pt;">
    <font style="font-weight: bold;">Inventory Item Id: Qty Needed: Qty to Pick: Inventory Item Name:</font><br/>
    These display-only fields default from the Restore List for this location pair.
  </p>
  <p>
    <font style="font-weight: bold;">Qty Picked:</font><br/>
    Enter the quantity actually picked. The Set Qtys Picked button may be clicked to auto-fill this field.
  </p>
  <h2>Important buttons:</h2>
  <p><img alt="" border="0" src="assets/images/image/SKIN1_SaveToDisk.gif" style="border: none;"/> Click the Save button to record your picks.</p>
  <p>When the restocking pick ticket record is saved, the following inventory history postings will be generated:</p>
  <p>The quantity on order for the restock-to location will be reduced by the quantity picked.</p>
  <p>The quantity on hand for the restock-to location will be increased by the quantity picked.</p>
  <p>The quantity allocated for the restock-from location will be reduced by the quantity picked.</p>
  <p>The quantity on hand for the restock-from location will be reduced by quantity picked.</p>
  <p><img alt="image\closepickticket.gif" border="0" height="17" src="assets/images/image/closepickticket.gif" title="image\closepickticket.gif" width="84"/> When you have finished saving your picks, click the Close Pick Ticket button.</p>
