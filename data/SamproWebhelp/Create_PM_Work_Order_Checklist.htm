<h1>Create PM Work Order Checklist</h1>
<h2>Purpose:</h2>
<p>This checklist appears immediately after the Create PM Work Order starter 
 function has been run so that you can verify which PM Work Orders will 
 be generated to the Dispatch Board.</p>
<h2>Usage:</h2>
<p>Required to complete the generation of PM Work Orders.</p>
<h2>Important Fields:</h2>
<p><font style="font-weight: bold;">Do</font><br/>
This field enables you to select which scheduled Work Orders should be 
 generated. A check appears in the Do field if an item is selected; by 
 default, all PM Work Orders are selected. Double-click on the Do field 
 to select or deselect an item (or press the Spacebar when the caret appears 
 on this field). </p>
<p><span>By default, the &#39;Do&#39; box may NOT be cleared for Master Contract 
 lines to assure that associated costs and revenues are in sync with Master 
 Contract values. It may still be cleared for non Master Contract lines. 
 The Clear All button only clears non-Master Contract lines. The Check 
 All button checks all lines. This change is true whether or not the UseMasterContractEquipmentTable 
 global registry is set to true. See </span><b><span style="font-weight: normal;"><a href="Registry_Entry_Create_PM_WO.htm#Allow_De-Selection_of_Master_Contract_PM_Work_Order_Lines">Allow 
 De-Selection of Master Contract PM Work Order Lines</a></span></b><span><b> 
 </b>for a registry to allow lines associated with a Master Contract to 
 be deselected.</span><span style="font-weight: bold;"> </span></p>
<p><font style="font-weight: bold;">Client Site Id: Client Site Name: Equipment 
 Id: Inspect Date:<br/>
Service Agreement#:</font> <font style="font-weight: bold;">Estimated Hours:<br/>
</font>The above fields are displayed for informational purposes so that 
 you can verify which PM&#39;s should be generated.</p>
<p><font style="font-weight: bold;">PM Invoice:<br/>
</font>The last invoice number for the PM job will be displayed here. The 
 purpose is to make any cost charged to this PM work order get posted as 
 billed therefore removing them from the unbilled cost report.</p>
<p style="font-weight: normal;">PM&#39;s associated with Master Contracts pull 
 in the most recent Invoice # for that Master Contract on the Site PM Billing 
 tab.  If a PM is NOT associated with a Master Contract, it pulls 
 in the most recent Invoice # NOT associated a Master Contact on the Site 
 Billing schedule.</p>
<p><font style="font-weight: bold;">Already Done:<br/>
</font>Checking this field allows the user to identify maintenance that 
 has already been completed and therefore does not need a new maintenance 
 work order.  When this option is checked for a given line that is 
 also checked as ‘Do’, a Work Order will not be generated. The Client Site 
 Equipment PM Schedule will display the message ‘NO WO’ in the PM Workorder 
 Id field.  </p>
<p>The following warning will be displayed if the user checks the &#39;Already 
 Done&#39; box:</p>
<p>Warning: Any Deferred Revenue that should be attached<br/>
        to a work order will NOT 
 be generated if the<br/>
        &#39;Already Done&#39; box is checked.</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: normal;">This warning is designed to alert 
 users to issues that would occur if they are writing deferred Earnings 
 to Revenue using the PM Inspection line&#39;s Accrued box and Contract Value 
 fields.  Using these fields attaches a Revenue Adjustment to the 
 PM Inspection Work Order.  When Work Order is invoiced/posted, 
 the revenue is moved from Deferred Revenue to Revenue. If you use the 
 Already Done checkbox in because you’ve already created a manual work 
 order in New Call, this transfer of revenue never happens.</span></p>
<p><font style="font-weight: bold;">Tech Id:<br/>
</font> This field specifies which Technician (if any) will be assigned 
 to the PM. This field defaults from the previous Range screen (if the 
 Tech id on the PM Work Order would have been blank. Otherwise, it will 
 default from Equipment record’s PM Schedule tab, the Equipment record’s 
 Main tab, or the Client Site. It may be adjusted by the user if needed.</p>
<p><font style="font-weight: bold;">Work Requested:<br/>
</font>This field defaulted from the previous Range screen, but may be 
 adjusted by the user if needed. It will be used to set the Work Requested 
 header field and the Work Order Equipment&#39;s Work Requested (followed by 
 Service Tasks / Parts text if applicable).</p>
<p><font style="font-weight: bold;">WO PO#:<br/>
</font>This field usually defaults from the Job and/or Client Site based 
 on the WorkOrderPO option in the sys-start-scrtepmwo registry. It may 
 be adjusted by the user if needed.</p>
<h3>Important Buttons:</h3>
<p><img src="assets/images/image/SKIN1_Check.gif" alt="" style="border: none;" border="0"/> 
 Click the Check button to check (select) every item on the list.</p>
<p style="margin-left: 36.00pt;"><font style="font-weight: bold;">Note:</font> 
 If the RequirePO option is set to true in the sys-start-scrtepmwo registry, 
 the system only checks lines where the PO is completed.</p>
<p><img src="assets/images/image/SKIN1_CheckOff.gif" alt="" style="border: none;" border="0"/> 
  Click to de-select every eligible item on the list. Unless enabled 
 via registry, the &#39;Do&#39; box will NOT be cleared for Master Contract lines 
 to assure that associated costs and revenues are in sync with Master Contract 
 values. See <b><span style="font-weight: normal;"><a href="Registry_Entry_Create_PM_WO.htm#Allow_De-Selection_of_Master_Contract_PM_Work_Order_Lines">Allow
