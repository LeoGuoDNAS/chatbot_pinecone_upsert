<h1>Client Order Items Tab</h1>
<p class="Reference_Line" style="margin-bottom: 0.00pt;">Items that have 
 been picked / invoiced cannot be deleted from this tab. In addition, the 
 quantity cannot be reduced below what has already been picked. The price 
 of invoiced items cannot be changed.</p>
<p class="Reference_Line" style="margin-bottom: 0.00pt;"><span id="BugEvents33">The 
 user can delete a line referencing a cancelled line from a Purchase Order 
 or Change Order PO.</span></p>
<h2>Important Fields</h2>
<p><img src="assets/images/image/Magnify.gif" alt="" style="border: none;" border="0"/> 
 Click the Magnify button to display all fields for the selected line.</p>
<p><img src="assets/images/image/LinesView.gif" alt="" style="border: none;" border="0"/> 
 Click the Lines View button to display the multiple line view.</p>
<p><font style="font-weight: bold;">Cost: Revenue: GM$: GM%:</font> <font style="font-weight: bold;">Markup%<br/>
</font>A Cost, Revenue, Gross Margin $, Gross Margin % and Markup% summary 
 for the order is displayed at the top of this tab. This information is 
 dynamically updated as the order is being entered.</p>
<p style="margin-left: 36.00pt;"><font style="font-weight: bold;">Note:</font> 
 Client Orders created prior to 8.2.529.011 will display a Unit Cost of 
 0.00. Orders created from this version forward will display the cost that 
 was defaulted when the line was entered.</p>
<p><font style="font-weight: bold;">Drop Ship?<br/>
</font>Flag this field if this item should be drop-shipped from your vendor 
 directly to the client’s site.</p>
<p>The Dropship can be set after entering the Inventory Id:</p>
<p style="margin-left: 36.00pt;">- If No PO has been generated for the 
 line - Allow Drop Ship Checkbox to be checked or unchecked after the Item 
 Id has been entered.<br/>
<br/>
- If a PO has already been generated for the line - DO not allow the checkbox 
 to be cleared unless the PO has been cancelled.</p>
<p style="margin-left: 36.00pt;">- Validation prevents the setting of the 
 Drop Ship flag if the line is on a pick ticket or has been invoiced.</p>
<p>When you click the Add or Save button, and the Order Type is set to 
 Order, the Drop Ship Wizard launches so that a PO can automatically be 
 generated to a Vendor. Click <a href="Client_Order_Drop_Ship_Wizard.htm">Client 
 Order Drop Ship Wizard</a> for details on using the wizard.</p>
<p style="margin-left: 36.00pt;"><font style="font-weight: bold;">Tip</font>: 
 You can save an order with drop shipments as a ‘quote’ without invoking 
 the wizard. When the quote becomes an order, the operator will change 
 the order type from ‘quote’ to ‘order’. The Drop Ship Wizard will then 
 be invoked when the order is saved.</p>
<p style="margin-left: 36.00pt;"><font style="font-weight: bold;">Tip</font><font style="font-weight: bold;">: Customer</font> <font style="font-weight: bold;">Changes 
 Order</font><br/>
Assume that your customer calls up and wants some material. You create 
 a new Client Order, add 20 items, all of which are to be drop shipped. 
 You create the PO through the wizard. ½ Hour later customer calls up and 
 says that they won’t need 5 of those items.</p>
<p style="margin-left: 36.00pt;">To correct this, you can&#39;t delete the 
 line off the Client Order until you delete it off the PO (which it does 
 allow). Then the line(s) will delete.</p>
<p style="margin-left: 36.00pt;"><font style="font-weight: bold;">Invoicing 
 Drop Shipped Items:<br/>
</font>Drop-shipped items will not appear on the COP Invoice until the 
 PO has been vouchered in the AP Journal or the items have been received 
 in the Inventory Receipts Journal (a registry entry is required: <a href="Registry_Entry_Global_Settings__Column_Compression__Dispatch_Board_Rows__History_Log_Inventory_Markup.htm#global_settings_receive_dropship_IRJ">Global 
 Settings: Receipt Dropship in IRJ</a> ) .</p>
<p><font style="font-weight: bold;">Inventory Item Id:</font><br/>
Your company&#39;s Inventory Item Id (double-click to select from a list of 
 items). If the customer has ordered this item previously, you may instead 
 enter the Customer Part # and press Enter to pop up your Inventory Item 
 number. This Inventory Item will actually be relieved from stock when 
 the order is completed. Only active items may be purchased.</p>
<p>If this is a transfer order, then the client’s description will be set 
 to the inventory item name.</p>
<p class="Tip_Note_Heading" style="margin-top: 4.00pt;"><font style="font-weight: normal;">If 
 the user clears the Inventory Item Id, the other fields on the line (like 
 quantity allocated) are also cleared.</font></p>
<p>The system also checks to see if a part has been superceded (the Superceded 
 By field on the Inventory Other Tab is filled in). When a superseded part 
 number is entered into this field, the system will alert the user that</p>
<p style="margin-left: 36.00pt;">Item A has been superceded by Item B. 
 Use New Item?</p>
<p>It the user clicks Yes, the new part (B) will be returned to the field. 
 If the user clicks No, part A (which has been superceded) will remain 
 in the field.</p>
<p><font style="font-weight: bold;">Order Quantity:</font><br/>
The quantity being ordered or quoted.</p>
<p><font style="font-weight: bold;">Unit Cost:<br/>
</font>The Unit Cost field defaults from the Inventory Item record when 
 a new line is entered. If the Item&#39;s Cost is specified as Average, the 
 Unit Cost is set based on the Inventory Location (if available) specified 
 on the Order first, then the overall cost if the cost by Location is not 
 available.</p>
<p style="margin-left: 36.00pt;"><font style="font-weight: bold;">Note:</font> 
 Client Orders created prior to 8.2.529.011 display a Unit Cost of 0.00. 
 Orders created from this version forward display the cost that defaulted 
 when the line was entered.</p>
<p><font style="font-weight: bold;">Unit Price:</font><br/>
The price charged per unit, exclusive of discounts. If this item is flagged 
 for unit pricing, this field defaults from the Inventory Item record based 
 on the Pricing Level specified in this customer&#39;s record. If you leave 
 this field blank, it will be calculated by the system when you enter the 
 extended price.</p>
<p style="margin-left: 36.00pt;"><font style="font-weight: bold;">Price 
 Code Handling:<br/>
</font>The Inventory Item allows for 10 levels of Material Pricing, but 
 Price Codes only allow for 5. If price codes are in effect, and the default 
 price level from the Client Site is greater than 5, the system now defaults 
 price level 1 from the Price Code. A registry entry <a href="Registry_Entry_Global_Settings__Column_Compression__Dispatch_Board_Rows__History_Log_Inventory_Markup.htm#globel_settings_price_code">Price 
 Code Handling (sys-ffv-global-settings)</a> is available to always default 
 the value from the Price Code level 1, regardless of the Material Price 
 Level in the Client Site.</p>
<p style="margin-left: 36.00pt;"><span style="font-weight: bold;">Prices Codes Using Margins:</span><br/>
If there is a match with the Site&#39;s and Inventory Item&#39;s Price Code, the 
 system inserts the appropriate Margin based on the Site&#39;s Price Level 
 when the Inventory Item is selected. When the user enters and tabs out 
 of the Quantity field, the margin will be converted to the appropriate 
 Unit Price based on the cost.</p>
<p style="margin-left: 36.00pt;"><font style="font-weight: bold;">Foreign 
 Currency Processing -</font> <font style="font-weight: bold;">Unit Price: 
 Extended Price:<br/>
</font>If foreign currency processing is implemented on your system (and 
 this Client Order is for a foreign customer), these fields should be entered 
 in terms of the customer’s foreign currency, as it should appear on the 
 invoice.</p>
<p><font style="font-weight: bold;">Alloc Qty:<br/>
</font>This field defaults from the Quantity Ordered, but may be adjusted 
 downward by the user in order to force a backorder of the item. Note that 
 the Quantity Allocated cannot exceed the Quantity Ordered - Quantity Shipped.</p>
<p><font style="font-weight: bold;">Ext&#39;d Price</font><br/>
This is calculated by the system based on the Order Quantity, Unit Price, 
 and Discount fields.</p>
<p><font style="font-weight: bold;">Disc:</font><br/>
The discount (if any) for this item as a percentage (e.g., 5% would be 
 entered as 5.0).</p>
<p>This field defaults from the Client Site COP tab’s Discount field if 
 Special Pricing is NOT in effect. If Special Pricing is NOT in effect, 
 the Price itself will be set from the Site’s Last Time Bought (if applicable), 
 or the item’s regular Unit Price. If &#39;Special Pricing&#39; is in effect, the 
 Discount Percent field will default to zero.</p>
<p>Special Pricing is in effect if and only if both the following are true:</p>
<p style="margin-left: 36.00pt;">The Client Site’s Price Code Id (on the 
 Client Site&#39;s Contacts tab) is completed.</p>
<p style="margin-left: 36.00pt;">A Pricing Exception for that Price Code 
 exists on the Inventory Item&#39;s Pricing tab.</p>
<p><font style="font-weight: bold;">Allow Partial Ship?</font><br/>
Flag this field if a partial shipment of this item is allowed. Double-click 
 on this field (or press the Spacebar) to flag/clear it.</p>
<p><font style="font-weight: bold;">Substitute Item:</font><font style="font-weight: bold;"><br/>
</font>The LastTimeSold tab of the Client Site viewer shows a list of inventory 
 items sold to the site along with information about the last sale. This 
 information is based on the substitute rather than on the actual inventory 
 item. NOTE: unless specifically entered differently on the Client Order, 
 the actual and substitute items are identical.</p>
<p style="margin-left: 36.00pt;"><font style="font-weight: bold;">Enhanced</font> 
 <font style="font-weight: bold;">Substitute Item Number Functionality:<br/>
1.</font> When entering an order line, enter the item number the customer 
 thinks he is getting in the Inventory Item Id field – not the Substitute 
 Item Field. This will properly load up the item description and the cost 
 for the last time the customer ordered that item (see the Client Site 
 Sales tab). It will also set the Substitute item number to the item number 
 entered.</p>
<p style="margin-left: 36.00pt;"><font style="font-weight: bold;">2.</font> 
 Then, change the item number in the Inventory Item Id field to the item 
 number actually to be shipped.</p>
<p style="margin-left: 36.00pt;"><font style="font-weight: bold;">3.</font> 
 The system will ask if you want to copy this to the substitute item number 
 field. Answer ‘No’.</p>
<p style="margin-left: 36.00pt;"><font style="font-weight: bold;">4.</font> 
 Proceed as usual. At this point, the first field on the child tab is the 
 &#39;actual&#39; item number. That is, this is the item that is withdrawn from 
 inventory. The &#39;substitute&#39; part number only appears on paperwork. The 
 customer thinks that they are getting the &#39;substitute&#39; item but they are 
 really getting the &#39;actual&#39; item.</p>
<p style="margin-left: 36.00pt;">The ‘substitute’ item will appear on the 
 COP Invoice and Order Acknowledgement that is sent to the customer.</p>
<p style="margin-left: 36.00pt;">On the Pick Ticket, the first page lists 
 the Substitute Item so that this page may be sent to the customer as a 
 packing slip. The second page of the Pick Ticket is flagged as “INTERNAL 
 COMMENTS – DO NOT SHIP THIS PAGE TO CLIENT”, and shows the part substitution 
 as follows:</p>
<p style="margin-left: 66.25pt;">***** PART NUMBER SUBSTITUTION *****</p>
<p style="margin-left: 66.25pt;">For this Part Number Substitute this 
 Part</p>
<p style="margin-left: 66.25pt;">123100*   123105</p>
<p><font style="font-weight: bold;">PO Id:<br/>
</font>If completed, this display-only field lists the PO generated by 
 the Drop Ship Wizard.</p>
<p><img src="assets/images/image/magnifybutton.gif" alt="image\magnifybutton.gif" title="image\magnifybutton.gif" width="16" height="16" border="0"/> Click the Magnify button 
 to view the following fields!</p>
<p><font style="font-weight: bold;">Backordered: Available:<br/>
U of Measure Needed: To Pick:</font><br/>
These display-only fields are maintained by the system as follows:<br/>
 Available=OnHand-Allocated<br/>
 Backordered=Needed-Available</p>
<p><font style="font-weight: bold;">Repacking Charge:</font><br/>
If a Repack Table is specified in the Inventory Item record, the repack 
 charge per unit will default based on the quantity ordered and standard 
 container size.</p>
<p><font style="font-weight: bold;">Customer Part #:</font><br/>
The Customer&#39;s part number for this item. If the customer has previously 
 ordered this item, the system will automatically fill in the Customer 
 Part Number for you.</p>
<p><font style="font-weight: bold;">Date Requested:</font><br/>
Defaults from the Date Ordered field. This may adjusted by the user as 
 needed.</p>
<p><font style="font-weight: bold;">Date Promised:</font><br/>
Defaults from the QTE tab in the inventory record if this item was added 
 automatically when the PO and Client Site Id&#39;s were specified.</p>
<p><font style="font-weight: bold;">Date To Ship:</font><br/>
The target shipping date for this item - it defaults from the Ship Date 
 on the Main tab. May adjusted by the user as needed. It controls which 
 items are eligible to appear on the COP Pick List report, Only items with 
 today&#39;s date or earlier are eligible for inclusion on this report.</p>
<p><font style="font-weight: bold;">Price Level:</font><br/>
The price level: this field defaults from the corresponding Price Level 
 field in the header (upper) portion of this viewer. If the price level 
 is changed for this particular item, the system will automatically update 
 the Unit Price if this inventory item is flagged as using unit pricing.</p>
<p><font style="font-weight: bold;">GL Entity Id:</font><br/>
Defaults from the Location record (first), Client Site record (second) 
 or Inventory Group (third). The GL entity in the Location will override 
 the GL entity specified on the Client Site and Inventory Item Group. If 
 you want the Client Site to supply the entity do not enter one in the 
 Location. To default the GL Entity from the Inventory Item Group, the 
 GL Entity field should be blank in both the Location and the Client Site 
 records.</p>
<p style="margin-left: 48px;"><span style="font-weight: bold;">InterCompany 
 Note:</span> If Intercompany is enabled in your database, use the Client 
 Order&#39;s <a href="Registry_Entry_Client_Order_Viewer.htm#Setting_the_GL_Entity">GL 
 Entity Registry</a> entry to determine where the GL Entity should default 
 from: </p>
<p><font style="font-weight: bold;">Pkg Qty</font><br/>
This field defaults from the quantity ordered.</p>
<p><font style="font-weight: bold;">Customer&#39;s Description</font><br/>
Briefly describes this item.</p>
<p><font style="font-weight: bold;">Serial Number:<br/>
</font>The Serial Number field appears on the single view pane for the 
 line.</p>
<p>If a serial number is entered at order entry time, it should appear 
 on all resulting inventory history records.</p>
<p>If a serial number is entered at order entry time, instructions will 
 appear on the pick ticket to pick the indicated serial number.</p>
<p><font style="font-weight: bold;">Additional Unit Cost:<br/>
</font>This field appears on the single view pane for the line.</p>
<p>The additional unit cost should propagate to the imhstry and clntordrtoshp 
 tables.</p>
<p>The additional unit cost should be included when extending the item 
 cost and should be reflected in the Sales Journal entries generated when 
 the invoice is posted.</p>
