<h1>Job Budget Entry Tab</h1>
<h3>Purpose:</h3>
<p>Entries made in this tab will be written to Job History as Budget entries. Edits and changes to these lines will also be written to JCH. This tab also allows for the import of budget data from a .csv spreadsheet.</p>
<h3>Usage:</h3>
<p>The Budget Entry child tab provides a quick way to record budgets for small jobs, but does not replace the Job Journal budgeting functionality. Users that record Budget Changes should generally continue to use the Job Journal as the budget entry point.</p>
<p>By default, the Effective Date of budget entries generated from this tab is blank. A registry entry may be used to set the Effective Date to the Job’s Open Date (see Registry Entries section below).</p>
<p>Note that Budget lines are NOT cloned when a Job is cloned.</p>
<p><font style="font-weight: bold;">Editing Budget Entries:<br/></font>The Budget tab functions like the other SAMPro journals. If it is necessary to change a line, simply change it to the desired value and save the record. If your firm needs Budget Change functionality, the Job Journal should be used to record Budgets.</p>
<h3>Registry Entries:</h3>
<p>By default the Effective Date of Budget Entries posted to Job History via the Budget tab is set to blank (1900-01-01). This could cause issues when compiling a WIP summary report.  For example, suppose the user runs a WIP summary report for say 03/31/2010, and then places new jobs in service in April.  If the user must re-run the report for the end of March (03/31/2010) the totals will change (using the budgets from Job Viewer) whereas, using the Job Journal or if the budgets had a date they would have remained consistent. A registry option (see <a href="Registry_Entry_Job_and_Job_Cloning.htm">Job Registry Entries</a> ) causes entries from the Job’s Budget tab to use the Date Opened from the Job record for both forwarding and reversing entries:</p>
<h3>Important Fields:</h3>
<p><font style="font-weight: bold;">Hours:</font> <font style="font-weight: bold;">Quantity:</font><font style="font-weight: bold;"><br/></font>The Hours fields should be used to record labor budgets lines, and the Quantity field should be used to record material or other items. On a single line, fill in either the Hours or Quantity field.</p>
<p><font style="font-weight: bold;">Inventory Item:<br/></font>This option field would be used if you are budgeting for specific parts. Note that the cost / revenue for this part must be specified by the user (or imported from a spreadsheet); these values will not default from inventory history.</p>
<p><font style="font-weight: bold;">Cost Category:<br/></font>Enter (or import) an appropriate Job Cost Category for this line. For example, a Cost Category of type Labor should be selected for Hours entries. This field is required.  </p>

<p>This field supports enhanced filtering provided by the Cost Code&#39;s Job Cost Category Usage Filter. Cost Categories are validated (relative to Cost Codes) during data entry upon leaving the Cost Category Id field.  The full relationship is validated again when leaving a child line or saving a record.</p>

<p><font style="font-weight: bold;">Job Cost Code: Job Billing Item:<br/></font>The Cost Code and Billing Item this budget is assigned to. These fields are required.</p>
<p><font style="font-weight: bold;">Unit Cost: Extended Cost:</font><br/>
The Unit Cost must be entered by the user or imported a spreadsheet. If entering the budget manually, the system will multiply the Hours or Quantity by the Unit Cost to calculate the extended cost.</p>
<p><font style="font-weight: bold;">Billing Type: Revenue Rate: Extended Revenue:<br/></font>By default, the billing type is set to n/a so that the user can enter/import the Revenue directly. To have the system calculate the Extended Revenue for you, select a Billing Type and enter a Revenue Rate.</p>
<h3>Important Buttons:</h3>
<p style="margin-left: 8px;"><img alt="" src="assets/images/SKIN1_IMB.bmp" style="border: none;" border="0"/> The Import Budget button may be used to import budget data from an estimator’s spreadsheet (click <a href="Job_Budget_Spreadsheet_Format.htm">Job Budget Spreadsheet Format</a> for the format details).  </p>
<p>The system will determine how any existing budget lines should be handled:</p>
<p style="margin-left: 48px;">Click &#39;Yes&#39; to REPLACE all existing lines on the Budget tab.<br/>
Click &#39;No&#39; to ADD the imported lines to the Budget tab.<br/>
Click &#39;Cancel&#39; to end the import without updating the budget lines.</p>
<p>If you click Yes (to replace) or No (to add the imported lines to the existing ones), a browser window will open. Browse to the desired spreadsheet and click Save.</p>
<p>If the system detects any problems with the spreadsheet, it will display them. The spreadsheet must be corrected before it can be imported. You may print and then close the ‘workspace’ listing of errors.</p>
<p style="margin-left: 48px;"><span id="BugEvents111" style="font-weight: bold;">Superceded Items:</span> <span>If an inventory item is marked as being superceded the wizard will alert the user that there are superceded inventory items in the input file. The user is prompted to press Yes and continue (using the superceded items) or No which will allow them to go into the input document and correct it. A text box (which can be printed) will be opened, listing the original items and their superceding Item Ids.</span></p>
<p>Once the Budget lines have been imported, remember to Save the Job record. Doing so will make the appropriate budget entries to Job History.</p>

<p><img src="assets/images/SKIN1_ImportWBS.bmp" alt="" style="border: none;" border="0"/> This button launches the WBS/Budget import function for construction billing.  Compute JCH Unbilled Revenue is automatically run the import so that when a Job Billing Item is created or updated the Cost Code and Billing Items will be re-aligned if needed. The system imports a file or reads a database table looking for data that hasn’t been previously imported. When found, if budget information for the job exists, the user will be given the option to replace the existing WBS/Budget information or append the new data to the existing WBS/Budget. If no budget exists, the system will create new Job Cost Codes based on the WBS information provided and create job cost budget entries for the associated costs.</p>

<p class="MsoListParagraphCxSpMiddle" style="margin-left: 48px;">If a budget exists and “append” is selected, the system will create any new Job Cost Codes found in the data and create job cost budget entries for the associated costs.</p>

<p class="MsoListParagraphCxSpMiddle" style="margin-left: 48px;">If a budget exists and “replace” is selected, the system will delete all Job Cost Codes (that don’t have actual costs posted in JC History), delete all existing job budget entries, mark the date closed on any “orphaned” (has actual cost) Job Cost Codes and then create new Job Cost Codes based on the WBS information provided and create job cost budget entries for the associated costs.</p>

<p class="MsoListParagraphCxSpMiddle" style="margin-left: 48px;">The Import will clear the Cost Code&#39;s Date Completed when the following conditions are true:</p>

<p class="MsoListParagraphCxSpMiddle" style="margin-left: 48px;">1. Cost Code record already exists in SAMPro.<br/>
2. The existing Cost Code record has no budget prior to the import.</p>

<p class="MsoListParagraphCxSpMiddle" style="margin-left: 8px;">See <a href="WBS_Overview.htm">WBS Overview</a> for additional information on this process and for the special spreadsheet format and registries needed for this function.</p>
