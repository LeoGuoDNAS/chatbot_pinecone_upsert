 <P class="support" >2007-12-04 -version 6.1.358.070</P>
 <P class="support" >1995&nbsp;2007 W-2 Format Changes</P>
 <P class="support" >In the actual W-2, the Social Security Number has been moved to the government mandated position so that it will not show through an envelope window. The Control number has also been relocated.  Note that the Plain Paper copy does not reflect these changes. </P>
 <P class="support" >2007-11-21 - version 6.1.358.069</P>
 <P class="support" >219&nbsp;ODBC Statements</P>
 <P class="support" >2007-11-09 (JB)-version 6.1.358.068</P>
 <P class="support" >219&nbsp;ODBC Statements – system primitive failed error - replaces lost code</P>
 <P class="support" >1974&nbsp;Improved code merge technology – internal refinements – see case for details</P>
 <P class="Support_Heading_2" >Build 67</P>
 <P class="support" >1818&nbsp;Inventory Item Serialized Tab – corrects various display issues</P>
 <P class="support" >1841&nbsp;Error detection on Save – TechAnywhere (Internal)</P>
 <P class="Style_Support_+_Left___0_5_" >Any errors detected during the emulation of the Save button are now being transferred to the FieldFormViewer instance's list of detected errors. This effects only certain applications which use Data Entry Emulation mode to update records. There are just two such applications: the Kappus Blackberry Tech Anywhere project and the regular Tech Anywhere when it updates a Client Site Equipment record.</P>
 <P class="Style_Support_+_Left___0_5_" >Before this change, if the actual writing of a new record encountered an error, this error was not properly identified and not properly handled. This could result in the record not being saved while the application thought the save was successful.</P>
 <P class="support" >1795&nbsp;Inventory Adjustments Journal – correct stack overflow problem caused by earlier code. </P>
 <P class="support" >1818&nbsp;Inventory Item Serialized tab </P>

 <P class="Style_Support_+_Left___0_5_" >Also sets PO Id for Inventory Adjustments</P>
 <P class="support" >1518&nbsp;GL Type Reports</P>
 <P class="Style_Support_+_Left___0_5_" >Corrects problem with GL Type Reports when a report is defined with both the Font For Report Lines and Font For Heading Lines set as bold. If both these fields were set to bold, the user got an error lineSpacing Not Understood.&nbsp;Also note that if the Heading Font was not the default and the Line Font was the default, the number of lines per inch were being determined by the heading, not the line. This patch fixes this unreported problem.</P>
 <P class="support" >1795&nbsp;Inventory Adjustments Journal – relax serialized inventory constraints – Kappus only</P>
 <P class="support" >1765&nbsp;CSRAnywhere – corrects display of on-hand serialized inventory – Kappus customization</P>
 <P class="support" >1754&nbsp;Remote Time Entry (Dialect)</P>

 <P class="support" >1524&nbsp;Inventory Restock Function</P>
 <P class="Style_Support_+_Left___0_5_" >The methodology has been changed in this function. Effective now...the &quot;trigger&quot; mechanism is that when &quot;on hand&quot; quantity is less than the &quot;reorder level&quot;, an item will qualify for replenishment, and the Quantity to PICK will be however many are required to bring the &quot;on hand&quot; quantity up to the &quot;Order Up To Level.<BR><BR>for instance...if 2 are on hand<BR>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; 3 is the reorder level<BR>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; 10 is the order up to<BR><BR>then an item would qualify for 8 to be picked.</P>
 <P class="Support_Heading_2" >Build 66</P>
 <P class="support" >1268&nbsp;Start EOM Unvouchered Payables</P>

 <P class="support" >1384&nbsp;1.16 Daylight Savings Time</P>
 <P class="Style_Support_+_Left___0_5_" >SAM Pro has been updated to conform to the new rules that, starting in March 2007, daylight time in the United States will begin on the second Sunday in March and end on the first Sunday in November.  This information is used for Time Zone offsets.  It is dependent upon a correct server time; be sure to verify that your customers servers are displaying the correct time when Daylight Savings goes into effect. </P>
 <P class="Support_Heading_2" >Build 65</P>
 <P class="support" >1362&nbsp;Implement a registry entry that relaxes the restrictions on Labor Journal edits </P>
 <P class="Style_Support_+_Left___0_5_" >This registry entry relaxes the restrictions on edits to transactions where the Payroll Period is no longer active and/or the Employee has already been paid for the Pay Period.&nbsp; Changes to the parent record (Employee Id, Total Hours, Pay Period, etc.) will NOT be permitted. It's also important to note that changes to Cost Codes and Cost Categories (which may change GL Accounts and/or Entities) will not be reflected in the general ledger.</P>
 <P class="support" >Id: sys-viewer-vlbrjrnl<BR>Contents: AllowEditAfterPayrollProcessed=true</P>
 <P class="Support_Heading_2" >Build 64</P>
 <P class="support" >1326&nbsp;W2 Partial Year Reporting – see user notes 2.32. 1/24 image includes fix for Sybase 7 databases.</P>
 <P class="Support_Heading_2" >Build 63</P>
 <P class="support" >1174&nbsp;Inventory Adjustment Journal </P>
 <P class="support" >&nbsp;For serialized items, a ‘to’ location must be specified if a ‘from’ location is.</P>
 <P class="support" >1242&nbsp;Fix typo for Compute PR when Allow FICA Exemption is in use – see case for details</P>
 <P class="support" >1240&nbsp;Compute Service Invoice</P>
 <P class="Style_Support_+_Left___0_5_" >Prevents reprinting of invoice while post in progress, which could result in double post of invoice.</P>
 <P class="Style_Support_+_Left___0_5_" ><FONT style="font-weight:bold; " >IMPORTANT:</FONT> this patch does not prevent reprinting of invoices if the olddialog registry option is set in sys-printer-dialog-ssrvcebllngcmpte. The old dialog option enables you to select the alternate print tray for invoice stationary. It is advised that you avoid the olddialog option and instead set up an additional print driver to select when printing invoices that specifies the appropriate paper drawer as the default. <FONT style="font-weight:bold; " > </FONT></P>
 <P class="support" >1192&nbsp;GL Report 3 – now adjusts line spacing when font size changed</P>
 <P class="support" >1191&nbsp;User Defined Report 2 – now adjusts line spacing when font size changed</P>
 <P class="support" >1160&nbsp;Work Order Viewers</P>
 <P class="support" >&nbsp;The system now prevents you from deleting invoiced lines (unless you first reverse them).</P>
 <P class="support" >1133&nbsp;Inventory Receipts Journal</P>
 <P class="Style_Support_+_Left___0_5_" style="margin-top:0;margin-bottom:0"> Now validates the Date Received against eligible dates in the accounting period selected.&nbsp; This will prevent users from selecting dates that are in closed accounting periods, by selecting an active period and using closed dates.&nbsp;</P>
 <P class="support" >1169&nbsp;Fill Backorders for Shop – fixed SQL Service incompatibility – see case for details.</P>
 <P class="Support_Heading_2" >Build 62</P>
 <P class="support" >1165&nbsp;New Call WO History Pane now displays Work Code from WO Equipment lines </P>
 <P class="support" >1123&nbsp;Fixes problem with launch of PO from WO caused by this enhancement</P>
 <P class="support" >1091&nbsp;crv Registry Entry (for CrystalView) – means to extract additional registry settings</P>
 <P class="support" >AdditionalRegistrySettings=<FONT style="font-style:italic; " >registry1,registry2,...</FONT></P>
 <P class="Style_Support_+_Left___0_5_" >If found in the crv registry setting, this will pass the appropriate registry settings implemented by the specified registry entries to Crystal View. Note that if multiple registry entries are specified, they should be separated with commas.</P>
 <P class="support" >Example:</P>
 <P class="support" >AdditionalRegistrySettings=sys-email</P>
 <P class="support" >This passes the sys-email registry options settings to CrystalView so that email settings used for SAM Pro will also be available for Crystal View. </P>
 <P class="support" >1123&nbsp;General Viewer technology performance enhancement</P>
 <P class="Style_Support_+_Left___0_5_" >Some viewers (the Inventory Item Viewer, for example) can exhibit very poor performance when generating the record list screen. The problem is actually that after generating the list, the method eventRecordRetrieved is invoked, even though no record has been chosen. The logic is convoluted and dangerous to modify. However it is clear that the referenced record is the empty record. Modify the process so as not to invoke eventRecordRetrieved at this inappropriate time.</P>
 <P class="support" >1126&nbsp;Dispatch Board – Classic Board</P>
 <P class="Style_Support_+_Left___0_5_" >When you change the Date and the tech of a WO on the classic board, using the bottom of the screen, and save it, it did not actually change the tech, just the date. Problem corrected.</P>
 <P class="support" >1079&nbsp;Dispatch Board – internal, see case for details.</P>
 <P class="support" >1073&nbsp;Bank Reconciliation and Clear Checks</P>
 <P class="Style_Support_+_Left___0_5_" >The system no longer lists Checks reconciled via Clear Check when the AutoFill button is clicked. This enhancement enables users who have previously been using Clear Check to switch over to the new Bank Reconciliation functionality.</P>
 <P class="support" >1041&nbsp;Data Conversion Utility – bad date handling, see case for details.</P>
 <P class="support" >1099&nbsp;Cost Code and Billing Item not Filtered by Job Record</P>
 <P class="Style_Support_+_Left___0_5_" >Corrects problem (introduced for a couple of builds by case 1070) on clicking Billing Item / Cost Code icons in Job record.</P>
 <P class="support" >1070&nbsp;Changes to Work Orders (and other records) not prompting for save</P>
 <P class="Style_Support_+_Left___0_5_" >If you change a field in a record, and, without leaving the field, switch back to the pick list, the viewer was unaware of the changed field and did not prompt for save.  Corrects problem. </P>
 <P class="support" >1090&nbsp;AP Journal – deny changes to PO # on existing AP Journal entries</P>
 <P class="Style_Support_+_Left___0_5_" >Changing the PO Id in an existing transaction was resulting in erroneous postings.&nbsp; To prevent this, the new procedure will be to delete the erroneous entry and start a new one for the correct PO Id. If a check has already been cut, it must be voided before the entry can be deleted. </P>
 <P class="support" >1081&nbsp;Dispatch Board references incorrect method name</P>
 <P class="Style_Support_+_Left___0_5_" >Notice in error log review – not reported by customer. See case for details.</P>

 <P class="Style_Support_+_Left___0_5_" >Corrects problem where documents pointing URLs (http, https, www) didn't successfully launch when the user's default browser was Firefox.</P>
 <P class="support" >1053&nbsp;AP Journal viewer</P>
 <P class="Style_Support_+_Left___0_5_" >If a second Manual AP Check is created immediately following the first check, then the second check's chcklst.chcklst_rfrnce_rn entry refers back to the first check's vndrinvce_rn.</P>
 <P class="support" >1065&nbsp;Employee viewer – SSN range added to filter view for easy lookup</P>
 <P class="support" >1050&nbsp;Field class enhancements (internal) - see case for details</P>
 <P class="support" >Build 61</P>
 <P class="support" >543&nbsp;Implement trx date/time stamping on history entries</P>
 <P class="support" >Extends to Job Invoice and Reverse. See this case and case 1031 for details.  </P>
 <P class="support" style="margin-top:0;margin-bottom:0">  1045&nbsp;Data Import Utility&nbsp;</P>
 <P class="Style_Support_+_Left___0_5_" >In previous releases, the file import utility reads in the entire input file before performing the import. For large imports, this could result in the exceeding of the Smalltalk memory limits. This process has been revised to avoid this problem. See case for more details.</P>
 <P class="Style_Support_+_Left___0_5_" >8/24/2006 – corrects error where the input file was not being properly closed when the import was aborted because of a fatal error or because the error limit was exceeded. </P>
 <P class="support" >1041&nbsp;Data Import Utility</P>
 <P class="Style_Support_+_Left___0_5_" >The following changes have been made to the Data Import Utility:</P>
 <P class="support" >Do not treat a bad date (e.g. 06/31/2006) as a fatal error. Instead, issue a warning and set the date to the empty value.</P>
 <P class="support" >Expand the maximum width of a line on the log from 100 characters to 1000 characters.</P>
 <P class="support" >Some errors marked FATAL may not actually cause an abort and rollback. Fix this. Also, indicate at the end of the report if any FATAL errors were encountered.</P>
 <P class="support" >517&nbsp;History Posting </P>
 <P class="Style_Support_+_Left___0_5_" >Corrects some/all extraneous WO reversals. Should also fix record lock bug. See case for detail.</P>
 <P class="support" >1039&nbsp;Saved Report Ranges handle single quotes correctly</P>
 <P class="Style_Support_+_Left___0_5_" >In previous builds, problems could occur if you entered and saved a report range that included a quote mark (e.g. sql=(jb_id like '1%')). When the range was later recalled, each single quote has been replaced by two single quotes. (e.g. sql=(jb_id like ''1%'')).</P>
 <P class="support" >982&nbsp;ReportAnywhere now supports user’s branch graphics defined in report registry settings</P>
 <P class="support" >1035&nbsp;Purchase Order viewer</P>
 <P class="Style_Support_+_Left___0_5_" >Changes to the PO parent Job Id are now prevented once the PO has either IRJ receipts or AP Journal transactions recorded. </P>
 <P class="support" >Build 60</P>
 <P class="support" >Sporadic Stack Overflow Error</P>
 <P class="support" >This problem has hopefully been corrected with this build.</P>

 <P class="support" >1013&nbsp;View Inventory Stock Status</P>
 <P class="Style_Support_+_Left___0_5_" >Corrects a problem where right-clicking an item on the list view displayed the last item on the stock status list. The selected item now appears.</P>
 <P class="support" >1003&nbsp;Employee Viewer - SS # removed from view list indices for security reasons. </P>
 <P class="support" >968&nbsp;TechFinder – registry setting </P>
 <P class="Style_Support_+_Left___0_5_" >If additions to the tech status or escalation status are needed (for example, if you use the pending status) there is a Registry Override in that lets you do so.  See section 2.31 of the 6.1 Customer Release Notes for details. </P>
 <P class="support" >980&nbsp;Purchase Order Viewer - Field Removed: Sales Tax Group</P>
 <P class="Style_Support_+_Left___0_5_" >In previous releases, this field defaulted from the Vendor record. It is<FONT style="font-weight:bold; " > </FONT>not currently used by the software and has been removed as obsolete.  Note that the Sales Tax Group in the PO lines is set from the Job record (if specified) as in previous releases. </P>
 <P class="support" >968&nbsp;TechFinder Viewer</P>
 <P class="Style_Support_+_Left___0_5_" >In previous releases, the TechFinder Scheduled Hours grid included hours for work orders lines that were set to the following statuses:  On Break, onsite, scheduled, travel, unacknowledged, waiting service, waiting quote.  We added ‘completed’ with this case. Work Orders with an Escalation Status and Status Category of ‘completed’ are also included as of this mod.  </P>
 <P class="support" >975&nbsp;Vendor Viewer – Sales Tax Group field removed</P>
 <P class="Style_Support_+_Left___0_5_" >The sales tax group field was originally added to the Vendor record to support some anticipated custom work that didn’t pan out.  This field is not currently used by the software as is being removed as obsolete.  </P>
 <P class="support" >891&nbsp;Purchase Order Viewer</P>
 <P class="Style_Support_+_Left___0_5_" >The Inventory tab's Job Qty cannot be set to zero if the line contains either a WO Id or a Job Id. This was implemented to prevent a problem where PO costs (and a Job Quantity of 0) were imported into Work Orders. If the Job Qty is zero, then the costs should not be associated with the WO/Job at all.</P>
 <P class="support" >927&nbsp;Classic Dispatch Board locking users</P>
 <P class="Style_Support_+_Left___0_5_" >Corrects a problem where drag-and-drop WO reassignment from Classic Board was leaving wrkordrtchncn rows with uncommitted SQL updates related to re-sequencing the calls.</P>
 <P class="support" >Previously Undocumented Feature</P>
 <P class="support" >~&nbsp;(Global Not)</P>
 <P class="Style_Support_+_Left___0_5_" >The tilde (~) is a NOT operator. When the first character is a ~ the rest of the filter indicates which to exclude.  For example, <FONT style="font-weight:bold; " >~a,p,m</FONT> will include all values except a, p or m. This operator allows for more flexibility than ! or &lt;&gt;.</P>

 <P class="support" >899&nbsp;Client Site Viewer</P>
 <P class="Style_Support_+_Left___0_5_" >Corrects ‘record not found’ error on ClientSitesByClientSiteAlpha sort when Days field of record selected contained a dollar sign. </P>
 <P class="support" >901&nbsp;WO’s can be set to Invoice Ready with Open PO Lines <FONT style="font-weight:bold; " >(change to default behavior!)</FONT></P>
 <P class="Style_Support_+_Left___0_5_" >In version 6.1.358.055 the system would allow you to bill Work Orders using Service Invoicing when the Work Order had open purchase orders attached to the Work Order.&nbsp; In order to do this you had to manually check the Ready to Invoice button within the Work Order instead of using the OK to Invoice (thumbs up icon).&nbsp; This version of the software didn’t restrict the billing process when purchase orders were ‘open’.&nbsp; Version 6.1.358.056 and up does restrict the billing of any Work Order if there are attached ‘open’ purchase orders regardless if you manually check this box of use the Thumbs up Icon.</P>
 <P class="Style_Support_+_Left___0_5_" >Since some customers wish to bill even if a PO is open, the default behavior of the system has been effectively changed to allow Invoice Ready with open POs.&nbsp; The user will get a warning stating that open POs do exist for the WO.&nbsp; The new default behavior can be overridden by registry entry as follows...<BR><BR>Id:&nbsp; sys-viewer-vwrkordr<BR>Contents:&nbsp; OkToBillWithOpenPOs=false</P>

This was obsoleted by the Service Compute functionality. However, the ‘New Job for Each WO?’ may still be set in the Client Site record (though it is no longer displayed on the screen).

 <P class="support" >When a system is upgraded, the existing splash bitmap (v.bmp) will be copied to a version with the date included in the filename (_yyyymmdd.bmp).  If present, startme.exe will reference this bitmap instead of v.bmp.  To have a new splash screen appear, delete the v – dated bitmaps and replace the existing v.bmp bitmap with the new splash screen.

 <P class="support" >The new startme.exe files distributed with versions 6.1.358.025 and 6.2.378.beta_0610 (and later) support a new logging feature that enables our support representatives to monitor the time it takes to execute the various phases of the login process.&nbsp; Monitoring could be implemented if, for example, logon’s seemed to be taking an unreasonably long time for one or more users at a client’s site. </P>
 <P class="support" >To implement this option (with an appropriate version of the startme.exe file), you must include a new command line option. To do so,  change the startme shortcut to read:</P>

 <P class="support" >InventoryDescription=invntryitm.id </P>
 <P class="support" >This new option was implemented to enable a client’s service invoice to display inventory item id instead of the description.  Contact Brian to determine if this option is supported by your clients invoice option. </P>
 <P class="support" >(Note: also see note 2.7 for an example of Work Order Filtering). </P>
 <P class="support" >ImportPOs=false</P>
 <P class="support" >This restricts the Cost Import to entries accumulated from JCH. </P>
 <P class="support" >When using the Sub-Contractor tab on PO's &amp; Service Workorders --- setting this option will then prevent the system from importing costs from the PO's subcontract and from the AP invoice twice, it will then only import cost/revenue from AP (based on % earned on PO).&nbsp;&nbsp; </P>
 <P class="support" >When this registry setting is setup, it will also prevent CREDIT PO's from importing into the workorder.<BR>On CREDIT PO's if this registry setting is setup, then only the AP Voucher/Invoice (source AP Journal) will import into the workorder, without the setting, then credit PO's import twice into the workorder causing double costing.&nbsp;&nbsp; It seems this registry option may control &quot;un-received&quot; PO's as both CREDIT PO's and SUB-CONTRACT items appear in JCH as the source 'purchase'.</P>
 <P class="Support_Heading_2" >Deprecated Options:</P>
 <P class="support" >INVfromJCHAllowAdditionalEdits=true<BR>OTHfromJCHAllowAdditionalEdits=true<BR>LABfromJCHAllowAdditionalEdits=true&nbsp; &nbsp;</P>

 <P class="support" >In version 6.1, we tightened down edits to cost code, cost cat for lines that are imported to W.O. from P.O.'s...this was done because decisions relevant to G/L regarding entities, accounts, etc. would already have been posted from the AP Journal...therefore edits to these values should be prohibited or you won't have way to be confident that what happened in GL is consistent with how the final w.o. ended up.&nbsp; A customer insisted on having the ability to change these values, regardless of the consequences, so we enabled this (undesirable) functionality for them via registry.</P>
 <P class="Support_Heading_2" >2.2 Quotemaster Recap Report Substitution with sys-function-substitutions</P>
 <P class="support" >The Quotemaster &quot;View Recap&quot; button is hard-coded to the function &quot;rqtercp&quot;. If a different Recap report is to be used it should be entered into the Registry entry sys-function-substitutions as follows:</P>
 <P class="Style_Support_+_Left___0_5_" >rqtercp=rqtercp1</P>

 <P class="support" >The system now ignores bitmap registry entries with invalid paths instead of generating an error message.</P>
 <P class="Support_Heading_2" >2.4  Registry Entry to Control Type Ahead in Id Fields sys-id-autofill</P>
 <P class="Support_Heading_2" >Purpose:</P>
 <P class="support" >This registry entry enables the default type-ahead (also known as Autosearch) behavior to be altered on a table-by-table basis. </P>
 <P class="support" >Background</P>
 <P class="support" >In previous releases, Type Ahead was enabled in most Id fields:  you would start entering the Id, and the system would complete it for you as soon as it located a ‘match’.  However, due to performance issues, this functionality was disabled for the job, client, and client site within the image itself.  This hard-coding of type-ahead meant that it could not easily be tuned to specific user implementations. </P>
 <P class="support" >Changes in this Release</P>
 <P class="support" >In the absence of this registry entry, versions 6.1.358 and up observe the following default behavior:</P>
 <P class="support" >No Type Ahead By Default:</P>
 <P class="Style_Support_+_Left___0_5_" >Numeric Id’s generated by the system, including Journal Id’s, PO’s, Work Orders, Client Orders, Quotes. In these cases, type ahead does not gain the user anything because the id is most likely not defined until the last digit is typed in. </P>

 <P class="support" >Client 1598 has a registry setting for the AP Journal (UseVendorInvoiceViewer=true) that alters SAMPRO behavior to fit their processes.&nbsp; This entry indicates that vendor invoices are entered manually in the Vendor Invoice viewer prior to recording them in the AP Journal.&nbsp; This was done as a mod for them in October 2004.<BR><BR>This case (387) extends that methodology to include the Work Order viewer.&nbsp; The Import Costs process tests for vendor invoices that have been recorded in the Vendor Invoice viewer but not in the AP Journal.&nbsp; When this situation is detected, a warning message is appended to the old message...the one that summarizes the import.<BR><BR>The WO Import Costs process has NOT been changed for anyone not implementing the special registry entry as noted above.</P>

 <P class="support" ><FONT style="font-weight:bold; " >Ok to Bill?<BR></FONT>The meaning of ‘OK to Bill’ has been refined with release 6.1.

 <P class="Support_Heading_2" >5.1 Integration of Web Front-End Sign On with Extranets</P>
 <P class="Support_Heading_2" >Purpose:</P>
 <P class="support" >This enhancement implements a web front-end mechanism to enable the users of extranets (who are logged into the extranet) to transition smoothly to parts of Sampro's CRM/CSR web interface without having to log in again. </P>
 <P class="support" >This feature extends the Login web RPC to allow extranet users to pass on a pre-generated Session ID string (and a timeout length), along with the username and password (for authentication by SAM Pro). The idea is that when external users log into their extranet and receive a session id, they can also log that session id with SAM Pro, so it can be used at any time during their browsing session.</P>
 <P class="Support_Heading_2" >Usage:</P>
 <P class="support" >An external application (within the customer’s extranet) must be able to generate a valid session number and call to SAM Pro’s web front-end using a regular web request (http GET) to the address:</P>
 <P style="margin-top:0.00pt;"><FONT style="color:blue; text-decoration:underline;" >http://domain:port/action?rpc=registerSession&amp;session=[session-id]&amp;user=[username]&amp;password=[password]&amp;timeout=[number_of_seconds]</FONT></P>
 <P class="Support_Heading_2" >Parameters:</P>
 <P class="support" >[session-id]&nbsp; -- (Required) an alphanumeric session id, generated by the external application. <BR>[username]&nbsp; &nbsp; -- (Required) a valid Sam Pro web user (either a technician with 'client' or 'csr' web access, or the new style Web User (version 6.2 only)<BR>[password] -- (Required) a valid password for the user, plain text (either from the technician record with 'client' or 'csr' web access, or the new style Web User (version 6.2 only)).<BR>[number of seconds]&nbsp; -- (Optional, defaults to 10000 if not present) session timeout period, in seconds.</P>
 <P class="support" >Note that the external application must be able to generate the session id.  The extranet log in and the SAM Pro web logins should be identical. </P>
 <P class="Support_Heading_2" >Login In Results:</P>
 <P class="Style_Support_+_Left___0_5_" >If the username, password or session id is missing, an HTTP</P>
 <P class="support" >400 Bad Request<BR>status code is returned, along with an explanation for the error, in the http body.</P>
 <P class="Style_Support_+_Left___0_5_" >If the username or password is invalid, disabled or expired, an HTTP</P>
 <P class="support" >403 Forbidden<BR>status code is returned, along with an explanation in the http body.</P>
 <P class="Style_Support_+_Left___0_5_" >If neither of the previous results is returned, the 'registerSession' rpc method then registers the session with the web server (and creates the necessary temporary tables, for technician users). <BR></P>
 <P class="Style_Support_+_Left___0_5_" >If the operation is successful, an HTTP</P>
 <P class="support" >200 OK<BR>status code is returned.</P>
 <P class="Support_Heading_2" >Accessing the SAM Pro Web Interface After Log In:</P>
 <P class="support" >The Sam Pro web interface can now be accessed at any time (within the timeout period) by the external application by, linking to any valid rpc action. </P>
 <P style="margin-top:0.00pt;"><FONT style="color:maroon; font-weight:bold; text-decoration:underline;" >Example: To link to the Main menu:</FONT><FONT style="color:maroon; text-decoration:underline;" ><BR></FONT><FONT style="color:maroon; " ><BR></FONT><FONT style="font-family:'Tahoma'; color:#cc0000; " >http://domain:port/action?rpc=main&amp;session=[session-id]</FONT><FONT style="color:maroon; " ><BR><BR>(the session id has to be one that was previously registered).</FONT></P>
 <P class="Support_Heading_2" >Logging Off / Ending the SAM Pro Session:</P>
 <P class="support" >The external program can either let the session time out (at which point it's removed), or<BR>can call the logout rpc when the user exits the extranet:</P>
 <P style="margin-top:0.00pt;"><FONT style="color:blue; text-decoration:underline;" >http://domain:port/action?rpc=logout&amp;session=[session-id</FONT><FONT style="color:#cc0000; " >]</FONT></P>
