 <P class="support" ><FONT style="text-decoration:underline;" >2049</FONT>&nbsp;Work Order viewer – Deleting Inventory Lines if Accounting Period is Inactive</P>
 <P class="Style_Support_+_Left___0_5_" >In previous releases, although the user had to change the Accounting Period Id to an active one before deleting a WO Inventory line, the system posted the reversal to the Inactive period. To prevent this, the code has been changed as follows:</P>
 <P class="Style_Support_+_Left___0_5_" >1. The software saves the Accounting Period's status for each line on the INV tab as the WO is loaded into the viewer.&nbsp; You can see the results of this evaluation on the INV full screen view.&nbsp; It appears as a Boolean field labeled 'Closed Period Entry?'.<BR><BR>2. The existing validation rules already prevented nearly all changes to lines that referenced closed periods.&nbsp; One field you can change is the Accounting Period.&nbsp; That allows you to switch to an active period.&nbsp; When you do this, a screen prompt advises you that you're changing a line from a closed period.&nbsp; It's similar to the message that occurs in the more traditional journals when you edit a transaction from a closed period.<BR><BR>3. Existing validation rules prevent deletion of lines with closed periods.&nbsp; However, if the user changes to an active period, the deletion is permitted.&nbsp; This scenario was what permitted the user to generate a reversing entry into the closed period for the deleted line.&nbsp;The validation has been changed to include a test of the 'Closed Period Entry?' field.&nbsp; When this field is True, an error is reported the asme as when the line's current Accounting Period is closed.<BR><BR>4. The appropriate process for 'deleting' with closed period lines is to:</P>
 <P class="support" >a) Switch to an active period and zero out the quantity.&nbsp; </P>
 <P class="support" >b) Saving the WO with an active period.</P>
 <P class="support" >c) Delete the line and re-save the record.&nbsp;</P>
 <P class="Style_Support_+_Left___0_5_" >5. When posting occurs, the reversing entries will use the new period and effective dates.&nbsp; This applies to any line with 'Closed Accounting Period?' set to True.</P>

 <P class="Style_Support_+_Left___0_5_" >This case addresses a problem where an employee had WC withheld for a pay period that nothing but Vacation Pay.&nbsp; Vacation Pay is not subject to employer WC so it should also be exempt from employee WC.</P>
 <P class="support" >NOTE FROM JOE:</P>
 <P class="Style_Support_+_Left___0_5_" >I believe I corrected the problem that Auburn reported.&nbsp; However, in doing so I discovered a potential short-coming of the original 'WC Recovery' work done in case 650. Their issue was easy because it involved an all-or-nothing decision by Pay Type.&nbsp; The more complicated case is one where a Pay Type listed on the WC Category's child tab has a Rate Factor (RF) other than 0 or 1.<BR><BR>Consider this example...<BR>Workers Comp is defined as 4% of straight-time wages and .5% can be recovered from employees.&nbsp; The WC Category child tab would have lines for all relevant Pay Types ... Reg, OT, DT, etc.&nbsp; The OT and DT lines would have RFs less than 1.0 so as to factor out the premium pay.<BR><BR>The problem is one of timing.&nbsp; At the time the WC Recovery deduction is computed, the RFs have NOT been evaluated to decide between regular pay and exempt premium pay.&nbsp; Without considerable effort I can't make this issue go away.&nbsp; So, if we can make Auburn happy with the new code we're going to live with this limitation until someone really forces the issue to get resolved.</P>

 <P class="support" ><FONT style="text-decoration:underline;" >1986</FONT>&nbsp;Service Compute with tax type of n/a – RSD</P>
 <P class="Style_Support_+_Left___0_5_" >In recent releases, the service compute didn’t look at the tax type id on the individual line, instead it solely went off of the cost category’s cost type and the taxable boxes in the sales tax group; the work done in case 695 was responsible for this behavior.  Part of this case was the implementation of separate taxing rules for the individual authorities that become part of a Sales Tax Group.&nbsp; With the rules potentially defined at the Authority level, the tax calculations became more dependent on Cost Categories than the Tax Type specified on individual JCH entries.&nbsp; In effect, a Cost Category could be taxable for one authority but not for others within the same Sales Tax Group.</P>
 <P class="Style_Support_+_Left___0_5_" >The previous code executed a very simple SQL statement that queries and accumulates the JCH Revenue by Cost Category with NO regard to Tax Type Ids.&nbsp; The results of the query are then passed to the tax calculator.&nbsp; The tax calculator processes the SQL results and sends back the accumulated Tax Base and Tax Amount broken out by Cost Category.&nbsp;This has been causing problems with flat rate pricing, since the flat rate is typically divided in to taxable and non-taxable portions, but one cost category. </P>
 <P class="Style_Support_+_Left___0_5_" >In this release, the SQL has been changed to ignore JCH entries where the Tax Type Id equals 'n/a'.&nbsp; This change needs to be thoroughly tested to see if there are any unintended side effects to this change. </P>

 <P class="support" >858&nbsp;Disallow Multiple Tech Lines for Same Tech/Date/WO</P>
 <P class="Style_Support_+_Left___0_5_" >The dispatch board does not deal with multiple lines for the same wo/date/tech in the most consistent/elegant manner.&nbsp; The powerboard/workorder list groups by tech/date/wo so only a single line will appear for a tech for a wo for a particular date. By contrast, in the Classic Board, multiple cells will appear for the same wo/tech/date. However, when you attempt to reschedule one of the dispatches in classic by dragging and dropping the cell, both cells move to the new tech. </P>
 <P class="Style_Support_+_Left___0_5_" >A unique key has been added to the wrkordrtchncn table definition that requires that each combination of wrkordr_rn + tchncn_rn + wrkordrtchncn_dte_schdld be unique.&nbsp; This effectively prevents the situation described above.&nbsp; However...</P>
 <P class="support" >- The index won't exist until you execute the next v6.3 data conversion or the MS Access Update.</P>
 <P class="support" >- The index can't be created in a database that already violates the uniqueness constraint.<BR><BR>Basically, we'll have to deal with installations on an as-needed basis if their data violates this constraint.&nbsp; This is certainly true for any installation that intends to run TechAnyhere.</P>

 <P class="support" >814&nbsp;Cash Requirements Report – Vendor Qualification</P>
 <P class="Style_Support_+_Left___0_5_" >When a vendor's entire outstanding balance is &quot;retainage&quot; the vendor and invoices do not qualify for inclusion on the report.&nbsp; Retainage only invoices did appear if ANY invoice for the vendors had a non-retainage outstanding balance – this problem has been corrected.</P>
 <P class="support" >599 &nbsp;Manual AP Check Void Warning</P>
 <P class="Style_Support_+_Left___0_5_" >The solution provided by case 586 (activate Undo for AP and GL journals) provides the ability to appropriately VOID or edit Manual Check AP Transactions. However, the opportunity to create an undesirable scenario still exists, because START VOID CHECK and START VOID AP CHECK do not prevent manual checks from being voided which will in effect orphan the expense/liability created in the MANUAL CHECK AP Trx.<BR><BR>The software now includes a test for Manual Checks, and displays a message to address Manual Check Voids in the source AP Journal Trx.</P>
