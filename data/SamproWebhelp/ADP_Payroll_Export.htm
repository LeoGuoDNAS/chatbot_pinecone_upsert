<h1>ADP Payroll Export</h1>
<p>This report generates a .csv file that will be provided to the payroll service ADP.</p>
<h2>Usage:</h2>
<p>ADP Payroll Export runs off Payroll files (Compute PR must be run!).</p>
<p>ADP must be notified that all hours will be handled as straight hours. No markups should be applied by ADP.</p>
<p>Salaried employees will be passed to ADP with hours and effective pay rates from Data-Basics.</p>
<p><font style="font-weight: bold;">Note:</font> this version of the interface assumes that ADP handles tax and departmental information in their employee master record. Multi-jurisdictional taxation is not currently handled. Similarly, GL Entities will be assigned according to the employee’s home department from the ADP employee master record.</p>
<p>A new alternative to this version of the export is supported by <a href="Report_PR_Export_(ADP).htm">Report PR Export (ADP).</a> Be sure to consult with your support representative before switching functions.</p>
