<h1>Work Code Viewer</h1>
<h2>Purpose:</h2>
<p>Create, maintain and select from your list of Work Codes. Work Codes 
 concisely identify the service call or PM that is being handled on the 
 Work Order.</p>
<h2>Example:</h2>
<p>Depending upon the needs of your company, your Work Codes can be very 
 simple (e.g., noheat, nocool, pm, etc.). Alternately, a more comprehensive 
 set of Work Codes can refer to origin of the problem.</p>
<h2>Usage:</h2>
<p>Recommended for Dispatching and Work Orders.</p>
<p>Referenced in Records: Work Order, Client Site Equipment PM Schedule.</p>
<p>Supports Cycle Code Filtering of Work Order Metrics (Log Form) lines. 
 See <a href="Log_Form_Viewer.htm">Log Form Viewer</a> for additional details.</p>
<h2>Related Registry:</h2>

 to add Work Code Certifications to TechFinder</a></p>
<h2>Important Fields:</h2>
<p><font style="font-weight: bold;">Note:</font> this Help Topic lists 
 the standard configuration of all fields that may be included in this 
 record. If you are using a customized system, the fields displayed on 
 your screen may not exactly match the order or status (required, optional, 
 default, display-only, hidden, etc.) of the fields described in this Topic.</p>
<p><font style="font-weight: bold;">Work Code Id:</font> (15 character, 
 only . and - special characters)<br/>
Uniquely identifies this Work Code. This field is required.</p>
<p><font style="font-weight: bold;">Work Code Name:</font> (40 character)<br/>
The optional field may be used to enter a brief description of the problem. 
 The system now sets the Work Order Name from the Work Code Name when generating 
 PM Work Orders. In New Call, the Work Code Name will be used for the Work 
 Order Name if this field is not completed by the user.</p>
<p><font style="font-weight: bold;">Estimated Hours:</font> (numeric format 
 000.00)<br/>
This optional field enables you to enter the estimated number of hours 
 required to resolve this problem. The estimated hours on a Service Work 
 Order default from this field (the Service Task record provides the default 
 estimated hours for a PM Work Order).</p>
<p><font style="font-weight: bold;">Priority:</font> (numeric 0-9)<br/>
This field is used to set the default priority of a Work Order when it 
 is first created. By definition, a priority of 0 is the highest (most 
 critical) priority.</p>
<p><font style="font-weight: bold;">Web Access: Allowed?<br/>
</font>Check this box (by double clicking on it) if you want it to appear 
 on the FMAnywhere / Client Web New Call page. This box should remain blank 
 if you do not want your client to be able to select this work code.</p>
<p><font style="font-weight: bold;">Work Code Description:</font><br/>
A more complete description of this problem or additional information you 
 wish to include. In New Call, this field will be use to provide the Work 
 Requested.</p>
<p><font style="font-weight: bold;">Call Script Id:<br/>
</font>This field enables you to assign a Call Script to a specific work 
 code (as well as to Equipment) for use in conjunction with New Call and 
 FMAnywhere / Client Web Portal .</p>
<p class="Reference_Line" style="margin-bottom: 0.00pt;">When you select 
 a Work Code with an assigned Call Script in New Call, the system will 
 immediately prompt you to respond to the Call Script questions. If you 
 select a Client Site Equipment record (in New Call) that also references 
 a Call Script, you will be prompted to answer those questions as well. 
 In this case, both sets of Call Script questions and replies will be recorded 
 in the Call Script tab of the Work Order.</p>
<p class="Reference_Line" style="margin-bottom: 0.00pt;">If this Work Code 
 flagged for Web Access (see the Web Access: Allowed? field), the questions 
 included in this Call Script will be displayed in when a customer selects 
 this Work Code.</p>
<p><font style="font-weight: bold;">Service Category<br/>
</font>This field promotes ease of use in the New Call viewer and Client 
 Web interface. It categorizes the types of equipment that your firm works 
 on in way that is easy and obvious for your customers to understand. If 
 you enter a Service Category in New Call, the pop-up work code list will 
 be filtered to only those referencing the corresponding Service Category. 
 It is also used in the Client Web Interface to filter the types of service 
 that a customer may request.</p>
<p><font style="font-weight: bold;">Cycle Code Filter:</font><font style="font-weight: bold;"><br/>
</font>This filter is used by Sam Pro and TechAnywhere to filter the Work 
 Order Log Form Metrics written to the Work Order. Note that Log Form Id 
 field in the Client Site Equipment record determines which Log Form (list 
 of metrics) is used. Multiple cycle codes may be entered as a comma-delimited 
 alphanumeric list. In the case of letters, this field is not case sensitive 
 (a=A).</p>
<p>If this field is blank, all metrics from the Log Form will be written 
 to the Metrics tab.</p>
<p>If one or more Cycle Codes are listed, only those Log Form (metrics) 
 lines whose CC: field corresponds to the filter or is blank will be written 
 to the Work Order (for Techs without remote access) or uploaded to the 
 Technician’s device.</p>
<p>The Work Code in the Work Order header is used for metrics filtering 
 purposes for Service Work Orders.</p>
<p>For PM Work Orders, the Cycle Code Filter (if completed) in the PM Schedule 
 Tab of the Client Site Equipment, or the Schedule Tab of the Master Contract 
 will override the Work Code’s Cycle Code Filter.</p>
<p style="margin-left: 36.00pt;"><font style="text-decoration: underline; ">Example:</font> 
 Cycle Code Filter: 1,3</p>
<p style="margin-left: 36.00pt;">Only those lines from the Log Form whose 
 CC field is set to 1, to 3 or is blank would be written to the Work Order 
 or uploaded to the Technician’s device.</p>
<p><font style="font-weight: bold;">Work Code User1-5</font><br/>
These fields may be used to record additional information required by your 
 company.</p>
<p><span><a href="Registry_Entry_Global_Settings__Column_Compression__Dispatch_Board_Rows__History_Log_Inventory_Markup.htm#Work_Code_Certifications_for_Techfinder">Registry 
 to add Work Code Certifications to TechFinder</a> </span><span>allows 
 the use of the Work Code User1 field to specify additional Certifications.</span></p>
<p><font style="font-weight: bold;">Obsolete</font><font style="font-weight: bold;">?</font><font style="font-weight: bold;"><br/>
</font>If this field is checked, the record is considered Obsolete, and 
 it may not be directly specified during data-entry (either by entering 
 the Id or selecting it from a list). Obsoleted records can be edited and 
 the Obsolete option can be un-done when necessary. When you check the 
 Obsolete field, the following message box will be displayed:</p>
<p style="margin-left: 36.00pt;">“You have elected to obsolete this record. 
 Would you like to see existing references to this record?”</p>
<p>If you click Yes, the system will display a viewer that provides click-through 
 access to all tables referencing this record: see <a href="References_List.htm">References 
 List</a> for details.</p>
<p><font style="font-weight: bold;">Security Id:</font><br/>
If multiple location security is implemented on your centralized database 
 system, this informational field displays the Security Id of the local 
 user that created this record. If multiple location security is not implemented 
 on your system, or if this record was created by a global user, this field 
 will be blank.</p>
