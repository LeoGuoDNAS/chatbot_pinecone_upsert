  <h1>Job EOM (End of Month) Processing</h1>
  <h2>Purpose:</h2>
  <p>This function streamlines the process of recognizing revenue and making job WIP postings to GL.</p>
  <h5>User is Notified If Invoicing Is In Process</h5>
  <p>In version 9.1.611.058, the user is notified if anyone is invoicing work order or jobs when Job End of Month has started:</p>
  <p style="margin-left: 48px;">Invoices or Worksheets are currently being processed by another user. Cannot perform Job EOM processing.</p>
  <p style="margin-left: 8px;">A workspace message screen will then display the active invoicing details so that these other users can be alerted to complete their invoicing. The Job, Work Order, and User&#39;s Name are listed. If no actual User is on file, it will print out what was in the field. This message will supply the user with everything they or support needs to know to find &amp; clear the associated jchstry_rfrnce_ar_invce_id transactions if the # user info isn&#39;t valid.</p>
  <p style="margin-left: 48px;">The following Work Orders/Jobs are currently being Invoiced.<br/>
    Each has one or more JCH entries that are being locked by a user:</p>
  <p style="margin-left: 48px;">Job:   WO:   User:</p>
  <p style="margin-left: 8px;">Once the Jobs and Work Orders are no longer being processed for invoicing, Job End of Month can be run. Note that #userid may be retained in the jchstry_rfrnce_ar_invce_id if a user exits while in the process of running Compute Service Billing.</p>
  
  <p style="margin-left: 48px;"><span style="font-weight: bold;">IMPORTANT:</span><br/>
    Although this function is prevented from running if invoicing is in process when it is started, it is possible to invoice after this function has started. Invoicing should NOT be done for the month that you are closing while this function is running. Doing so may result in previously posted invoices appearing on a subsequent run.</p>
  <p class="Support" style="margin-left: 48px;"></p>
  <p>This function may be run multiple times in a month.  On iterative runs this function already knows what has already been posted for this month and will calculate the net when creating the GL posting line.</p>
  <p style="margin-left: 8px;"> </p>
  <p>Version 9.1.611.056 supports changes in precision of decimals to match DBAnalytics. This change supports the broader objective to make % Completion Revenue audit-able and consistent with DBA: Job Performance.</p>
  <h2>Registry:</h2>
  <p>See <a href="Internal_Registry_Entry_Job_EOM_Process.htm">Registry Job EOM Process (sys-job-eom)</a> .</p>
  <p>See <a href="Registry_Entry_Job_and_Job_Cloning.htm#Small_Jobs_Processing_Modification_to_use_Job_Date_Completed">Registry to Use Job Date Completed</a> for an alternate way of triggering the Job EOM processing for Small Jobs.</p>
  <h2>Usage:</h2>
  <p>Use this function in conjunction with Update Job Progress and Budgets. We strongly advise that you consult with your support representative on the optimal manner to use this function for your firm&#39;s particular setup.</p>
  <p>This function is in line with Expense Account posting from the WO Inventory tab. By default, the GL Expense account is set from the Inventory Group record. The Job Cost EOM also recognizes there might be a GL Income Account in the Cost Category and includes it in the computations. Job EOM writes the Work Order Reference RN to GL History to help users tie out financials to a Work Order.</p>
  <p>All billing items attached to service compute jobs are treated as T&amp;M, regardless of the Fixed Fee flag setting.</p>
  <p>Validation prevents Jobs with missing GL information from being posted. If you attempt to select or click the Go button when this situation exists, the system will display the error “Job (Job Id) has detail lines that are missing GL Accounts” and will not allow the post to proceed with the illegible lines flagged.</p>
  <p style="margin-left: 72.00pt;">
    <font style="font-weight: bold;">Hint:</font> The sys-job-eom registry entry or the cost category should be examined if this message is displayed.
  </p>
  <p>GL Account from Vendor: If Job Cost Categories do not specify a GL Expense account, the GL account will be pulled from the Vendor.  Note that Inventory is a special case where the Expense Account might come from the Inventory Group depending on registry settings and other conditions.  Otherwise, the normal progression for all cost types is (1) Cost Category; (2) Cost Code: (3) &#39;glcos&#39; registry setting; (4) the Vendor record; (5) nothing.</p>
  <p>Billing Items that haven&#39;t been billed require EOM Under-billed Revenue Adjustments.  These adjustments should be as smart as the compute GL computations used in the Record Billing Adjustments function.  The system allocates the Earned Revenue (under-billed) across relevant Cost Codes by (a) Contract Amount Invoiced, or (b) Budget Revenue, or (c) Unbilled Costs, or (d) Projected Costs.</p>
  <h3><span style="font-weight: bold;">Use with Small Jobs:</span></h3>
  <p style="margin-left: 88px;"><span style="font-weight: bold;">Note:</span> See <a href="Registry_Entry_Job_and_Job_Cloning.htm#Small_Jobs_Processing_Modification_to_use_Job_Date_Completed">Registry to Use Job Date Completed</a> for an alternate way of triggering the Job EOM processing for Small Jobs using the Job Date Completed (required a customization file and registry to enable.</p>
  <p style="margin-left: 48px;">Costs and Revenues are not recognized on a Small Job until the Job Date Closed is set. If the Job&#39;s Contract Type is set to Small Job, Start Job EOM will automatically use a special WIP method that will accrue revenue and costs until the Job Date Closed field is manually set by a user. If costs and or revenues are found for an open Small Job (Job Date Closed is blank) they will be debited/credited in the current accounting period and automatically reversed in the next accounting period.</p>
  <p style="margin-left: 48px;">If the job is closed in the current EOM period (Job Date Closed not blank) the Start Job EOM will attempt to recognize any unbilled revenue for this job (Contract amount from billing items), reversing this transaction in the 1st day of the next accounting period.  When the job is billed complete no further Job EOM process takes place.</p>
  <p style="margin-left: 48px;"><span style="font-weight: bold;">Note:</span> DB Underbilling  - CR Income<br style="margin-bottom: 0px; color: #000000; font-family: Verdana, &#39;Helvetica Neue&#39;, Helvetica, Arial, sans-serif;

    The G/L accounts used for the posting are set via the sys-job-eom registry.</p>
  <h3>Change Requests</h3>
  <p>Open Job Billing Item Change Requests (CORs) are included in the EOM processing.  They are treated as Fixed Fee with the Contract Amount adjusted by Percent Likelihood. Change Requests will be processed by the EOM function if:</p>
  <p style="margin-left: 48px;">Date Approved &amp; Date Declined = 1900-01-01<br style="margin-bottom: 0px; color: #000000;

  <h2>Registry:</h2>
  <p class="Block_Text">A registry entry enables you to override the default behavior, and instead derive the GL Expense Account assignment from the Cost Category for both Job EOM and the WO Inventory tab. This registry entry (for sys-viewer-vwrkordr) is discussed in <a href="Registry_Entry_to_Warn_if_Cost_Code_Requires_Certified_PR_Reporting.htm">Registry Entry Work Order Options</a>.</p>
