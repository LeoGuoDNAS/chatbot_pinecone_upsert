 <P class="support" ><FONT style="text-decoration:underline;" >3262</FONT>&nbsp;PR Mods</P>
 <P class="support" >Overview</P>
 <P class="support" >The Time Entry Wizard allows labor that is being charged to a work order to be entered in a user-friendly start time and end time basis and have the system work out the details of regular, overtime and double-time labor and pay rates. When time is posted from the Wizard to the Work Order, the system automatically calculates straight time, time and a half (o/t) and double time for both pay and bill hours based on a shift definition defined in the Technician record and regular time billing period defined in the Work Order’s Job record. </P>
 <P class="support" >Setup:</P>
 <P class="support" >Job Record: </P>
 <P class="support" >Kaback Customization - New Fields on Job Invoicing Tab:</P>
 <P class="support" ><FONT style="font-weight:bold; " >Regular Billing Start Time: </FONT><FONT style="font-weight:bold; " ><BR></FONT><FONT style="font-weight:bold; " >Regular Billing End Time:</FONT><BR>These fields default what are considered to be regular hours for this job for week days that are not defined as holidays on the Kaback calendar. The Wizard will use the applicable Labor Rate (Regular, Overtime, Doubletime and Travel Regular, Overtime and Doubletime) on the Technician Defaults tab for Billing based on these hours.</P>
 <P class="support" ><FONT style="font-weight:bold; " >Saturday Included:<BR>Sunday Included:<BR></FONT>Checking these boxes enables Saturday and/or Sunday work to be defined as Regular Billing when determining the Labor Rate to use.</P>

 <P class="support" ><FONT style="font-weight:bold; " >Start Time:<BR></FONT><FONT style="font-weight:bold; " >Quit </FONT><FONT style="font-weight:bold; " >Time:<BR></FONT>These fields provide the shift information for regular time for this Technician. This in turn determines which Pay Type to use (Pay Type Id, Overtime, or Doubletime). </P>

 <P class="support" >New Fields on Technician Defaults Tab:<BR>&nbsp;Labor Rate Id’s for Travel Time:<BR>&nbsp;Regular:<BR>&nbsp;Overtime:<BR>&nbsp;Doubletime:</P>

 <P class="support" >Setting Key: date in yyyy-mm-dd</P>

 <P class="support" >Labor Rate Record:</P>
 <P class="support" >The Job Cost Category field should be completed for Labor Rates used for Technician Time Entry.</P>

 <P class="support" >The Technician Time Entry Wizard:</P>
 <P class="support" ><IMG src="images/entertime.gif" align=left border=0 height=28 width=48 alt="images\entertime.gif"> The Technician Time Entry Wizard launched by clicking the Enter Time button on the Work Order’s Main tab (requires a special v.cus file).

 <P class="support" ><FONT style="font-weight:bold; " >Shift Override?</FONT><BR>Check this box (by double-clicking or pressing the Spacebar when the caret is on it) if the work or travel time you entered should be handled as Regular Time (work or travel), regardless of the Start and End Times that are set in the Job record. </P>

 <P class="support" >When above information is entered in the wizard, the system will calculate regular, overtime and double time pay and bill hours based the following rules and write to the Labor tab of the work order:</P>
 <P class="support" >Any hours worked before the Technician Start Time or after the Technician End Time defined in the Technician record will be considered overtime pay and default the calculated hours and Technician Overtime Pay Type Id found in the Technician record and other entered information to the Labor entry screen on the Work Order.</P>
 <P class="support" >Any hours worked before the Regular Billing Start Time or after the Regular Billing End Time found in the Job referenced in the Work Order will be considered overtime billing and default the calculated hours and the Technician Overtime Labor Rate Id found in the Technician record along with other entered information to the Labor entry screen on the Work Order.</P>
 <P class="support" >If any of the hours worked are on Saturday, they will be considered overtime pay and overtime bill unless the referenced Job has the &quot;Saturday Included&quot; box checked which will then calculate overtime pay but regular time bill if hours are within Reg. Billing Start/End times defined in Job record. If any of the hours worked are on Sunday, they will be considered overtime pay and overtime bill unless the referenced Job has the &quot;Sunday Included&quot; box checked which will then calculate overtime pay but regular time bill if hours are within Reg. Billing Start/End times defined in the Job record.</P>
 <P class="support" >If any of the hours worked are on a defined company holiday or a Sunday, they will be considered double time pay and double time bill hours.</P>
 <P class="support" >If Travel check box is marked, default the appropriate Travel Labor Rate Id from Technician Record.</P>
 <P class="support" >If Shift Override check box is marked, treat hours worked as regular time.</P>
