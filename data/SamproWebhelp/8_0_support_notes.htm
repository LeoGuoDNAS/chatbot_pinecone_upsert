 <P class="support" ><FONT style="font-weight:bold; " >Revised Reports</FONT></P>
 <P class="support" >4553<FONT style="font-weight:bold; " > &nbsp;</FONT>Report W2 Electronic File</P>
 <P class="support" style="margin-left:36.00pt;">The Audit Report option of Report W2 Electronic File (report RW2EF.rpt dated 2/21/2012) has been modified so that the totals row is offset so that larger payroll amounts do not overlap.  This change impacts the Audit option only. This report is suitable for version 7.2 and up.</P>
 <P class="support" style="margin-left:36.00pt;"><FONT style="font-weight:bold; " >CHANGE TO DEFAULT BEHAVIOR</FONT></P>
 <P class="support" style="margin-left:36.00pt;">In this version of the report, a registry entry is now required to set Position 174 on the RE line as the default has been changed to blank to accommodate special processing for the state of Maryland. The following option is now required for the federal process with this report. <FONT style="font-weight:bold; " >Id: sys-w2-ef</FONT></P>
 <P class="support" style="margin-left:36.00pt;"><FONT style="font-weight:bold; " >Setting Key:</FONT> reEmployerKind&nbsp; <FONT style="font-weight:bold; " >Setting Value:</FONT> F, S, T, Y or N (default is blank)</P>
 <P class="support" style="margin-left:36.00pt;">F – Federal Government</P>
 <P class="support" style="margin-left:36.00pt;">S- State and Local Government</P>
 <P class="support" style="margin-left:36.00pt;">T – Tax exempt Employer</P>
 <P class="support" style="margin-left:36.00pt;">Y – State and Local Tax Exempt Employer</P>
 <P class="support" style="margin-left:36.00pt;">N – None Apply – this is REQUIRED for files uploaded to the federal government.</P>
 <P class="support" >4568 &nbsp;Drill Down AP Aging</P>
 <P class="support" style="margin-left:36.00pt;">The updated report (DAPVAGEv73b033.rpt dated 2/28/2012) corrects a problem that only occurred if you ran the Drill Down AP Aging by Vendor report with the Invoice Detail option see to Yes. In earlier reports, this resulted in the associated drill-down (CAPVAGE2) displaying the correct vendor id but the incorrect vendor name. This report is suitable for version 7.3 and up.</P>
 <P class="support" style="margin-left:36.00pt;">Separate versions for the report with this fix are also available for versions 7.0 and 7.1, and 7.2. </P>
 <P class="support" ><FONT style="font-weight:bold; " >2012-03-07</FONT><FONT style="font-weight:bold; " > (jt)-version 8.0.509.010</FONT></P>
 <P class="support" ><FONT style="text-decoration:underline;" >2897</FONT>  &nbsp;Job Invoice GL (table changes)</P>
 <P class="support" >4029  &nbsp;Project Managers Workbench</P>
 <P class="support" >&nbsp;New Button: Create Quote</P>
 <P class="support" style="margin-left:36.00pt;">The Create Quote button launches the Quote viewer to allow Quotes to be generated for the selected Job. The Job/Site Id will be defaulted to the new Quote.  </P>
 <P class="support" style="margin-left:36.00pt;">New Tab: Quotes</P>
 <P class="support" style="margin-left:36.00pt;">This new tab displays the Quotes associated with the selected Job. A Quote will appear on this tab if the Job Id is completed in the Quote header. A Quote will also be displayed if it’s Job Id is blank but the Work Order Id is completed and references the selected Job. </P>
 <P class="support" style="margin-left:36.00pt;">The following Quote fields are displayed:</P>
 <P class="support" style="margin-left:36.00pt;">Quote Id - Description – DateOpened – Status </P>
 <P class="support" style="margin-left:36.00pt;">These fields default from the Quote header. </P>
 <P class="support" style="margin-left:36.00pt;">Equipment Id – Option – Bill Item Id – Bill Item Status – Price – Scope</P>
 <P class="support" style="margin-left:36.00pt;">These fields default from the Quote Scope tab.  Note that the Bill Item Id and the Bill Item Status are only completed if a Change Order Billing Item has been generated for the specified option. </P>
 <P class="support" >4509&nbsp;Document Scanning</P>
 <P class="support" style="margin-left:36.00pt;">When a file is scanned in SAM Pro, the document record must be added before the Show Document button will display the file.  If the user clicked the Show Document button before adding the record, the message “Document must be saved to be available to show”.  Since users found this confusing as the Save button was disabled, the message has been revised to read “Document must be added to be available to show.”</P>
 <P class="support" >4588  &nbsp;Dispatch Board</P>
 <P class="support" style="margin-left:36.00pt;"> In previous releases, the Description field on the Dispatch Board’s Work Order List defaulted from the Work Order Name.  In this enhancement, if the Work Order Name is blank, the first 40 characters of the Work Order Work Requested will be displayed in the Description. </P>
 <P class="support" style="margin-left:36.00pt;">In addition, the following registry option may be implemented to display the first 40 characters of the Work Order Work Requested in the Description first. If the Work Order Work Requested is blank, the Work Order name will be displayed instead. </P>
 <P class="support" style="margin-left:36.00pt;">&nbsp;Id: sys-viewer-vdsptchbrd<BR>Key: DescriptionFromWorkRequested<BR>Value: true (default false)</P>
 <P class="support" ><FONT style="text-decoration:underline;" >4093</FONT>  &nbsp;Job Budget Tab</P>
 <P class="support" style="margin-left:36.00pt;">Id: sys-viewer-vjb<BR>This registry option allows you to default the Effective Date that will be used when Budget entries are written to Job History from this tab. </P>
 <P class="support" style="margin-left:36.00pt;">Setting Key: BudgetEffectiveDate</P>
 <P class="support" style="margin-left:36.00pt;">Setting Value: &nbsp; none or currentdate or DateOpened (Default none)<BR>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; none - date from Job budget Effective date field<BR>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; currentdate - today’s date from system date<BR>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; DateOpened – date from Job’s Date Opened </P>
 <P class="support" style="margin-left:36.00pt;">Job Budget Tab</P>
 <P class="support" style="margin-left:36.00pt;">New Field (click Magnify button): Date Effective</P>
 <P class="support" style="margin-left:36.00pt;">This field will be used by the system when writing entries to Job History from this tab, unless overridden by the registry (see above). If the BudgetEffectiveDate job registry option is set to currentdate or DateOpened, the user will be warned and entry in this field will be denied. </P>
 <P class="support" ><FONT style="text-decoration:underline;" >4466</FONT>  &nbsp;Log Form viewer </P>
 <P class="support" style="margin-left:36.00pt;">Enhanced validation added for references to Log Form Lines when the user attempts to delete a line from the child table in the Log Form viewer.&nbsp; When the lgfrmlne_rn has references in wrkordrsystmmtrcs, the system will now popup a message box and deny the delete. In previous version, the ‘deleted’ line reappeared when the record was saved. </P>
 <P class="support" style="margin-left:36.00pt;">In addition, the user if warned if he or she changes the lgfrm.lne, lgfrm.hdr or lgfrm.unt-msre of a metric that exists in work order system metrics:</P>
 <P class="support" style="margin-left:36.00pt;">&quot;This field has been referenced in the work order metrics tab *** times. Any changes to this field should only be to correct typos or to clarify the test parameters - NOT to change the purpose of this metric.&quot;</P>
 <P class="support" > <FONT style="text-decoration:underline;" >4476</FONT>  &nbsp;Inventory Item</P>
 <P class="support" style="margin-left:36.00pt;">New Field: Obsolete</P>
 <P class="support" style="margin-left:36.00pt;">If the existing Inactive flag is checked, this item may not be entered on Purchase Orders, but may be entered on Work Orders and Client Orders (to use up existing stock). </P>
 <P class="support" style="margin-left:36.00pt;">If the new Obsolete flag is also checked, you may not enter this record on anything – Work Orders, Purchase Orders, Client Orders, Job Journal, etc. </P>
 <P class="support" style="margin-left:36.00pt;">This field effectively produces a 2-tier system for managing inventory. Inactive Items would be ones that you didn't want to purchase, but were still in stock. Once the item was depleted, it could be flagged as Obsolete so it could not be entered on anything.</P>
 <P class="support" style="margin-left:36.00pt;">The system will automatically set the Inactive flag when the user sets the Obsolete flag, but not the other way around. Clearing the Obsolete flag does not clear the Inactive flag. </P>
 <P class="support" style="margin-left:36.00pt;">An sql that support can run to set the Obsolete flag if Inactive is set at the customer's request is attached to this case.</P>
 <P class="support" > 4482  &nbsp;Viewers (general)--** add latest patch</P>
 <P class="support" style="margin-left:36.00pt;">Additional patch for IM reversals handling. The reversals dictionary for #imhstry should be empty but instead has an empty-type record in it.&nbsp; This causes code previously written for this case to crash when trying to determine the old trx id from the entry to be reversed.</P>
 <P class="support" ><FONT style="text-decoration:underline;" >4483</FONT>  &nbsp;Log Form Cycle Codes</P>
 <P class="support" style="margin-left:36.00pt;"><FONT style="font-weight:bold; " >Important Note</FONT><FONT style="font-weight:bold; " > on Metrics</FONT><FONT style="font-weight:bold; " >/Log Form Lines</FONT><FONT style="font-weight:bold; " >:</FONT> when a work order referencing a log form is created in SAM Pro, metrics (log form lines) will only be written to the Work Order Metrics tab if the Technician is not a TechAnywhere tech (e.g., Remote Access is set to None) or if no Tech is specified.  If it is initially assigned to a technician with remote access, metrics will be uploaded to the technician’s device, and then posted to the work order in SAM Pro when they have been completed in the field.  </P>
 <P class="support" style="margin-left:36.00pt;">Log Form Lines Viewer</P>
 <P class="support" style="margin-left:36.00pt;">CC: Cycle Code<BR>This field may be used to control which metrics are written to the Work Order Metrics tab when Service or PM Work Orders are generated. Note that Log Form field in the Client Site Equipment record determents which list of metrics is used.</P>
 <P class="support" style="margin-left:36.00pt;">When a Service Work Order is created in SAM Pro’s New Call, the system will check the Cycle Code Filter in the Work Code; if this field is completed, only those log form line metrics whose CC: field corresponds to the filter or is blank will be written to the Work Order (for Techs without remote access) or uploaded to the Technician’s device. </P>
 <P class="support" style="margin-left:36.00pt;">When a PM Work Order is created, the system will check the Cycle Code Filter in the Client Site Equipment PM Schedule. If the Cycle Code Filter in the schedule is blank, the system will use the Cycle Code Filter in the Work Code instead. Only those metrics whose CC: field corresponds to the filter or is blank will be written to the Work Order (for Techs without remote access) or uploaded to the Technician’s device. </P>
 <P class="support" style="margin-left:72.00pt;">Tip: If a log form metric should ALWAYS be recorded, leave the CC field blank.</P>
 <P class="support" style="margin-left:36.00pt;">Work Code Viewer:</P>
 <P class="support" style="margin-left:36.00pt;">New Field - Cycle Code Filter:</P>
 <P class="support" style="margin-left:36.00pt;">This filter is used by Sam Pro and TechAnywhere to filter Work Order Log Form Metrics lists. Note that Log Form Id field in the Client Site Equipment record determines which list of metrics is used. Multiple cycle codes may be entered as a comma-delimited list. If this field is blank, all metrics from the Log Form will be written to the Metrics tab.  </P>
 <P class="support" style="margin-left:36.00pt;">If one or more Cycle Codes are listed, only those Log Form (metrics) lines whose CC: field corresponds to the filter or is blank will be written to the Work Order (for Techs without remote access) or uploaded to the Technician’s device.</P>
 <P class="support" style="margin-left:36.00pt;">The Work Code in the Work Order header is used for metrics filtering purposes for Service Work Orders. </P>
 <P class="support" style="margin-left:36.00pt;">For PM Work Orders, the Cycle Code Filter (if completed) in the PM Schedule Tab of the Client Site Equipment, or the Schedule Tab of the Master Contract will override the Work Code’s Cycle Code Filter. </P>
 <P class="support" style="margin-left:36.00pt;">Example: Cycle Code Filter: 1,3</P>
 <P class="support" style="margin-left:36.00pt;">Only those lines from the Log Form whose CC field is set to 1, to 3 or is blank would be written to the Work Order or uploaded to the Technician’s device. </P>
 <P class="support" style="margin-left:36.00pt;">Client Site Equipment PM Schedule</P>
 <P class="support" style="margin-left:36.00pt;">New Field (click Magnify button to access) - Cycle Code Filter:</P>
 <P class="support" style="margin-left:36.00pt;">This filter is used by Sam Pro and TechAnywhere to filter PM Work Order Log Form Metrics lists for this piece of Equipment. Multiple cycle codes may be entered as a comma-delimited list. Note that Log Form field in the Client Site Equipment record determines which list of metrics is used.</P>
 <P class="support" style="margin-left:36.00pt;">If this field is blank, the system will use the Cycle Code in the Work Code instead. Only those metrics whose CC: field corresponds to the filter or is blank will be written to the Work Order (for Techs without remote access) or uploaded to the Technician’s device.  If the Cycle Code filter in both the Schedule and Work Code are blank, all metrics from the Log form will be written to the Metrics tab.  </P>
 <P class="support" style="margin-left:36.00pt;">If one or more Cycle Codes are listed, only those metrics whose CC: field corresponds to this field or is blank will be written to the Work Order (for Techs without remote access) or uploaded to the Technician’s device.</P>
 <P class="support" style="margin-left:36.00pt;">Master Contract Schedule Tab</P>
 <P class="support" style="margin-left:36.00pt;">New Field (click Magnify button to access) - Cycle Code Filter:</P>
 <P class="support" style="margin-left:36.00pt;">This filter is used by Sam Pro and TechAnywhere to filter PM Work Order Log Form Metrics lists for the Equipment being maintained. Multiple cycle codes may be entered as a comma-delimited list. Note that Log Form field in the Client Site Equipment record determines which list of metrics is used.</P>
 <P class="support" style="margin-left:36.00pt;">If this field is blank, the system will use the Cycle Code in the Work Code instead. Only those metrics whose CC: field corresponds to the filter or is blank will be written to the Work Order (for Techs without remote access) or uploaded to the Technician’s device.  If the Cycle Code filter in both the Schedule and Work Code are blank, all metrics from the Log form will be written to the Metrics tab.  </P>
 <P class="support" style="margin-left:36.00pt;">If one or more Cycle Codes are listed, only those metrics whose CC: field corresponds to this field or is blank will be written to the Work Order (for Techs without remote access) or uploaded to the Technician’s device.</P>
 <P class="support" style="margin-left:36.00pt;">TechAnywhere:</P>
 <P class="support" style="margin-left:36.00pt;">CC: Cycle Code. </P>
 <P class="support" style="margin-left:36.00pt;">TechAnywhere Metrics tables.</P>
 <P class="support" >4497  &nbsp;CRM Anywhere</P>
 <P class="support" style="margin-left:36.00pt;">In previous releases, if the registy option disablecrmmanagequotes was set to true in the web-settings registry, the Quote table was also suppressed in the Site View page.  In this release, the Quote table will also be suppressed in the Site View page when this option is implemented in the registry tab of the Web Profile or Web User.</P>
 <P class="support" >4517  &nbsp;Email – retest in 8.0</P>
 <P class="support" style="margin-left:36.00pt;">This release (used in conjunction with the xmlToPdf.jar file dated 11/8/2011) supports alternate email ports for emails with .pdf attachments (controlled by the xmlToPdf.jar file) as well as emails without pdf attachments (managed by SAM Pro). The following two additional options in sys-email are required to support this functionality:</P>
 <P class="support" style="margin-left:36.00pt;"><FONT style="font-weight:bold; " >Setting Key:</FONT> portsmtp   <FONT style="font-weight:bold; " >Setting Value:</FONT><FONT style="font-style:italic; " >port#</FONT><FONT style="font-style:italic; " >   (controls emails without pdf’s)</FONT></P>
 <P class="support" style="margin-left:36.00pt;"><FONT style="font-weight:bold; " >Setting Key:</FONT> smtpPort   <FONT style="font-weight:bold; " >Setting Value:</FONT><FONT style="font-style:italic; " >port#</FONT><FONT style="font-style:italic; " >   (controls emails with pdf’s)</FONT></P>
 <P class="support" style="margin-left:36.00pt;">This release also supports secure (SSL) email servers. To implement, the following additional registries are required:</P>
 <P class="support" style="margin-left:36.00pt;"><FONT style="font-weight:bold; " >Setting Key:</FONT> useSSL  &nbsp;<FONT style="font-weight:bold; " >Setting Value:</FONT> true</P>
 <P class="support" style="margin-left:36.00pt;"><FONT style="font-weight:bold; " >Setting Key:</FONT> MailerMethod  <FONT style="font-weight:bold; " >Setting Value:</FONT> Java    <FONT style="font-style:italic; " >(required to send non-pdf emails securely)</FONT></P>
 <P class="support" style="margin-left:72.00pt;"><FONT style="font-style:italic; " >Example: Use Port 465, Secure Server</FONT></P>
 <P class="support" style="margin-left:72.00pt;">Setting Key: portsmtp   Setting Value: 465</P>
 <P class="support" style="margin-left:72.00pt;">Setting Key: smtpPort   Setting Value:465 </P>
 <P class="support" style="margin-left:72.00pt;">Setting Key: useSSL  &nbsp;Setting Value: true</P>
 <P class="support" style="margin-left:72.00pt;">Setting Key: MailerMethod  Setting Value: Java    </P>
 <P class="support" style="margin-left:72.00pt;">Note: the applicable PasswordSMTP, UserNameSMTP, and serversmtp options must also be set. </P>
 <P class="support" >4521&nbsp;Work Order viewer {Church Services} </P>
 <P class="support" style="margin-left:36.00pt;">A TechFinder button has been added to the Technicians tab. When this button is clicked, the current work order's Client Site Zone and the Technician Certification (associated with the (*last – should be first*) Client Site Equipment record on the Work Order Equipment tab) are passed to the Tech Finder filters.</P>
 <P class="support" style="margin-left:36.00pt;">When the user completes the TechFinder processing, the system returns the selected Technician Id, Date and Time to Work Order the appropriate Technician line.</P>
 <P class="support" >4522  &nbsp;New Call</P>
 <P class="support" style="margin-left:36.00pt;">In New Call 1, if you decided that your site/equipment selections were not correct and entered a different search string, the fields that were previously completed were not automatically cleared for you although (clicking the New button would do so).</P>
 <P class="support" style="margin-left:36.00pt;">In this release, whenever a user tabs out of the search text box on New Call 1, the system will performs the equivalent action that pressing the New icon would do with one exception: if the Service Category is completed, it will not be cleared.</P>
 <P class="support" >4527  &nbsp;Quote Master Approval Wizard</P>
 <P class="support" style="margin-left:36.00pt;">In case 1730, we implemented a work order viewer registry option, DenyChangesToQuoteMasterLines, that denies the user the ability to change lines that were imported from Quote Master.  In recent versions, however, it was discovered that you could not approve a quote and write to a work order if this registry was enabled. This problem has been corrected in this image. </P>
 <P class="support" >4533  &nbsp;New Call (Hutchinson mod) </P>
 <P class="support" style="margin-left:36.00pt;">Add Log Form Id and Escalation Profile Id to the &quot;Flashlight&quot; Site screen of New Call 1 (original New Call back screen) so that users can specify them when creating new customers.</P>
 <P class="support" style="margin-left:36.00pt;">The Log Form Id: field has also been added to the original New Call screen. This field will default from the Equipment record, but may be changed by the user to specify which log form id will be specified on the work order about to be created. </P>
 <P class="support" >4536  &nbsp;Release Recurring AP Journal</P>
 <P class="support" style="margin-left:36.00pt;">In case 4284, we enabled the IgnoreCase3193 registry option to allow users to enter (among other things) a bank account on the Recurring AP Journal Recurring Lines tab. Previously, however, the Release Recurring AP Journal function did not evaluate this settings, and the post failed if a bank (or other denied) account was found. This problem has been corrected so the Release function successfully evaluates the sys-viewer-vrcrrngapjrnl for the IgnoreCase3193 option. </P>
 <P class="support" ><FONT style="text-decoration:underline;" >4537</FONT>  &nbsp;Sub Anywhere</P>
 <P class="support" style="margin-left:36.00pt;">In this release, the Work Performed is always posted to the Work Order. Previously, Work Performed was not being posted if the Original Work Order Id was completed.</P>
 <P class="support" ><FONT style="text-decoration:underline;" >4543 </FONT> &nbsp;Tech Anywhere</P>
 <P class="support" >&nbsp;Corrects problem where metrics were not written to work order from TechAnywhere. </P>
 <P class="support" >4547  &nbsp;Tech Anywhere Post</P>
 <P class="support" style="margin-left:36.00pt;">Corrects issue with Labor Rate erroneously defaulting from the Employee record if the client’s customization includes reordering of the Labor Journal Hours tab. See case for details. </P>
 <P class="support" >4551  &nbsp;Inventory Receipts Journal </P>
 <P class="support" style="margin-left:36.00pt;">Corrects a problem where Use Tax was not correctly written to the Tax History table when items were received in this viewer.  </P>
 <P class="support" > 4556  &nbsp;Tech Anywhere</P>
 <P class="support" style="margin-left:36.00pt;">This release corrects a problem where the Work Order Updates from TechAnywhere caused a WO Tech RN change. This case also changes the timing of email resulting from failed status updates so that both update methods get a chance to fail before the email goes out.&nbsp; Previously, failure to update by wrkordrtchncn_rn sent the email alert and then tried the second method (tech,date,old status) which might actually have been successful.&nbsp; This resulted in an erroneous (false positive) email alert; this should be eliminated in this image.</P>
 <P class="support" >4557  &nbsp;Work Order viewer</P>
 <P class="support" style="margin-left:36.00pt;">The Metrics tab is now correctly updated when equipment is added, inserted or deleted from the Equipment tab. This case also corrects an error which occurred when changing the Equipment Id that was associated with lines on the Metrics tab.</P>
 <P class="support" style="margin-left:36.00pt;">Note: If an Equipment Id associated with metrics is deleted, only those lines on the Metrics tab that have been recorded (a date and/or value entered) will be retained. If the same Equipment Id is re-entered, the system does not restore blank Metrics lines that were not recorded.</P>
 <P class="support" ><FONT style="text-decoration:underline;" >4563</FONT>  &nbsp;Sales Tax Authority (table changes)</P>
 <P class="support" >4567&nbsp;COP Acknowledgement Report</P>
 <P class="support" style="margin-left:36.00pt;">The COP Order Acknowledgement Report now suppresses the estimated sales tax if the Site COP tab has the Tax Exempt box flagged. </P>
 <P class="support" >4569  &nbsp;Log Form viewer </P>
 <P class="support" style="margin-left:36.00pt;">This viewer displays the correct error if you attempt to save the record with two lines having the same heading/line contents: LogFormLinesByDescriptionByParentRn for table ‘lgfrmlne’ would not be unique. The user must edit the offending line to insure its uniqueness before the record can be saved. </P>
 <P class="support" >4576  &nbsp;Recurring AP Journal</P>
 <P class="support" style="margin-left:36.00pt;">Corrects the calculation of the Recurring Lines Amount field based on the Quantity and Cost; previously, this calculation only supported Amounts under 100.00. </P>
 <P class="support" >4580  &nbsp;Tech Anywhere</P>
 <P class="support" style="margin-left:36.00pt;">Corrects Tech Anywhere intermittent issue posting COD multiple times.</P>
 <P class="support" >4582  &nbsp;Credit POs (UGH!) – in process.</P>
 <P class="support" style="margin-left:36.00pt;">Revised posting of credit POs costed to job/wo.</P>

 <P class="support" >4456  &nbsp;Tech Anywhere</P>
 <P class="support" style="margin-left:36.00pt;">This release better handles a rare bug that caused NewWOs messages to be sent to SAMPro without a Site ID resulting in a work order being created with no site, no job, and no equipment. SAM Pro now verifies that a TechAnywhere message contains the following before posting: Date Scheduled, Time Scheduled, Technician Id, Site Id Equipment Id. </P>
 <P class="support" style="margin-left:36.00pt;">The posting of new workorder messages can now handle the time scheduled of &quot;00:00&quot;, a valid time format for midnight.</P>
 <P class="support" style="margin-left:36.00pt;">Also Fixed bug where workorder created from TechAnywhere would have initial status of &quot;Pending&quot; rather than &quot;Unacknowledged&quot;.</P>

 <P class="support" style="margin-left:36.00pt;">This may be used to override the Pay Date entered on the Start AP Approved List (which may have been originally set on the Start AP Approved List PM). It would be used to make this process act like a 3<FONT style="vertical-align:super; " >rd</FONT> approval function so that invoices approved in this fashion are NOT paid as part of the normal AP Check printing process (because the date is set so far in the future). To pay these checks, a cash manager would run AP Date to Pay, filtering on the date referenced in this entry in the Next Pay Date range. The cash manager could then review the entries, and select an appropriate Pay Date. </P>

 <P class="support" style="margin-left:36.00pt;">A registry entry now required to validate that the system compares the total cost and quantity entered directly on the tab with the total cost and quantity posted to history. If all is well, the Work Order will be saved. If a discrepancy is found, a TabHistoryMismatch alert box will appear, and the work order will not be saved.  </P>
 <P class="support" style="margin-left:36.00pt;">The tab mismatch information will be written to the error log.  As a result of the work done in case 4482, this alert should now only appear when erroneous reversal history has already been written to Inventory History, and is therefore only recommended for users that are concerned with tightening up inventory, and who are willing to have support correct issues before work orders can be edited.

When they changed the date on the Other tab, and then invoiced the work order, the reversal in JCH is written to the new date - so when the WO is invoiced, the original date appears on the invoice, not the date it was changed to on the Work Order. The problem is corrected in this release by fixing the setting of 'closed period entry' flag on Work Order Other lines.</P>

 <P class="support" style="margin-left:36.00pt;">Previously, the SQL failed in SQL Server because the right-click, viewer opening technology assumed that all Id-type fields were character.&nbsp; The Web Log Id happens to be numeric for some unknown reason.

 <P class="support" >4482  &nbsp;Viewers (general) – Reversal Handling</P>
 <P class="support" style="margin-left:36.00pt;">This case Implements journal validation logic to prevent posting reversals with inappropriate Transaction Ids.  It was developed to handle a recently discovered situation where WO Inventory reversals to imhstry were being generated erroneously.&nbsp; The problem is sporadic and can't be reproduced on demand (but not for want of trying). The problem scenario goes like this ... user edits and saves Work Order A then edits and saves Work Order B without closing the viewer.&nbsp; In some situations, reversing entries are made against Work Order A with Work Order B taking credit for the reversal.</P>
 <P class="support" style="margin-left:36.00pt;">In this release, if SAM Pro detects this situation about to occur, it will suppress the erroneous reversal, AND make an error in the error log noting the reversal suppression. If the cus file is DB or the user is running in development mode, a message box will also appear. </P>

 <P class="support" style="margin-left:36.00pt;">Sybase 11 and 12 are NOT recommended for use with SAM Pro due to problems with floating point arithmetic. If a client does install Sybase 11 or 12, each SAM Pro image they run MUST be updated with the code from case 4305 before it is delivered to them.

 <P class="support" ><FONT style="text-decoration:underline;" >3814 </FONT> &nbsp;Check viewer</P>
 <P class="support" style="margin-left:36.00pt;">When SAM Pro is first implemented, checks originally written from the client’s old system are often manually added in SAM Pro. In the past, this required that a separate check ‘view’ be implemented via the customization field to allow entry to the check field, adding to the programming overhead for new install.</P>
 <P class="support" style="margin-left:36.00pt;">In this version, the standard Check viewer uses the standard User Group functionality to enable/disable user entry into this record.

The processing function is not capable of processing said type of data files, and therefore would reject the incoming data from ServiceChannel. The latest update to this case fixes this problem to ensure all data is separated into individual files.</P>

 <P class="support" style="margin-left:36.00pt;">Work Order Viewer: Web Log Field</P>
 <P class="support" style="margin-left:36.00pt;">A new column has been added to the wrkordr table for the purpose of providing a simple/reliable link to the associated Web Log. The Invoicing tab of the Work Order viewer shows the data from the associated Web Log entry if a Web Log was used to generate the Work Order. Any function capable of creating a new work order (New Call for example) from an existing Web Log entry will now set this field. </P>
 <P class="support" style="margin-left:36.00pt;">The new database column is not being retroactively loaded during database conversion due to concerns about performance. For anyone that requests it, the script attached to this case can be used to update the new column.</P>

The error occurred when printing logic was trying to obtain the DEVMODE structure for the printer. The PrintDialog logic has been changed so than all printers having an unavailable DEVMODE structures do not appear on the printer list.</P>

 <P class="support" >4325  &nbsp;Service Billing – COD Processing </P>
 <P class="support" style="margin-left:36.00pt;">Template-type clients should only be billed when the net invoice amount is exactly ZERO DOLLARS. This situation would be normal for residential accounts serviced and billed on a COD basis. SAMPRO must prevent the production of a non-zero-dollar invoice to any template-type client. <BR><BR>The Service Billing Worksheet report has been modified to display a very noticeable warning for each WO/Job invoice that would result in a template-type client being billed for any amount other than zero. In addition, the following changes have been added to the process of preparing Service Invoices ...</P>
 <P class="support" style="margin-left:36.00pt;">1. Compile a list of each WO/Job combination that meets the exclusion criteria implemented in the Service Invoice Report.<BR>2. Show the compiled list to the user in a Smalltalk workspace.<BR>3. Auto-save the compiled list as a text file. If the dbreportfiles registry entry exists, the system will use it to get the location to save the file with the Template Client errors. If the dbreportfiles registry entry does not exist, the Sampro base directory will be used to save the file with the Template Client errors.<BR>4. Work Orders that make the list CANNOT be included in the invoicing run.<BR></P>
 <P class="support" >4326  &nbsp;Tech Anywhere</P>
 <P class="support" style="margin-left:36.00pt;">The TechAnywhere posting function runs as a global user; in previous versions, Labor Journal and other transactions generated by the post were assigned global security.&nbsp; In this release, the post has been changed so that the security override from the Work Order is correctly applied to Labor Journal, Purchase Order, Sales Journal, Work Order children, and new Client Site Equipment records UNLESS the record is included in the sys-securityexceptionsbytable registry.</P>

 <P class="support" >4327  &nbsp;Remote Tech Helper (CLS mod)</P>
 <P class="support" style="margin-left:36.00pt;">This code was added to allow CLS to start a web listener for purposes of sending TechAnywhere like messages to SAM Pro's message table using HTTP POST commands. The reason this code is necessary is so that messages could post instantly to SAMPro and submit a result to the client. This differs from TechAnywhere's method in which the message is submitted without confirmation of a result.</P>

 <P class="support" >4346  &nbsp;Recurring AP Journal viewer (no code changes required)</P>

 <P class="support" > 4349  &nbsp;SQL History – New Runtime option</P>
 <P class="support" style="margin-left:36.00pt;">Previously, the option to capture and view SQL History was only available in development mode. Since there are times when it would be helpful for a 'regular' SAMPRO user to capture and then send the captured statements to support and/or programming, this feature has been added to the runtime Help menu. </P>
 <P class="support" style="margin-left:36.00pt;">New Help Menu Option: SQL History:</P>
 <P class="support" style="margin-left:36.00pt;">There may be times when your support representative needs to see the SQL generated by certain actions: the SQL History option has been added to the Help menu to enable this. </P>
 <P class="support" style="margin-left:36.00pt;">To capture SQL History, select Help &gt; SQL History.  This menu provides three options: Capture SQL History, View SQLHistory and Clear SQL History.  If a check mark does not yet appear next to Capture SQL History select this option to turn this feature on. </P>
 <P class="support" style="margin-left:36.00pt;">Next, perform the steps that your support representation tells you.</P>
 <P class="support" style="margin-left:36.00pt;">To view the SQL, use the menu option Help&gt;SQL History&gt;View SQL History</P>
 <P class="support" style="margin-left:36.00pt;">A workspace window will appear with the SQL history that has been logged. In the workspace, select File &gt; Save As.  A browser window will appear: browse to a location you will be able to retrieve the file from, and save it using an appropriate name. </P>
 <P class="support" style="margin-left:36.00pt;">The Help&gt;Clear SQL History option may be used to clear SQL history before making another test.</P>
 <P class="support" style="margin-left:36.00pt;">To toggle Capture SQL History off, select Help&gt;SQL History&gt; Capture SQL History.</P>
 <P class="support" style="margin-left:36.00pt;">Note that even if you do not explicitly turn this feature off, it will be disabled when you log off. </P>
 <P class="support" >4351  &nbsp;Tech Anywhere – MJI and Kaback</P>
 <P class="support" style="margin-left:36.00pt;">This release corrects a Tech Anywhere and Scheduled Event Manager Posting Conflict. Previously, while the TA posting agent is in the act of posting a completed work order message, the Scheduled Event Manager tries to process the UNCOMMITTED Web Log entry made for the tech's Service Recommendations. The solution is to have TA initially create the Web Log entry with a 'bogus' status that would prevent SEM from processing it. Then, immediately before TA commits its work, it would change the Web Log Status to its normal value of 'New'.</P>
 <P class="support" ><FONT style="text-decoration:underline;" >4353</FONT>  &nbsp;Start View DB Reports</P>
 <P class="support" style="margin-left:36.00pt;">In Start View DB Reports, path names were arbitrarily restricted to 60 characters, resulting in some reports with lengthy titles and paths not being viewable. Maximum size has been changed to 160.</P>
 <P class="support" style="margin-left:36.00pt;">SQL Server had an issue with the size of the time field in the temp table; this has been corrected.  </P>
 <P class="support" >4365  &nbsp;Job viewer</P>
 <P class="support" style="margin-left:36.00pt;">This release corrects a display issue on the JC Summary tab: in previous releases, moving the mouse over this tab result in buttons from the Main or Invoicing tabs showing through. </P>
 <P class="support" >4366  &nbsp;Physical Counting - Sue</P>
 <P class="support" style="margin-left:36.00pt;">This release corrects a problem in the List Physical Count report. Previously, only the items listed on the Physical Count Viewer were included in the report when the List Missing Items option was checked. The List Missing Items options, as well as the First and Last Uncounted fields in this report now work properly.</P>
 <P class="support" >4367   &nbsp;Asset viewer - Sue</P>
 <P class="support" style="margin-left:36.00pt;">This release corrects a spurious ‘Job is a Template record’ message when the user attempts to clear the Default Overhead Job fields from the Costing tab.</P>

 <P class="support" > 4372  &nbsp;Windows Menu (Tech Finder)</P>
 <P class="support" style="margin-left:36.00pt;">In previous releases, SAM Pro’s Windows menu did not list the TechFinder window when it was opened, including an extra Dispatch Board entry instead if it was launched from the Dispatch Board. When the TechFinder window was closed, the erroneous Dispatch Board entry was not removed from the menu, resulting in the software informing you that multiple Boards were open when in fact they were not. In this release, a TechFinder entry is added to the Windows menu when a TechFinder window is opened. When the TechFinder window is closed, it will be removed from the Windows menu. </P>
 <P class="support" >4374   &nbsp;Custom Index viewer – Internal</P>
 <P class="support" style="margin-left:36.00pt;">In this release, we added performance monitoring to Create and Drop Custom Index processing. This enhancement was implemented as a tool to enable programming to better determine where SQL bottlenecks exist and then to correct them.  See case for additional details. </P>
 <P class="support" >4376  &nbsp;Quote Master Wizard – CLS</P>
 <P class="support" style="margin-left:36.00pt;">The sys-viewer-vqte option ApprovalWizardDefaultTechStatus is used to set the default status in the Approval Wizard's Technician pane. In recent 7.3 releases, this option worked correctly UNLESS the technician was a subcontractor. In this release, the software has been corrected so that the ApprovalWizardDefaultTechStatus is also used for subcontractor technicians.</P>
 <P class="support" >4380  &nbsp;PM Workbench</P>
 <P class="support" style="margin-left:36.00pt;">The Progress tab now displays the Job Progress information correctly; in previous releases it was not displayed.</P>
 <P class="support" >4388  &nbsp;PM Workbench</P>
 <P class="support" style="margin-left:36.00pt;">This case extends the work done in case 191 that allows specific values to be passed from SAMPRO to an external app (for example, Crystal Reports) as a command line parameter.&nbsp; This functionality already exists for printing Quotes, POs, WO Tickets and Shop Tickets. </P>
 <P class="support" style="margin-left:36.00pt;">As we have done in the WO, Quote, PO and Shop Packet in previous SAM Pro versions, this enhancement allows Crystal Reports to pick up the specific ID (Job ID in this case) that is currently active in the program (PM Workbench in this case). With this new ability, Crystal Report Functions added to the Reports tab of the PM Workbench do not require the user to enter in the Job ID if the report is job based. The Crystal Report must use a parameter named exactly jb_id in order for it to have SAM Pro pass it to the report. </P>
 <P class="support" style="margin-left:36.00pt;">In the specific example of how it is being used, the Client wanted to print out a “log record” of Submittals and RFI requests made for the job so that they could give that document to the Client/Architect. Without this enhancement, they would have to double-click on the Crystal Report Function in the Reports tab and remember the job id so they could manually fill it in. With this feature, the user immediately gets the report to run with no interaction for that specific job they are on.</P>

 <P class="support" ><FONT style="font-weight:bold; " >Important Installation Note</FONT><FONT style="font-weight:bold; " >:</FONT> The zip file for this release<FONT style="font-weight:bold; " > </FONT>includes a Smalltalk object file containing all bitmap definitions currently being stored in the image (master~pushbuttons.obj) and an executable (v.exe) stripped of all bitmaps. This configuration should allow XP users to run without ‘non-continuable protection fault errors’. The bitmaps will be loaded at runtime from the master~pushbuttons.obj file and the SKIN1 directory (if bitmap skinning is in effect).

If an e-mail address exists in the Client Collections Email Address field, a pdf copy of their section of the report will be emailed to that address. In addition to installing the updated report, the following registry options must be added to the sys-report-rcuststmnt registry to enable this behavior.

 <P class="support" >3500  &nbsp;Sales Journal viewer</P>
 <P class="support" style="margin-left:36.00pt;">Validation now prevents the user from changing the Entry Type on an existing entry. By default, the Entry Type may only be changed in the Sale Journal is in ‘add’ mode. The following registry entry overrides the above validation, effectively restoring the previous behavior.

 <P class="support" >3862  &nbsp;Service Channel</P>
 <P class="support" style="margin-left:36.00pt;">This release now allows our ServiceChannel FMMS Bridge to support multiple companies (ServiceChannel PIN's) if needed. To support this, additional SAMPro registries can be made in the form of:</P>
 <P class="support" style="margin-left:36.00pt;">sys-fmms-vendor-ServiceChannel-pin-XXXX<BR><BR>This registry setting should only need to contain the user/password (InvoiceUID &amp; InvoicePWD) for that particular company (pin), but could be used to override other settings if needed. All other registry settings default from the base registry setting (sys-fmms-vendor-ServiceChannel), and the &quot;pin&quot; registry can be used to override the settings on a pin by pin basis.</P>
 <P class="support" >4031  &nbsp;Purchase Order viewer</P>
 <P class="support" style="margin-left:36.00pt;">Previously, users could go into purchase orders and change them from purchase orders to credit purchase orders and vice versa. This had more impact on clients using the Unvouchered Option in the Accounting period as it produced an out-of-balance gl transaction. In this release, validation has been added to lock this down. If the PO is in add mode, the user is allowed to switch between the Purchase and Credit types. Once the record has been added, however, the user must cancel the PO, and add it as the correct type. </P>
 <P class="support" style="margin-left:36.00pt;">A registry entry (not recommended) is available to ignore this validation and restore the previous behavior and allow the PO Type to be changed on existing Purchase Orders: </P>

 <P class="support" style="margin-left:36.00pt;">In previous releases, the mouse over box drawn around bitmaps was not always removed when the mouse was quickly run over a series of buttons.  This problem has been corrected in this build so that these “leftover” boxes no longer appear when the mouse has moved off of the button.  </P>

 <P class="support" style="margin-left:36.00pt;">In previous releases, Start Create EOM Unvouchered AP GL Entries skipped GEN lines from Credit PO’s but picked up Inventory lines.  In this release, applicable Inventory and Gen on Credit PO’s lines will be processed by this function. </P>
 <P class="support" >4236  &nbsp;Service Channel – Change to File Naming Logic</P>
 <P class="support" style="margin-left:36.00pt;">Previously, the naming logic took into account the possibility that another service request had previously been received at the same date and time (to seconds). It did this by checking the Inbound folder for file naming conflicts. This logic has been expanded so that the Archive and Reject folders are included in the naming conflict resolution.</P>

Site Latitude is blank, and<BR>2. Work/Ship Street Address includes the @ character.</P>
 <P class="support" style="margin-left:36.00pt;">The problem was caused because SageQuest uses the @ sign to parse the return information. When the information is returned from SageQuest, SAM Pro now only looks at the Geo Code, eliminating the problems previously caused by the @ sign in the address. </P>
 <P class="support" >4251  &nbsp;Inventory Item Stock Status viewer</P>

 <P class="support" style="margin-left:36.00pt;">In case 3185 validation was added to disallow changes to any scope lines if the status is set Printed, Accepted, Approved or Declined, forcing the user to change the status to Open to make changes. In addition, changes to Labor, Inventory, Material, Other and Subcontractor lines were only allowed if the associated Scope Option was set to Open.<BR><BR>The validation associated with Accepted options resulted in procedural issues for some of our customers.

When attempting to leave the not, the message “you cannot change the record because the change button is disabled” would appear, but it was impossible to refresh the record, close the notes viewer or exit SAM Pro correctly.

 <P class="support" style="margin-left:36.00pt;">When a Quote included multiple Subcontractor lines, the approval wizard attempted to generate one Tech tab line for each Subcontractor line, resulting in the violation of the constraint that multiple lines per Tech per day are not allowed, and the failure of the quote to post. In this release, the approval wizard sums the Subcontractor lines so that only one line for each Subcontractor will be written to the work order’s Tech tab, and the quote will post successfully. </P>

 <P class="support" ><FONT style="font-weight:bold; text-decoration:underline;" >4303</FONT><FONT style="font-weight:bold; " >  &nbsp;</FONT><FONT style="font-weight:bold; " >Location viewer</FONT><FONT style="font-weight:bold; " > – import Stock Levels</FONT></P>
 <P class="support" style="margin-left:36.00pt;">In <FONT style="font-family:'Verdana'; font-size:9pt; " >case 1418</FONT> we implemented the Import Stock Levels in the Location viewer. Currently, the Picking Sequence, Reorder Level and Order Up To fields for all selected items are imported, regardless of whether or not the item is flagged as Stocked.  This enhancement provides a registry entry that will filter out all items not flagged as 'Stocked'. </P>

 <P class="support" >4309  &nbsp;UserReport Internal Statistics - internal</P>
 <P class="support" style="margin-left:36.00pt;">In previous releases, UserReport-type wasted time and effort keeping internal stats that never get used. In this release, this stat-keeping effort is disabled except when a Performance Monitor is enabled.</P>
 <P class="support" >4317  &nbsp;Location viewer {APT}</P>
 <P class="support" style="margin-left:36.00pt;">The Location viewer now displays correctly if one or more inventory items on the Location Items tab have a quantity-on-hand of 100,000 or more. </P>
 <P class="support" ><FONT style="font-weight:bold; " >2011-09-16 (jt)-version 8.0.500.001</FONT></P>
 <P class="support" ><FONT style="font-weight:bold; " >Revised startme.exe</FONT></P>
 <P class="support" style="margin-left:36.00pt;">This release includes a new startme.exe file.  In this new file:</P>
 <P class="support" style="margin-left:36.00pt;">When the first user (of a particular OS) accesses a new image, the underscore version of the v.exe runtime will be generated with the user’s OS designation. For example, if you have XP and Windows 7 users, you would expect to see two runtime images: </P>
 <P class="support" style="margin-left:36.00pt;">V_2011_9_16_12_13__18_[Microsoft_Windows_XP].exe and </P>
 <P class="support" style="margin-left:36.00pt;">V_2011_9_16_12_13__18_[Microsoft_Windows_7_Professional].exe </P>
 <P class="support" style="margin-left:36.00pt;">XP users will be directed to the XP runtime, and Windows 7 Professional users will be access the Windows 7 runtime. It is hoped that this will reduce the incidence of non-continuable protection fault errors. </P>
 <P class="support" >4003  &nbsp;AP Payment Approval (Kaback mods) </P>
 <P class="support" style="margin-left:36.00pt;">When running under the KABACK cus; there are changes to the screen displays for Start AP Payment Approved List PM (approver1), Start AP Payment Approved List (approver2), View AP Date To Pay List (approver3).</P>
 <P class="support" style="margin-left:36.00pt;">They all have been reconstructed to look very similar with slight variations. New fields add. Functionally, a change was made that now we track how much each approver releases for payment. This is done so that we now know what approver's list to send the transaction back to after payment processing. </P>
 <P class="support" style="margin-left:36.00pt;">An example may better describe this functionality.<BR>Vendor's invoice is for $1000.00. Approver 1 approves $800, Approver 2 is at $800, Approver 3 pays $500. In this example Approver 1 and 2 will not see this invoice on their list again until Approver 3 pays the remaining $300. Example 2: Vendor's invoice is for $1000. Approver 1 approves $800, Approver 2 is at $800, Approver 3 pays $800. Now this transaction will be back on Approver 1's list to allow him to approve the remaining $200.</P>

 <P class="support" >4238 &nbsp;Viewers (general) right-click open of viewers</P>
 <P class="support" style="margin-left:36.00pt;">The Work Order viewer provides two ways to get to the Purchase Order viewer.&nbsp; The first is with a right-click on the Purchase Order Id field found on the WO viewer's Main parent tab.&nbsp; The second is with a double-click on a PO line found on the viewer's Purchases (FieldListPane) parent tab. <BR>The second method appears to initiate fewer events associated with the viewer's #keyNames and #keyValues panes.&nbsp; This makes for a more efficient and quicker open.&nbsp; This release changes the right-click methodology to match that used for the double-click methodology on a FieldListPane list line.</P>
 <P class="support" style="margin-left:36.00pt;">This case also implements debugging aid that shows current Stack Trace in a new workspace.</P>

 <P class="support" >4011  &nbsp;Expanded Smalltalk VM to 250</P>
 <P class="support" style="margin-left:36.00pt;">SAM Pro’s Smalltalk virtual memory has been expanded to 250MB from 150MB.  This should better accommodate the running of extremely long reports and the unfiltered display of history viewers. </P>
 <P class="support" >4225  &nbsp;Job Cost Code and Billing Item</P>
 <P class="support" style="margin-left:36.00pt;">The Job Id is now a required field in the Job Cost Code and Job Billing Item viewers. </P>
