<h1>User Group Functions Viewer</h1>
<h2>Purpose:</h2>
<p>Required to define which viewers, reports and functions the members 
 of a User Group have access to. This viewer may also be used to create 
 the User Groups themselves.</p>
<h2>Example:</h2>
<p>If you had created a user group named DISPATCHERS, you would most likely 
 want to include View Dispatch Board in their functions list, but omit 
 the accounting functions. Likewise, if you had also created an ACCOUNTANTS 
 user group, you would allow them access to accounting functions, but not 
 the dispatch board.</p>
<h2>Usage:</h2>
<p>Required to define to access to functions and reports for members of 
 this User Group.</p>
<p>User Group All should only be used by system admins or other high level 
 personnel. It may NOT be altered by users. Note 
 that in User Group All, the Viewer Export Function is supported even if 
 the box is not flagged.</p>
<h2>Important Fields: Upper Section</h2>
<p>The User Group Functions screen is divided into upper and lower sections. 
 The upper section contains the User Group record. For details on the upper 
 section, click <a href="User_Groups_Viewer.htm">User Groups Viewer</a> 
 .</p>
<h2>Important Fields: Lower Section</h2>
<p>The Functions List displays which (if any) functions are currently available 
 for this Group. Contact your Data-Basics support representative for additional 
 information on which functions should be included for each of your user 
 groups.</p>
<p style="margin-left: 36.00pt;"><font style="font-weight: bold;">Tip:</font> 
 if you wish to control access, add, change or delete privileges to a two-part 
 or tabbed viewer, both the parent and child views must be edited. For 
 example, if you want to let users add or change their dispatch board definitions, 
 but not delete them, both View Boards and View Boards and Technicians 
 would need to be edited so that the Delete box was not checked. In this 
 example, the Access, Add, and Change boxes should be checked.</p>
<p><font style="font-weight: bold;">Function Name:</font><br/>
The name of the function; this display-only field is maintained by the 
 system.</p>
<p><font style="font-weight: bold;">Access?</font><br/>
If this field is checked, members of this group will have access to this 
 function and can view all the information available on the record.</p>
<p>If this box is blank, members of this group will not have access to 
 the records in the function.  However, users will be granted access 
 to the LIST views. </p>
<p>Double-click on this box to check/clear it.</p>
<p><font style="font-weight: bold;">Add</font><br/>
If the Access and the Add boxes are checked, members of this user group 
 will be able to add records to this viewer.</p>
<p><font style="font-weight: bold;">Change</font><br/>
If the Access and the Change boxes are checked, members of this user group 
 will be able to change records in this viewer.</p>
<p><font style="font-weight: bold;">Delete</font><br/>
If the Access and the Delete boxes are checked, members of this user group 
 will be able to delete records from this viewer providing a) the record 
 has no associated history and b) programming logic does not  exist 
 to disallow this functionality.  For example, deleting a check 
 and deleting an invoice are not allowed.</p>
<p><font style="font-weight: bold;">Export</font><br/>
This field enables you to enable/disable printing or saving CSV and Table 
 Report files on a per viewer basis. To disable printing and saving of 
 a viewer list (as a report or csv file), clear the Export box in the applicable 
 User Groups and Functions record or records. The csv and table report 
 buttons will be grayed out in a record viewer it the Export box has been 
 cleared.  <span>Note that in User Group All, the Viewer Export Function 
 is supported even if the box is not flagged.</span></p>
