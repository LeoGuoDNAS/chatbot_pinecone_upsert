<h1>Tax History Viewer</h1>
<h2>Tax History Viewer</h2>
<h2>Purpose:</h2>
<p>This table was added in version 7.1 to enable better sales tax reporting for our developers and for third-party products such as Crystal Reports. <font style="font-weight: bold;">Access to this viewer</font> <font style="font-weight: bold;">should be</font> <font style="font-weight: bold;">limited to read-only access for report-writers; the fields in this viewer should NEVER be altered by users.</font></p>
<p>The <a href="Sales_Tax_Summary_by_Tax_Group_Report_.htm">Sales Tax Summary by Tax Group Report</a> runs off of the contents of this table.</p>
<h2>Important Fields:</h2>
<p>Tax History Id: Source Journal: Transaction Id: Source Journal Rn:<br/>
Source Tab: Period Id: Date Effective: Description:<br/>
This portion of the viewer provide lists the source journal information for this entry.</p>
<p>PO Id: Vendor Id:<br/>
WO Id: Job Id: Cost Cost: Bill Item: Cost Category:<br/>
Inventory Idem Id: Item Description: Quantity: Unit Price: Reversal:<br/>
Posted By: Date Posted: Time Posted<br/>
This portion of the viewer lists the applicable detail for this line, whether or not it was generated by a reserval, and the user, date and time of the entry.</p>
<p>Tax Type Id: Tax Group Id: Tax Authority Id: Tax Rate:<br/>
Note that both the Tax Group and Authority are recorded.</p>
<p>AP Invoice Id: Tax Base AP: Tax Amount AP:<br/>
These fields are recorded when the following entries are made or edited:</p>
<p>AP Journalâ€™s Tax Tab (when a vendor invoice is vouchered).</p>
<p>AR Invoice Id: Invoice Amount AR:<br/>
This fields are generated when an AR Sales journal entry is made (either directly, when an invoice is posted, or an invoice is reversed).</p>
<p>Tax Base AR: Tax Amount AR:<br/>
These fields would be completed if this line is sales taxable (for example, sales tax on an inventory item) and the job is sales taxable.</p>
<p>For example, if $150 of materials was recorded on a Sales Tax Job, the AR Invoice fields would be completed as follows for a tax rate of 3%:</p>
<p>AR Invoice Id: 10233<br/>
Invoice Amount AR: 150.00<br/>
Tax Base AR: 150.00<br/>
Tax Amount AR: 4.50<br/>
Tax Exempt AR: 0<br/>
Amnt Not Taxable AR: 0</p>
<p>Tax Exempt AR:<br/>
If this line was recorded for a Tax Exempt job, the tax exempt amount will be recorded in this field.</p>
<p>For example, if $540 of materials was recorded on a Tax Exempt Job, the AR Invoice fields would be completed as follows:</p>
<p>AR Invoice Id: 10307<br/>
Invoice Amount AR: 500.00<br/>
Tax Base AR: 0<br/>
Tax Amount AR: 0<br/>
Tax Exempt AR: 500.00<br/>
Amnt Not Taxable AR: 0</p>
<p>Amount Not Taxable AR:<br/>
If this line was recorded for a Sales Taxable Job, but the line itself was not subject to taxable, this field will be completed.</p>
<p>For example, if $200 of labor was recorded on a Sales Tax Job, the AR Invoice fields would be completed as follows:</p>
<p>AR Invoice Id: 10443<br/>
Invoice Amount AR: 200.00<br/>
Tax Base AR: 0<br/>
Tax Amount AR: 0<br/>
Tax Exempt AR: 0<br/>
Amt Not Taxable AR: 200.00</p>
<p>Use Base Use: Tax Amount Use:<br/>
For Work Orders referencing Use Tax jobs, these fields will be completed when Work Order Inventory or Other lines are entered / edited, or a PO referencing a Use Tax WO is received, assuming that the sys-ffv-global-settings registry option InventoryCostIncludesTax=true is NOT set.</p>
