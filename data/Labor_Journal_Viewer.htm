<h1>Labor Journal Viewer</h1>
<h2>Purpose:</h2>
<p>Create/maintain the list of Payroll time card entries.</p>
<h2>Usage:</h2>
<p>Time applicable to specific Work Orders may be entered in this journal 
 or directly on the Work Order&#39;s Labor tab.</p>
<p style="margin-left: 36.00pt;"><font style="font-weight: bold;">Credit 
 Hold Work Orders:</font> A Credit Manager must clear the Credit Hold flag 
 on a Work Order before time or materials may be added to it from the Work 
 Order or Labor Journal.</p>
<p>For existing entries, the system checks employee/payroll combinations 
 for existing payroll checks. This is done in order to ‘lock down’ labor 
 journal entries after the payroll check is printed.</p>
<p>If the Payroll Period is Active, but the Prior Period Accrual Period 
 is Inactive, the user is prevented from changing a line when the Date 
 falls in the Prior Period Accrual date range. </p>
<p>If Time Review for TechAnywhere time is enabled, a user may access the 
 Labor Journal, and save the entry to mark the time as reviewed. Time may 
 also be approved from the Word Order Revenue tab by right-clicking on 
 a line. No special user attribute is required: all that is needed is for 
 someone other than the tech to ‘touch’ the entry. See <a href="Registry_Entry_Labor_Journal_Certified_PR_Warning.htm">Registry 
 Labor Journal (sys-viewer-vlbrjrnl)</a> for details.</p>
<h2>Important Fields:</h2>
<p style="margin-left: 36.00pt;"><font style="font-weight: bold;">Note:</font> 
 this Help Topic lists the standard configuration of all fields that may 
 be included in this record. If you are using a customized system, the 
 fields displayed on your screen may not exactly match the fields described 
 in this Topic.</p>
<p>This viewer is divided into two sections. The upper section contains 
 the basic transaction header information. The lower section displays the 
 Hours item (time card) detail. Clicking the Other tab enables you to enter 
 Other expenses such as mileage. Click on one of the following buttons 
 for detailed information.</p>
<p><a href="Labor_Journal_Labor_Tab.htm"><img src="assets/images/image/btn_Hours.gif" alt="image\btn_Hours.gif" title="image\btn_Hours.gif" width="50" height="24" border="0"/></a> <a href="Labor_Journal_Viewer_Other_Tab.htm"><img src="assets/images/image/btn_Other.gif" alt="image\btn_Other.gif" title="image\btn_Other.gif" width="47" height="24" border="0"/></a> <a href="Labor_Journal_Time_Log_Tab.htm"><img src="assets/images/image/btn_Time_Log32.gif" alt="image\btn_Time_Log32.gif" title="image\btn_Time_Log32.gif" width="71" height="24" border="0"/></a></p>
<h2>Registry:</h2>
<p><a href="Registry_Entry_Labor_Journal_Certified_PR_Warning.htm">Labor 
 Journal Registry Entries</a></p>
<p>IIf the user enters a Work Order Id on any of the detail tabs, the system 
 will default in the first piece of equipment on the Work Order’s Equipment 
 tab UNLESS this behavior is disabled via registry (see <a href="Registry_Entry_Global_Settings__Column_Compression__Dispatch_Board_Rows__History_Log_Inventory_Markup.htm#global_settings_journal_equipment_id">Registry 
 Option Global Settings - Do Not Default Equipment Id</a>).</p>
<h2>Upper Section:</h2>
<p class="Tab" style="background-color: #e5e5e5; border-top: 1.50pt solid #000000; 
	 border-bottom: 1.50pt solid #000000; border-left: 1.50pt solid #000000; 
	 border-right: 1.50pt solid #000000;">Main Tab</p>
<p><font style="font-weight: bold;">Employee Id:</font><br/>
Enter the employee this journal entry is for (or double-click to select 
 from your firm&#39;s list of employees). This field cannot be changed after 
 detail lines have been entered. The user is warned when a terminated employee 
 has been selected.</p>
<p><font style="font-weight: bold;">Entered By: Date Entered: Time Entered:</font><br/>
These display-only fields are maintained by the system based on your user 
 Id and the system date and time.</p>
<p><font style="font-weight: bold;">Total Hours:</font><br/>
The total number of hours to be included on this journal entry. The display-only 
 Total Hours Entered: field maintains a running total of the hours entered 
 in the lower (detail) portion of the screen. These figures must match 
 or you will not be allowed to create or modify this journal entry.</p>
<p><font style="font-weight: bold;">Pay Period Id:</font><br/>
The Pay Period flagged as ‘default’ will be loaded when you create a new 
 journal entry. To select a different period, enter its Id, or double click 
 to select from a list. The display-only Period Start and Period End Dates 
 will appear when a Pay Period is selected.</p>
<p>Validation is performed on a line by line basis to ensure that the Accounting 
 Period is active (if the Effective Date falls within the Accounting Period) 
 and that the Accrual Accounting Period is active (if the Effective Date 
 falls within the Accrual Accounting Period).</p>
<p>Validation also prevents changing the 
 Payroll Period on an existing entry from one that has Accrue to GL enabled 
 to one with Accrual to GL disabled and vice versa.</p>
<p><font style="font-weight: bold;">Effective Date:</font><br/>
This field provides the default Effective Date for the line item detail. 
 When the Payroll Period defaults in or 
 is changed, the parent Effective Date will be changed if needed to ensure 
 it falls within the selected Pay Period.</p>
<p>You may enter the effective date in <font style="font-style: italic;">mmddyyyy</font> 
 format (or double-click to access the Calendar viewer). When you save 
 this record, the system will verify that the Effective Date falls within 
 the date range defined by the Pay Period record.</p>
<p><font style="font-weight: bold;">Transaction Description:</font><br/>
This optional field may be used to provide a description for this transaction. 
 It will provide a default description (for reporting purposes) it the 
 Description field if the transaction detail is not completed.</p>
<p><font style="font-weight: bold;">Transaction Id:</font><br/>
If you are creating a new transaction, this Id will be generated for you 
 where you save the record. If you wish to correct or reverse an entry, 
 enter its Id.</p>
<p><font style="font-weight: bold;">Period Start Date: Period End Date:</font><br/>
These display-only fields default from the information specified in the 
 Pay Period record.</p>
<p><font style="font-weight: bold;">Labor Rate Id:  Pay Type Id:  <br/>
Earnings Group Id:  Deduction Group Id:  WC Category Id:<br/>
</font> These display-only fields default from the Employee record. However, 
 if you are entering time for a Prevailing Wages Job, the values found 
 in the EMP tab of the Job record will override the default Earnings Group, 
 Deduction Group, Labor Rate and Pay Type when making individual line item 
 entries. Prevailing wage overrides will only be implemented when the cost 
 code type is set to field.</p>
<p><font style="font-weight: bold;">Display Fields – Summary of Time Entered:</font></p>
<p style="margin-left: 36.00pt;"><font style="font-weight: bold;">Transaction: 
  Reg – OT – DT – Other – Total<br/>
Pay Period:  Reg – OT – DT – Other – Total<br/>
</font> These fields provide a summary of time entered on this transaction 
 and for all Labor Journal transactions for this Pay Period and Employee 
 (hours entered on the Work Order Labor tab are not included in this summary. 
 The hours are categorized based on the new Category field in the Pay Type 
 Record. Note that the Transaction hours in the summary is set to zero 
 when the transaction&#39;s Next Id is not blank.</p>
<p><img alt="" src="assets/images/ApproveTime.bmp" style="border: none;" border="0"/> 
 To approval an &#39;Approval Required&#39; Labor Journal entry, correct the entry 
 as needed and then click the Approve Time button. If all the issues have 
 been corrected, the time will be posted to Job History and the user will 
 be asked to confirm the change.</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: bold;">Approval Required:</span><br/>
The Approval Required field may be set in one of two ways:</p>
<p style="margin-left: 48px;">A registry has been enabled to allow failed 
 time messages from TechAnywhere to be written to the Labor Journal where 
 they may be corrected and approved so that they will be posted to Job 
 History.</p>
<p style="margin-left: 48px;">For certain customizations, the Time Entry 
 Approval Required field is exposed in the Employee record. Time entered 
 in TimeAnywhere or the Labor Journal for employees that Require Approval 
 will must have a Time Entry Admin user approve the entries. In this case, 
 the Approve Time button can be used by a Time Entry Admin user to approve 
 transactions when necessary.</p>
<p style="margin-left: 88px;"><span style="font-weight: bold;">Filtering 
 Approval Required Entries:</span><br/>
The &#39;Approval Required&#39; Labor Journal filter range should be set to Y to 
 filter on Approval Required transactions.</p>
<p style="margin-left: 88px;"><span style="font-weight: bold;">Entries 
 that will not be Approved:</span><br/>
If an entry will not be approved, delete all Labor Journal detail lines, 
 set the Total Hours to zero, and then mark the transaction approved.</p>
<p style="margin-left: 8px;"><span style="font-weight: bold;">Approved 
 By, Approved Date and Approved Time</span><br/>
These fields will be set then the time is approved.</p>
<p><font style="font-weight: bold;"><img src="assets/images/ResetRates.bmp" alt="" style="border: none;" border="0"/></font> 
  If an employee&#39;s pay (earnings) rate was changed mid-pay period, 
 clicking the new Reset Rates button automatically recomputes each line 
 in the selected Labor Journal entry, and asks the user to confirm the 
 change.  </p>


<p><font style="font-weight: bold;">Security Id:</font><br/>
If multiple location security is implemented on your centralized database 
 system, this informational field displays the Security Id of the local 
 user that created this record. If multiple location security is not implemented 
 on your system, or if this record was created by a global user, this field 
 will be blank.</p>

	 border-right: 1.50pt solid #000000;">GLH Tab</p>
