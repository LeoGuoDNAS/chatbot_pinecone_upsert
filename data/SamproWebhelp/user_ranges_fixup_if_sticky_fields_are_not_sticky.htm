<P class="Support_Heading_2" >User Ranges Fixup if Sticky Fields are not Sticky</P>
 <P class="Support" >If a user’s sticky fields are not sticky (for example, if Dispatch Board settings are not being retained), it may be due to a missing key problem with Ranges table.</P>
 <P class="Support" >Some of the starter databases were missing a unique index on the ranges field. What was happening was the user could change the sticky field but it would store it as a separate entry rather than overwriting the existing entry. This caused the Ranges table to grow and grow. When the user went in to the viewer with the sticky field that they changed the value on, it was reading and filling in the sticky field with the first set of values it found in the table (which was the original entry). It was ignoring the last entry because it only expected one entry. The script below deletes the duplicate entries and tries to set the index (so no duplicates can be created). The index cannot be set if there are duplicates.</P>
 <P class="Support" >This is particularly a problem with 'sticky' fields where it can result in thousands of entries. This can have a severe performance problem for viewers. A utility is now available which will clean up the ranges table and create the required index.</P>
 <P class="Support" style="margin-left:36.00pt;">To resolve the problem from the Transcript window, execute one of the following:</P>
 <P class="Support" style="margin-left:36.00pt;">&nbsp;FieldTest fixSQLServerRangesProblem:true&nbsp; &quot;--Fixup and commit each key</P>
 <P class="Support" style="margin-left:72.00pt;"><FONT style="font-weight:bold; " >Note:</FONT> this option commits immediately – it is the best one to run but can take the longest. You can run it multiple times until you get no errors</P>
 <P class="Support" style="margin-left:36.00pt;">FieldTest fixSQLServerRangesProblem:false&nbsp; &quot;--Fixup and commit when done&quot;<BR>FieldTest fixSQLServerRangesProblem:nil&nbsp; &nbsp; &quot;--Fixup with no commit&quot;</P>
 <P class="Support" >On completion of execution (which might take several minutes) the requisite index will have been created and an operation log will be displayed. </P>
 <P class="Support" ><FONT style="font-weight:bold; " >Note:</FONT> These operations are also incorporated into the database conversion. </P>
