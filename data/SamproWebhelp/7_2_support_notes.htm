 <P class="support" ><FONT style="text-decoration:underline;" >####</FONT>&nbsp;Underlined cases appear in 7.2 and up only or special processing for 7.2</P>
 <P class="support" >####* &nbsp;One star means that additional testing is needed</P>
 <P class="support" >####**&nbsp;Two stars mean additional work is needed – the case is in process</P>
 <P class="support" >Since we do table work from time to time that does not require a database revision, our new guideline is to have everyone (including agents AND techanywhere users) logged off before the update. This will also ensure that users will actually be using the new image immediately, rather than when they get around to it.</P>
 <P class="support" >4553<FONT style="font-weight:bold; " > &nbsp;</FONT>W2 Audit Report</P>
 <P class="support" style="margin-left:36.00pt;">The Audit Report option of Report W2 Electronic File (report RW2EF.rpt dated 2/21/2012) has been modified so that the totals row is offset so that larger payroll amounts do not overlap.  This change impacts the Audit option only. This report is suitable for version 7.2 and up.</P>

 <P class="support" >4446&nbsp;W2 - modify W3 form printing</P>
 <P class="support" style="margin-left:36.00pt;">Supports several formatting changes in the W3 form printed for 2011 taxes. </P>
 <P class="support" ><FONT style="text-decoration:underline;" >4031</FONT>  &nbsp;Purchase Order viewer</P>
 <P class="support" style="margin-left:36.00pt;">In previous releases, users had the ability to go into purchase orders and change them from purchase orders to credit purchase orders and vice versa without any checks or tests. This had more impact on clients using the Unvouchered Option in the Accounting period as it produce an out-of-balance gl transaction.</P>
 <P class="support" style="margin-left:36.00pt;">In this release, validation has been added to lock this down. If the PO is in add mode, the user is allowed to switch between the Purchase and Credit types. Once the record has been added, however, the user most cancel the PO, and add it as the correct type. </P>
 <P class="support" style="margin-left:36.00pt;">A registry entry (not recommended) is available to ignore this validation and restore the previous behavior and allow the PO Type to be changed on existing Purchase Orders: </P>

 <P class="support" ><FONT style="text-decoration:underline;" >4103</FONT>  &nbsp;History viewers</P>
 <P class="support" style="margin-left:36.00pt;">This release extends the ability to successfully create a named range to history viewers opened at the filter as specified in case 4262. </P>
 <P class="support" ><FONT style="font-weight:bold; " >2011-09-12 (jb)-version 7.2.476.110</FONT></P>

 <P class="support" style="margin-left:36.00pt;">Increase Size of Rate Fields For NonLabor Lines From (9,4) To (10,4). Report dated 8/22/2011 is suitable for version 7.2 and higher.</P>
 <P class="support" ><FONT style="text-decoration:underline;" >4023</FONT>  &nbsp;Service Invoicing</P>
 <P class="support" style="margin-left:36.00pt;">Corrects a problem where sales tax was assessed on Use Tax jobs when the Max Tax per Invoice protocol was implemented via registry (SalesTaxMaxPerInvoice=true in sys-ffv-global-settings). This case 'finishes' case 695 by ensuring that all sales/use tax calculations are performed by the code implemented in 695.</P>
 <P class="support" ><FONT style="text-decoration:underline;" >3947 </FONT> &nbsp;Prevailing Wage Job Costing</P>
 <P class="support" style="margin-left:36.00pt;">When using the Prevailing Wage logic on a job, the job cost calculated for overtime was incorrect. This has been corrected in this release so that the job cost is no longer inflated.</P>
 <P class="support" ><FONT style="text-decoration:underline;" >4103</FONT>  &nbsp;Viewers </P>
 <P class="support" style="margin-left:36.00pt;">This release extends the ability to successfully create a named range to history viewers opened at the filter as specified in case 4262. </P>
 <P class="support" ><FONT style="text-decoration:underline;" >4205</FONT>&nbsp;AR Sales Journal viewer</P>
 <P class="support" style="margin-left:36.00pt;">Previously, when using the Create Credit Memo Button against a COP posting, the line amounts did not total correctly if the Costs child table was selected: whatever line your focus was on the Prices Tab would no longer be included in the line totals. This has been corrected in this release.</P>
 <P class="support" ><FONT style="text-decoration:underline;" >4081</FONT>  &nbsp;Reports Saved to CSV System Primitive Failure error</P>
 <P class="support" style="margin-left:36.00pt;">The 'FieldReport class&gt;&gt;textFormatToCSV:with:' takes a parameter which is a collection of strings, each one of which represents 4 pieces of data separated by a pipe character. Under some circumstances, the string only contains 3 pieces of data causing a Primitive Failure when an attempt is made to extract the 4th piece of data. This problem has been solved by detecting this situation and defaulting the 4th piece to '' when it is missing.</P>
 <P class="support" ><FONT style="font-weight:bold; " >Enhanced Report: </FONT></P>
 <P class="support" style="margin-left:36.00pt;">Report Customer Statement</P>
 <P class="support" style="margin-left:36.00pt;">This report now supports auto-emailing in the Customer Statements report (RCUSTSTMNT.rpt) dated 8/30/2011 or later. If an e-mail address exists in the Client Collections Email Address field, a pdf copy of their section of the report will be emailed to that address. In addition to installing the updated report, the following registry options must be added to the sys-report-rcuststmnt registry to enable this behavior. This report is suitable for version 7.0 and above.</P>

 <P class="support" ><FONT style="text-decoration:underline;" >3909</FONT>&nbsp;Report Quote Form (RQTEFRM.rpt)</P>
 <P class="support" style="margin-left:36.00pt;">The quantity fields which show on the quote have been changed to only display 2 decimal places to be consistent with the labor detail lines.This report is dated 6/20/2011, and is suitable for version 7.2 and up. </P>
 <P class="support" >4030&nbsp;Drill-Down Client Profitablity Report (DCPRTR.rpt and CCPRTR1.rpt)</P>
 <P class="support" style="margin-left:36.00pt;">The<FONT style="font-weight:bold; " > </FONT>Service Account Manager from the Client Site has been added to the Drilldown Client Profitability report as a new range field. Both the DCPRTR.rpt (dated 6/10/2011) and the CCPRTR1.rpt (dated 6/13/2011) must be installed to support this functionality. These reports are suitable for version 7.0 and up. </P>
 <P class="support" ><FONT style="text-decoration:underline;" >3945</FONT>  &nbsp;New Call / Work Order Other lines {RSD}</P>
 <P class="support" style="margin-left:36.00pt;">The Client Site’s WO Other tab may be used to generate standard trip or truck charges to Work Orders created in New Call. In previous releases, the Sales Tax Group and Type for the Work Order Other lines generated in this fashion were derived from the Sales Tax Group on the Client Site COP tab. In this release, the system now uses the Sale Tax Group in the Job record when generating the Work Order Other tab line. . </P>
 <P class="support" ><FONT style="text-decoration:underline;" >3959 </FONT> &nbsp;Report display issues w/wheel mouse</P>
 <P class="support" style="margin-left:36.00pt;">If a user Computes a Service Invoice, chooses a printer, and then moves their mouse wheel around prior to the actual display of the invoice, they can end up with a “Key is missing” error message. It will basically leave the job history marked with the AR Invoice ID, but no changes on the Invoice Master (status unknown), no AR history and no GL history. This release should prevent scrolling errors while waiting for report to display.</P>
 <P class="support" ><FONT style="text-decoration:underline;" >3631</FONT>  &nbsp;Drilldown Reports</P>
 <P class="support" style="margin-left:36.00pt;">This release corrects a problem with drilldown reports which used hidden fields to pass values to component reports; the hidden field information (such as the Client Id) was not being passed correctly when doubling-clicking in the report to drill down. This version includes modified code to only exclude hidden fields from creation of PDF files.</P>
 <P class="support" ><FONT style="font-weight:bold; " >2011-05-20 (jb)-version 7.2.476.108</FONT></P>
 <P class="support" ><FONT style="text-decoration:underline;" >3899 </FONT> &nbsp;Windows Registry used for Launching External Apps</P>
 <P class="support" style="margin-left:36.00pt;">The system now uses the Windows Registry to find the path to Applications by Exe Name.</P>
 <P class="support" style="margin-left:36.00pt;">In particular, this will enable users using a 64 bit operating system to successfully run Crystal Viewer 2.  Installation notes and application executable for Crystal Viewer 2 are available from support. </P>
 <P class="support" ><FONT style="text-decoration:underline;" >3904</FONT>  &nbsp;Document Management</P>
 <P class="support" style="margin-left:36.00pt;">This enhancement allows the user to specify attachments to other tables in the record when attaching or scanning a new document from the viewer (functionality that Quick Attach already provides). </P>
 <P class="support" style="margin-left:36.00pt;">To implement, registry add the following option to the viewer’s registry entry: </P>
 <P class="support" style="margin-left:36.00pt;">Setting Key: DocumentReferences  Setting Value: table1,table2,table3  …</P>
 <P class="support" style="margin-left:36.00pt;">Where the table1 etc. are replaced with an appropriate internal database table name or comma delimited list of tables.  </P>

 <P class="support" ><FONT style="text-decoration:underline;" >2051</FONT>  &nbsp;Help Handles</P>
 <P class="support" style="margin-left:36.00pt;">Context-sensitive help for Start Archive Work Orders added; if a database conversion has not been triggered with this version, Start Function List Update must be run for this change to be implemented. </P>
 <P class="support" ><FONT style="text-decoration:underline;" >3888</FONT><FONT style="font-weight:bold; " >  &nbsp;</FONT>Purchase Order Generation</P>
 <P class="support" style="margin-left:36.00pt;">Validation has been added so that PO generation is not allowed if the current system date (today) exceeds the Job Closed date. This validation has been added to the following records: Job Record (Create PO button), Project Manager Viewer (Create PO button, Work Order (Create PO button and Material Requisitioning), Purchase Order (PO cannot be added if the header Job’s Date Closed is before the Release date). </P>

 <P class="support" >3870&nbsp;Margin Issue On Specific Printers</P>
 <P class="support" style="margin-left:36.00pt;">This registry option has been available for some time but was not released by programming for documentation until now.  This registry should only be used if a certain printer consistently ‘chops off’ the left-hand (or top line) of SAM Pro reports and no other remedy is available. Note that this entry must be used with caution as bitmaps associated with the report (e.g., invoices and purphase orders) are NOT repositioned, when may lead to lose of proper alignment; adding whitespace to the graphic may correct this issue. It is up to the support person to ensure that all reports print in a satisfactory manner with this entry in place. </P>

 <P class="support" style="margin-left:36.00pt;">where printername is the name of the printer exactly as it appears in the Name field of the Windows Printer dialog box. Please note that this field is upper/lower case sensitive. If this entry is specific to a user, the branch must be specified if a user belongs to a branch.

 <P class="support" style="margin-left:36.00pt;">Encon has the following situation on a regular basis ... the Quantity Used (as recorded in Tech Anywhere) is less than the Quantity Requisitioned.&nbsp; As noted above, in this scenario, the Import Wizard recognizes the difference and imports the additional quantity required to match up to the requisitions.</P>
 <P class="support" style="margin-left:36.00pt;">Per Tim's request, this behavior is being changed as follows ... instead of resolving quantity differences, the import wizard simply looks for WO-INV Item/Location combinations that match up with requisitions.&nbsp; Quantity differences are no longer relevant.&nbsp; This includes the situation where a WO-INV line exists for a given Item/Location combination and the line's Quantity is zero.</P>
 <P class="support" style="margin-left:36.00pt;">That last statement is important because current Tech Anywhere posting rules will post zero-quantity lines that are uploaded from a tech device.&nbsp; This permits the tech to indicate that zero were used.</P>

 <P class="support" >Sometimes users create &quot;fictitious&quot; techs to use as place holders for unassigned work orders. For example, users put a tech called PM on their D-Boards and park the PM Work Orders there for later assignment. Since the tech &quot;PM&quot; isn't a valid SageQuest driver the work order wouldn't show on the SageQuest map. This new registry setting will cause any tech listed just like the work order had no tech (unassigned) on it and since SageQuest displays unassigned work orders the PM work orders would show up with a blank tech id.</P>

In Sep 2005, the Service Account Manager was added to Site Equipment record.&nbsp; Unfortunately, New Call was never made aware of this option.&nbsp; Further confusing things is the fact that the Service Account Manager field has become an input field in New Call that does understand the possibility that the manager might be assigned from the Equipment record.</P>
 <P class="support" >The software has been re-coded so that the value the user sees in the input field is based on these rules:<BR>&nbsp;a.

 <P class="support" >2643 &nbsp;UserReport2 processing</P>
 <P class="support" >In previous releases, UserReport2 had problems when accessing the text column of the notes table. This is because the notes column can contain cr characters (or maybe it is the lf character that is causing the problem). FieldTableCursor does not handle such columns properly as it assumes that the cr character identifies the end of the row. The result is that FieldTableCursor may return multiple rows where only a single row is actually present in the table. Since the Report Writer relies on FieldTableCursor, it can error out when accessing the notes.text column.</P>

 <P class="support" >In previous releases, in a GL Report Row Layout definition, a DefineTot row defines a total account whose sign depends on whether the computed total is a net Debit or a net Credit. Net Debits generate a positive total and net Credits generate a negative total. This is regardless of the value of the Sign Control field on the DefineTot row. This results, for example, in a net Income total always generating a negative total. This can lead to percentages of net income showing up with an improper sign.</P>

This report will be ordered by the Tax Authority Id first, and the Sort Employees By option within each Taxing Authority.  A summary page will be produced for each taxing authority.

 <P class="support" >If a single custom help document exists for a function, but standard SAM Pro help is not implemented for it, the document will now automatically open instead of displaying a list consisting of the custom help. </P>
 <P class="support" >Example: assume that a user-defined report function does not have custom help.&nbsp; Since the Help Code is 0, there isn't any real help to show.&nbsp; However, when I create my own Help Document and attach it to the function, I don't want to see a list pop up with my custom help and the generic help for code 0.&nbsp; What I really want is that my custom doc is displayed without any intermediate documents list. The system will now do this.</P>
