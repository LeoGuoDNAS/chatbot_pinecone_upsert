<h1>Bank Reconciliation Journal</h1>
<h2>Purpose:</h2>
<p>This function enables you to reconcile your GL Accounts with the statement 
 that you receive from your bank. It also enables you to record interest 
 income and fee expense without having to make separate GL entries.</p>
<p style="margin-left: 36.00pt;"><font style="font-weight: bold;">Tip: 
 Bank Reconciliation Report<br/>
</font>Run the Bank Reconciliation Report to ensure that all transactions 
 have been recorded. The report details beginning and ending bank balances 
 for a specified account- compare it to your bank statement before starting 
 the Bank Reconciliation Journal to be sure your starting balance is correct. 
 Also run the report after your Bank Reconciliation is complete to be sure 
 your ending balance is correct.</p>
<p>The Bank Reconciliation Journal supports Intercompany Processing:</p>
<p style="margin-left: 48px;">1. GL Entity Ids are required for Interco 
 customizations.<br/>
2. All entities must reference the same Company when intercompany is ON.<br/>
3. The system posts Company Security Rn to GLH Security Rn when intercompany 
 is ON.</p>
<h2>Usage:</h2>
<p>If you track more than one account, a reconciliation entry should be 
 done for each.</p>
<p class="Block_Text" style="font-weight: bold;">Do not use the Clear Checks 
 Function when Bank Reconciliation is used, since the function sets the 
 clear date. Voided Checks will not be loaded into the Reconciliation viewer; 
 they are already reconciled based on the fact that they have been voided.</p>
<p class="Block_Text">The Delete Record and Delete Line are not available 
 in this Journal to avoid inadvertent deletions by the user. If you must 
 change an entry, note that blanking the CL box on a Check entry will blank 
 the Date Reconciled in the Check record so that the check will once again 
 be eligible for reconciliation.</p>
<p>The system allows an unbalanced transaction to be saved, but does not 
 post it to GL. Once the transaction is completed and balanced, it will 
 be posted to GL when it is saved. The system will prevent a new entry 
 for the same GL Account/Entity if an unreconciled entry is found.</p>
<p><span>Existing Bank Reconciliation transaction may qualify as eligible 
 for edit, provided the edit won’t undermine or conflict with a more recent 
 transaction.  This means that transactions may be “undone” via 
 edit in reverse transaction id sequence in order to work backwards to 
 address an issues in Bank Reconciliation transactions prior to just the 
 last one posted versus previously when ONLY that last transaction posted 
 could be edited.</span></p>


<h2>Registries:</h2>
<p><span>A <a href="Registry_Bank_Reconciliation_Journal.htm">registry</a> 
 is available to always set new checks lines to not cleared when in Add 
 Mode.</span></p>
<h2>Range Viewer:</h2>
<p>Since multiple GL accounts are present in the ‘parent’ tab of this journal, 
 simple range filters (where you enter the GL Account Id) will not work 
 for these &quot;encapsulated&quot; fields. To enable the user to filter 
 on a specific parent GL Account, special filter ranges with the necessary 
 SQL to filter on a specific GL Account have been added for the GL Bank 
 Account Id:, GL Fees Account Id: and GL Interest Account Id:. When you 
 first access the Range screen, the GL Bank Account range will be completed 
 as follows:</p>
<p><font style="font-weight: bold;">GL Bank Account Id:<br/>
</font>sql= gl_bnk_glaccnt_rn in (select glaccnt_rn from glaccnt where 
 glaccnt_id like &#39;%&#39;)</p>
<p>Suppose that your firm uses more than one Bank Account. To filter Entries 
 for a specific GL Bank Account, simply replace the % in the SQL statement 
 with the GL Bank Account Id you wish to filter on. For example, to filter 
 on the GL Bank Account Id 1005, simply change the SQL statement in the 
 range to:</p>
<p>sql= gl_bnk_glaccnt_rn in (select glaccnt_rn from glaccnt where glaccnt_id 
 like &#39;<font style="font-weight: bold;">1005</font>&#39;)</p>
<p>Tip: Saving Ranges</p>
<p>Rather than adjust the SQL statement each time you use the filter, you 
 may save your settings as a range. See <a href="Filter_Button.htm#Filter_Save_Range">Save 
 Filter Range</a> for details.</p>
<h2>Important Fields: Upper Section</h2>
<p><font style="font-weight: bold;">Period Id:<br/>
</font>The Accounting Period to which this reconciliation is assigned. 
 The system validates that the Accounting Period is Active before allowing 
 the user to continue with the reconciliation.</p>
<p><font style="font-weight: bold;">Effective Date:<br/>
</font>The Effective Date of the reconciliation. This date must fall within 
 the date range of the accounting period.</p>
<p><img src="assets/images/image/AutoFillP.gif" alt="image\AutoFillP.gif" title="image\AutoFillP.gif" width="94" height="28" align="left" border="0"/> When the fields 
 in the upper section of this screen are completed, click this button to 
 automatically populate the tabs in the lower section of the screen.</p>
<p>All auto-fill actions are based on the Effective Date; checks, deposits 
 and transfers dated after the Effective Date you enter will not be imported.</p>
<p>If the user clicks the Auto Fill button in an existing entry the system 
 asks “Retain previously record reconciliation info?”. If Yes is clicked, 
 the system will merge existing transaction lines with any un-reconciled 
 lines that are discovered. If No is clicked, existing transaction lines 
 will be replaced by all un-reconciled lines, enabling you to effectively 
 restart the entry.</p>
<p><font style="font-weight: bold;">GL Bank Account:</font></p>
<p><font style="font-weight: bold;">GL Account:<br/>

  All entities must reference the same Company when intercompany is

 and Entity Validations:</span><br/>
Validation denies a change to the GL Account or Entity fields when the 
 viewer is not in Add mode.</p>
<p style="margin-left: 48px;">If the viewer is in Add mode, changing the 
 GL Account and/or Entity fields will automatically clear all child lines; 
  this forces the user to Auto-Fill for the currently selected GL 
 Account/Entity combination.</p>
<p><font style="font-weight: bold;">Interest Account:</font></p>
<p><font style="font-weight: bold;">GL Account:<br/>
</font>The Income Account to be credited with the Total Interest Earned. 
 The system verifies that the GL Account Type is set to Normal. A warning

 Category is not set to &#39;Income&#39; for this account.</p>
<p><font style="font-weight: bold;">GL Entity:<br/>

 ON.</p>
