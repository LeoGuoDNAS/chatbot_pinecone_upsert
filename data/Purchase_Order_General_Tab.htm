<h1>Purchase Order General Tab</h1>
<p>This tab should be used to record non-inventory materials, freight and 
 other charges.</p>
<p style="margin-left: 48px;"><font style="font-weight: bold;">Lines Imported 
 to Work Order<br/>
</font>The system displays a warning if user attempts to change lines imported 
 to a work order including the following:  </p>
<p style="margin-left: 88px;">1. deleting the line<br/>
2. cancelling the line<br/>
3. changing either the quantity ordered or received to something less than 
 the quantity imported.</p>
<p style="margin-left: 36.00pt;">The Quantity Imported into the WO is displayed 
 on the detail view.</p>
<h2>Important Fields:</h2>
<p><font style="font-weight: bold;">Qty:</font><br/>
The quantity of the item being ordered. This field cannot be changed if 
 the status is Pending Cancel or Cancelled. The quantity cannot be changed 
 to less than the quantity of this item already received on this purchase 
 order.</p>
<p><font style="font-weight: bold;">QtyRcvd:</font><br/>
In most cases, the Inventory Receipts Journal should be used to received 
 items. However, if this Purchase Order is being issued to record a transaction 
 that has already taken place (e.g., a technician has purchased a part 
 from the local hardware store), then enter the quantity that was already 
 received. If you are receiving items directly on this PO, verify that 
 the Accounting Period Id field is completed in the upper section of this 
 viewer.</p>
<p>A registry may be enabled to <a href="Registry_Entry_Purchase_Order.htm#Auto_Receive_Credit_PO">Auto 
 Receive Credit POs</a> only. </p>
<p style="margin-left: 36.00pt;"><font style="font-weight: bold;">Note:</font> 
 <font style="font-weight: bold;">&quot;Unreceiving&quot; items</font><font style="font-weight: bold;"><br/>
</font>The user is warned if a line is &#39;unreceived&#39; after it has been imported 
 into a work order. If the user changes the quantity received, the system 
 will display the message:</p>
<p style="margin-left: 36.00pt;">Warning: this line was imported in Work 
 Order ######</p>
<p style="margin-left: 36.00pt;">Are you sure you want to change the received 
 quantity?</p>
<p style="margin-left: 36.00pt;">It the user answers ‘Yes’, the box will 
 clear. If he answers ‘No’, an information box will appear asking him to 
 press Shift-Home to restore the original value.</p>
<p style="margin-left: 36.00pt;"><font style="font-weight: bold;">Note: 
 Unvouchered Payables<br/>
</font>if Unvouchered Payables are implemented on your system, the Unvouchered 
 Payable GL accounts must be entered in all applicable Inventory Group 
 records.</p>
<p><font style="font-weight: bold;">Description:</font><br/>
This field is required to ensure the integrity of the data when making 
 AP and PO Receipts Journal entries. Note that Description fields must 
 be unique within each Purchase Order (i.e., you cannot have two lines 
 on the General tab with a Description of Misc, or a line on the General 
 tab and a line on the Subcontractor tab with a Description of Misc).</p>
<p><font style="font-weight: bold;">Unit Cost:</font> (numeric format 0000000.000)<br/>
Enter the Unit Cost of the item at the time of order (alternately, enter 
 the Extended Cost and press Enter to have the system calculate the Unit 
 Cost for you). If the Currency Id field is completed on the Main Tab, 
 all costs MUST be entered in the Vendor’s currency.</p>
<p><font style="font-weight: bold;">Extended Cost:</font><br/>
The Unit Cost X Qty. This field is calculated by the system when you enter 
 the Quantity and the Unit Cost.</p>
<p><font style="font-weight: bold;">Other Rate Id:</font><br/>
Other rates enable you to assign a billing attribute (unit price or markup) 
 to items that are not inventory material (which use material markup) and 
 are not labor (uses labor table). This optional field should be completed 
 if this item will ultimately be billed to one of your clients.</p>
<p><font style="font-weight: bold;">Workorder Id:</font><br/>
This field defaults from the WO Id on the Main PO tab. If a WO Id is filled 
 in, the Job, Cost Code, and Billing Item fields will also default. Note 
 that a Purchase Order may be imported into a Work Order by clicking the 
 Import Costs button on the Work Order. If this field is completed, it 
 will be referenced on the printed PO instead of the Job Id.</p>
<p><font style="font-weight: bold;">Equipment Id:<br/>
</font>If the user enters a Work Order Id, the system will default in the 
 first piece of equipment on the Work Order’s Equipment tab UNLESS this 
 behavior is disabled via registry (see <a href="Registry_Entry_Global_Settings__Column_Compression__Dispatch_Board_Rows__History_Log_Inventory_Markup.htm#global_settings_journal_equipment_id">Registry 
 Option - Do Not Default Equipment Id</a>). If the user double clicks on 
 this field, the system will display a list of all equipment associated 
 with the Client Site referenced in the Work Order.</p>
<p>If the sys-ffv-global setting &#39;DefaultEquipmentFromWorkorder&#39; is set 
 to false, the user is allowed to set the Equipment Id back to blank. If 
 this registry option is not present or set to true, the Equipment Id must 
 be completed if a Work Order Id is referenced.</p>
<p><font style="font-weight: bold;">Job Id:</font><br/>
The Job (if any) this item is being ordered for; this field defaults from 
 the Job Id (or the WO&#39;s Job) on the Main tab.</p>
<p><font style="font-weight: bold;">Job Cost Code Id:</font>  <font style="font-weight: bold;">Job Bill Itm Id:</font>  <font style="font-weight: bold;">Job 
 Cost Category:</font><br/>
If a Job Id is specified, these fields must be filled in with the appropriate 
 Job Cost Category, Job Cost Code, and Billing Item Id&#39;s. The 
 Job Cost Category will be cleared if a Job is NOT specified when the record 
 is saved or loaded.</p>
<p>The Cost Category supports enhanced 
 filtering provided by the Cost Code&#39;s Job Cost Category Usage Filter. 
 Cost Categories are validated (relative to Cost Codes) during data entry 
 upon leaving the Cost Category Id field.  The full relationship is 
 validated again when leaving a child line or saving a record.</p>
<p>Cost Categories with Selection Types 
 of Material, Other, Subcontract and Equipment are allowed. The user is 
 warned if a Labor Cost Category is selected.</p>
<p><font style="font-weight: bold;">GL Account</font><br/>
If this item is being purchased to a job or miscellaneous, enter the appropriate 
 GL expense account to debit. If this item is being purchased for inventory, 
 enter the appropriate inventory asset account to debit. The display-only 
 GL Account Name field defaults from the GL Account record.</p>
<p><font style="font-weight: bold;">GL Entity:</font><br/>
The Id of the GL Entity to be affected by this transaction; this field 
 should default from the Job Cost Code (for items bought to a Job or Work 
 Order) or from the Location&#39;s GL Entity.</p>
<p style="margin-left: 48px;"><span style="font-weight: bold;">WARNING:</span> 
  If the GL Entity is entered on the &#39;misc&#39; Inventory Group it will 
 override the Entity in the Job Cost Code (which is typically the one you 
 want) when a line is entered.</p>





<p><font style="font-weight: bold;">Vendor&#39;s Part #:</font><br/>
The Vendor&#39;s Part number for this item.</p>
<p><font style="font-weight: bold;">U-M:</font><br/>
The Unit of Measure (e.g., each, ft, lb).</p>
<p><font style="font-weight: bold;">Date Requested:</font><br/>
The date you are requesting the item; defaults from the corresponding field 
 in the header section of the PO when the Quantity field is completed.</p>
<p><font style="font-weight: bold;">Date Promised:</font><br/>
The date the Vendor promised the item; defaults from the corresponding 
 field in the header section of the PO when the Quantity field is completed.</p>
<p><font style="font-weight: bold;">Cancel?</font><br/>
Flag this field if this item only is to be cancelled. A line cannot be 
 cancelled if items have been received, if the line status is New, or the 
 PO has a status of Cancelled or Closed.</p>
<p><img src="assets/images/image/Magnify.gif" alt="" style="border: none;" border="0"/> 
 Click the Magnify button to see the following fields.</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: bold;">Billable 
 Quantity:</span><br/>
This field supports the scenario where 
 a TechAnywhere technician changes the Billable Quantity of an item so 
 that it will be correctly imported into the Work Order. By default this 
 field is set from the Job Quantity Ordered.  </p>
<p style="margin-left: 8px;"><font style="font-weight: bold;"><span style="font-weight: bold;">E</span>xtended 
 Description<br/>
<span style="font-weight: normal;">This</span> o</font>ptional, 1200 character 
 field will be printed on the Purchase Order if completed.</p>
<p style="margin-left: 8px;"><span style="font-weight: bold;">Extra:</span><br/>
If the Job Billing Item on this line is Fixed Fee / Allow Extras, this 
 box must be checked to enable the calculation of the Amount Revenue field.</p>
<p><font style="font-weight: bold;">Billing Type Id:  Revenue Rate:</font><br/>
These fields will be completed if this line pertains to a Work Order or 
 Job, and are jointly determined by the Other Rate Id and the Job&#39;s Rate 
 Schedule.</p>
<p><font style="font-weight: bold;">Unit Price:</font><br/>
The Unit Price (to be charged to the customer) for this line, based on 
 the Unit Cost, Bill Type Id, and Revenue rate.</p>
<p><font style="font-weight: bold;">Amount Revenue:</font><br/>
The price that will appear ultimately appear on the customer&#39;s invoice 
 (Unit Price x Quantity), less any applicable discounts. This field will 
 be set when the Job Quantity Received is completed (not equal to zero).</p>
<p><font style="font-weight: bold;">Tax Group Id:  </font><span style="font-weight: bold;">Tax 
 Cost:</span> <span style="font-weight: bold;"><font style="font-weight: bold;">T</font>ax 
 Type Id:</span><span style="font-weight: bold;"><br/>
</span>The Tax Group Id  field will default from the Tax Group Id 
 on the Purchase Order’s Main tab (if it is completed). If the Tax Group 
 Id is not set on the Main tab, this field will default from the Job record 
 (if specified). The Tax Group specified in this field is used to calculate 
 the use tax cost for items entered on this tab.</p>
<p><font style="font-weight: bold;">Line Status:<br/>
</font> <font style="font-weight: bold;">Quantity Needed: Quantity Received: 
 Quantity Vouchered:<br/>
Date of Last Receipt: Received Cost:<br/>
</font>These display-only fields are maintained by the system.</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: bold;">TechAnywhere Source Rn: Technician Id</span><br/>
If these fields are completed, this record/line was created/revised from 
 TechAnywhere.</p>
