<h1>AR Cash Receipts OpenEdge / Global Payments Processing</h1>
<p>If you have established a MOTO account with OpenEdge / Global Payments, 
 you may process a credit card payment or 
 refund in the AR Cash Receipts Journal once your registry 
 and servers have been correctly configured (see <a href="Registry_Payment_Processor_APT_Accelerated_Payment_Technology.htm">Open 
 Edge Registry</a>).</p>
<p style="margin-left: 48px;"><span style="font-weight: bold;">Note:</span> 
 Edits and deletions to AR lines for Credit Card paid entries are not allowed 
 for Full users. Only Special (support) users are allowed to edit or delete. </p>
<h3>Processing Payments</h3>
<p>Click <a href="#Processing_Credit_Refunds">Processing 
 Credit Refunds</a> for details on issuing credits.</p>
<p>1. If you use a different sweep account for OpenEdge payments, change 
 the Bank Account on the GL tab.</p>
<p>2. On the Main tab, select Invoice or Invoices that the customer wishes 
 to pay for.</p>
<p>3. Enter the Discount (if any) and Total Receipt; this is the amount 
 that will be processed on the credit card.</p>
<p><img src="assets/images/Process Payment.bmp" alt="" style="border: none;" border="0"/></p>
<p>4. Verify that the customer has their credit card ready, and then click 
 the Process Payment button.</p>
<p class="MsoNormal">If 
 your firm is set up for Payment Processing and an Invoice or Invoices 
 have been selected for payment, the following happens when the Process 
 Payments button is clicked:</p>
<p class="MsoNormal" style="margin-left: .5in;">Determine 
 the Client Site associated with each Invoice that has been selected for 
 payment in the transaction being recorded.</p>
<p class="MsoNormal" style="margin-left: .5in;">If 
 an eligible alias token is NOT found, SAMPro will simply display a message 
 reminding you that you will only have 60 seconds to enter the information; 
 click Yes to continue.  </p>
<p class="MsoNormal" style="margin-left: .5in;">If 
 one or more Aliases are found, the system will display a list of the eligible 
 Payment Alias/Token values found in the above list of Sites.  To 
 be eligible, a Site&#39;s Alias/Token must have an expiration date greater 
 than or equal to the current system date. </p>
<p class="MsoNormal" style="margin-left: 88px;">If 
 <b>No Selection</b> is highlighted and the Select button clicked SAMPro 
 will display a message reminding you that you will only have 60 seconds 
 to enter the information; click Yes to continue.  Another message 
 informs you that the journal entry will be added before Payment Processing; 
 click Yes again.  </p>
<p class="MsoNormal" style="margin-left: 88px;">If 
 an <b>existing Alias</b> is highlighted and the Select button clicked, 
 the system will send the information to Open Edge; if approved, the Credit 
 Card fields will be completed and the Cash Receipt saved.</p>
<p class="MsoNormal" style="margin-left: 88px;">If 
 the <b>Cancel</b> or red X button is clicked, the list will be closed 
 SAMPro will display a message reminding you that you will only have 60 
 seconds to enter the information; click Yes to continue or Cancel to opt 
 out of the payment processing.</p>
<p>5. If an existing alias was not selected, 
 SAMPro will display a message reminding you that you will 
 only have 60 seconds to enter the information; click Yes to continue. 
  Another message inform you that the journal entry will be added 
 before Payment Processing; click Yes again.  </p>
<p>6. When the X-Web or SAMPro&#39;s Credit 
 Card Information for Tokenization portal opens, enter the 
 customer&#39;s credit card number (without spaces or dashes) and expiration 
 date and click Submit. If the Credit 
 Card Information for Tokenization portal is being used, be sure that the 
 Country field is completed before clicking Submit. </p>
<p>7. If the card is approved, the web portal will display &quot;Approval&quot; 
 in red. If it is not approved, check the number and expiration date and 
 try submitting it again.</p>
<p style="margin-left: 48px;">In Open 
 Edge / Global Payments, you can process a card (payment or alias) and 
 get an Approval + an error attached. In previous releases, SAMPro treated 
 this scenario as a failed transaction, but in reality the transaction 
 had been approved and showed on the OpenEdge Merchant site <span style="font-weight: bold; 
	 font-style: italic;">if</span> the Open Edge account was set up to 
 approve transactions with these issues. SAMPro now treats the following 
 as Approved:</p>
<p style="margin-left: 48px;">Approved 
 - AVS &amp; CSC Mismatch<br/>
Approved - AVS Mismatch<br/>
Approved - CSC Mismatch</p>
<p style="margin-left: 48px;">Note that 
 an AVS Mismatch occurs if the billing address does not match the address 
 on file with the card-issuing bank or credit card company.  A CSC 
 Mismatch occurs if the Card Security Code does not match.  </p>
<p>8. When the payment is approved, the system will write the Approval 
 Code back to the Check Number field, and complete the CC Masked Account 
 field for future reference.</p>
<p style="margin-left: 48px;">Timing Out: If the Alias is not generated 
 within 60 seconds, it will not be written back to SAMPro, even if a success 
 is noted in the web portal.  If this occurs, repeat the Alias process.</p>
<p style="margin-left: 8px;">9. When preparing to enter the next Cash Receipt, 
 remember to set the GL Bank Account to the appropriate value.</p>
<p style="margin-left: 48px;">Note: For Cash Receipt Transactions, SAMPro 
 will also send the SAMPro user ID to column &quot;User ID&quot; of export, 
 and sent the User Def 1 to the Client Id.</p>
<h3><a name="Processing_Credit_Refunds" id="Processing_Credit_Refunds"></a>Processing 
 Credit Refunds</h3>
<p>1. Select a Credit Memo in the AR Cash 
 Receipts Journal, and enter the Total Receipt as a negative number.</p>
<p>2. Verify that the customer has their 
 credit card ready, and then click the Process Payment button.</p>
<p>3. Click through the usual messages; 
 when the x-web portal opens, enter the customer&#39;s credit card number (without 
 spaces or dashes) and expiration date and click Submit.</p>
<p>4. If the card is approved, the web 
 portal will display &quot;Approval&quot; in red and the customer&#39;s card 
 will be credited with the refund.  If it is not approved, check the 
 number and expiration date and try submitting it again.</p>
