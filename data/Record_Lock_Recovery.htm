<h1>Record Lock Recovery</h1>
<p>SAMPro Version 9.1.611.053a and above provides a recovery process to 
 resolve temporary record locks for MS SQL Server databases; this functionality 
 is not supported for Sybase databases. When a record lock condition is 
 encountered, a dialog box will be displayed. See the sample below.</p>
<p class="Support"><img src="assets/images/recordlock.png" alt="" style="border: none;" width="594" height="321" border="0"/></p>
<p>The dialog box will include information as to the user who is holding 
 the lock. This gives the locked out user a chance to confer with the locking 
 user who may be able to resolve the situation. If the user does not have 
 permission to obtain the lock information, an appropriate message will 
 be displayed instead of the lock information itself.</p>
<p>The dialog box contains 3 buttons:</p>
<p style="margin-left: 48px;">‘Try Again’. When selected, the dialog box 
 will disappear, and the query will be attempted one additional time. </p>
<p style="margin-left: 88px;">If after the attempt, the lock is still in 
 effect, the dialog box will be redisplayed.</p>
<p style="margin-left: 88px;">If, however, the lock has been cleared by 
 the locking user so that the query is now successful, the user will be 
 so notified, and processing will continue as if the lock had never been 
 encountered.</p>
<p style="margin-left: 48px;">‘Try For 60 Seconds’. When selected, the 
 dialog box will disappear, and the query will be repeatedly attempted 
 for approximately 60 seconds.</p>
<p style="margin-left: 88px;">If, after the 60 seconds, the lock is still 
 in effect, the dialog box will be redisplayed.</p>
<p style="margin-left: 88px;">If, however, anytime during the 60 second 
 wait, the lock has been cleared by the locking user so that the query 
 is now successful, the user will be immediately notified, and processing 
 will continue as if the lock had never been encountered.</p>
<p style="margin-left: 48px;">‘Cancel’ (or ‘X-ing’ out the dialog box). 
 The query will be tried 1 more time.</p>
<p style="margin-left: 88px;">If, after the additional try, the lock is 
 still in effect, the query attempt will return a failure status and processing 
 will continue as is currently implemented.</p>
<p style="margin-left: 88px;">If, however, the additional try is successful, 
 the user will be so notified, and processing will continue as if the lock 
 had never been encountered.</p>
