<H1>Version 7.2 Release Notes – 7.2.476.112</H1>
 <P><A href="version_7_2_release_notes.htm#72RecentUpdates">Recent Updates and Enhancements</A>  </P>
 <P>(see page 84 of printed documentation; page 92 of .pdf reader notes)</P>
 <H1>1. System</H1>
 <H2>1.1 Viewers</H2>
 <P>When the Refresh button was clicked,  certain fields (such as the Work Order’s AR Term Code on the COD tab) were not reloaded from current data. All fields are now reloaded when Refresh is clicked. </P>
 <H3>1.1.1 Filter Ranges</H3>
 <P>This release extends the ability to successfully create a named range to history viewers opened at the filter screen.  </P>
 <P>The user has the option of setting a unique background color for fields that are designated as required.&nbsp; This color was also being applied to the form used on the filter screen. Since these fields are not ‘required’ on the filter range view, these ranges will no longer be displayed in the ‘required’ color. </P>
 <P>In previous versions, entering a single tilde ~ by itself in a range field generated a SQL syntax error. The new behavior is to treat the standalone tilde the same as a standalone exclamation point (NOT blank).</P>
 <H2>1.2. Custom Help Documents</H2>
 <P>If a single custom help document exists for a function, but standard SAM Pro help is not implemented for it, the document will now automatically open instead of displaying a list consisting of the custom help.</P>
 <P>Example: assume that a user-defined report function does not have custom help.&nbsp; Since the Help Code is 0, there isn't any real help to show.&nbsp; However, when I create my own Help Document and attach it to the function, I don't want to see a list pop up with my custom help and the generic help for code 0.&nbsp; What I really want is that my custom doc is displayed without any intermediate documents list. The system will now do this.</P>
 <P>Note: in order for the document to open, it may be necessary to associate its extension will the appropriate executable.  See <A href="registry_entry_to_launch_external_apps.htm">Registry Entry to Launch External Apps</A>  for details. </P>
 <H2>1.3 Document Management – QuickAttach</H2>
 <H3>Purpose:</H3>
 <P>QuickAttach lets the user select and archive a file to the existing record they are editing or a new record that has not yet been added (e.g., attaching a previously scanned vendor invoice to an AP entry that you are creating).  In addition, QuickAttach bypasses several of the steps required by the Attachment button when it is used to attach a file.  </P>
 <H3>Registry:</H3>
 <P>See user note 2.1 for the registry entries needed to implement this feature. </P>
 <H3>Usage:</H3>
 <P><IMG src="images/qa.gif" align=left border=0 height=28 width=48 alt="images\qa.gif"> A new Quick Attach sidebar button has been added to all viewer sidebars. If QuickAttach is not enabled for the viewer via registry, the system will warn you that QuickAttach is disabled for this function. </P>
 <P>If QuickAttach is enabled for this viewer, pressing the button opens a browser with the directory to the QuickAttachOpenPath (defined via registry), and then shows all files in that directory. </P>
 <P>Once you select a file Windows will open the appropriate viewer (e.g., MS Paint, or the Adobe Reader). If the correct file is selected, the user should click Open, and the name file will be stored in the FFV settings cache as quickAttach_(functionid).</P>
 <P>When the viewer tries to add or change the record, the system checks to see if an attachment has been cached.  If so, the user is asked ‘ Would you like to attach referenced file’.  Pressing Yes:</P>
 <P style="margin-left:36.00pt;">- Quick attaches the file by creating a new document record that references the new or existing record (as well as any other DocumentReferences. (PO, Vendor, Job, WO, etc) from the transaction) </P>
 <P style="margin-left:36.00pt;">- AND deletes the attached file from the QuickAttachOpenPath directory </P>
 <P>Pressing No simply clears the cache: the file is not deleted from the QuickAttachOpenPath directory, and is also not attached to the record.</P>
 <P style="margin-left:36.00pt;"><FONT style="font-weight:bold; " >Quick Attach</FONT><FONT style="font-weight:bold; " >ing toJournal Entries</FONT><FONT style="font-weight:bold; " >:</FONT> <BR>This function supports multiple workorders/jobs in journal entries. For example, when using QA in the labor journal, the document will be attached to the employee, the journal, the pay period, and ALL Work Order/Jobs referenced in the labor journal entry.  </P>
 <P style="margin-top:0;margin-bottom:0">&nbsp;</P>
 <H2>1.4 Document Management </H2>
 <P>This release corrects an obscure issue when emailing file attachments as part of a Scheduled Event.</P>
 <P>The Archive File Location and Type fields in the Document Record are now successfully completed during the scanning process. </P>
 <H3>1.4.1 Create .PDF</H3>
 <P><IMG src="images/createpdf.gif" align=left border=0 height=28 width=48 alt="images\createpdf.gif"> A new button, Create PDF, has been added to the side button bar of the Document list view. The purpose of this button is to enable the user to create a multipage PDF file out of the attached document files appearing on the list. The following file types may be combined into this PDF: .bmp, .jpg, .pdf, and .dbr (Data-Basics report files). In addition, the create PDF button also supports use with archived documents tagged as ‘Read Only’. </P>
 <P>For example, suppose you needed to print all your scanned invoices for selected vendors for sales tax auditing purposes.&nbsp; If the original hard copies were no longer available, the user would simply filter the document list to that vendor's scanned invoices and then create the PDF for the auditor or to print.</P>
 <P>To use this feature: </P>
 <P>1. Filter the Document list to the set of documents that should be combined.</P>
 <P>2. Push the Create PDF button.&nbsp;A browser window will appear.  Select a location for your file to be saved to, and enter a new filename for it (note that the extension, .pdf, is already completed for you. </P>
 <P>3. Click the Open button.  Files that can be converted to PDF (currently BMP, JPG, PDF and DBR) will be combined into a single PDF in the same order that the files appear in the pick list.</P>
 <P>4. The PDF file will be opened for you in the Adobe reader window.  At this point, you may print the PDF file. </P>
 <P style="margin-left:36.00pt;"><FONT style="font-weight:bold; " >Note:</FONT> this new PDF will <FONT style="font-weight:bold; " >NOT</FONT> be archived with your other SAM Pro documents unless you attach it to the appropriate SAM Pro record. </P>
 <H3>1.4.2 Document Viewer</H3>
 <P>The View Documents filter now includes ranges for Table Name, Reference Id and Reference Name.  These ranges are also included on the document list for a record’s attachments. </P>
 <P>A sort option has been added to the Document viewer (as accessed from View Document, not a record’s attachments). The new option is DocumentByReferenceId, with the columns: </P>
 <P>&nbsp;Reference Id-Reference Name-Category-Description-Date Logged-Document Id</P>
 <P>This release also corrects a system primitive error that occurred in View Documents if you changed the sort order in the KeyNames pane and then clicked the Create .PDF button. </P>
 <H3>1.4.3 Start Document Archive Maintenance</H3>
 <P>This function has been enhanced to update document records where the Archive File Location and File type fields were not set. This will enable the Create PDF button to successfully find these documents. It is recommended that this function be run periodically. </P>
 <H2>1.5 Report Viewer – Auto-Scrolling</H2>
 <P>This functionality applies when displaying SAMPRO reports if the registry option described in user note 2.4 is implemented.  Vertical scrolling is now capable of automatically advancing to the 'next page' once the user has scrolled to the bottom of the current page.&nbsp; Similar functionality exists for upward scrolling and automatically moving to the 'previous page'.</P>
 <H2>1.6 Obsolete Record Management</H2>
 <P><FONT style="font-weight:bold; " >New Field: Obsolete<BR></FONT>By default, this field not checked. If it is checked, the record is considered Obsolete: </P>
 <P style="margin-left:36.00pt;">1. Validation logic denies entry of obsolete record Ids.&nbsp; Note that this logic only applies when the user enters an Id value directly into the Id's input field.&nbsp; Ids that are entered indirectly (default in from other records) are not currently treated as errors.</P>
 <P style="margin-left:36.00pt;">2. Obsoleted records can be edited and the Obsolete option can be un-done when necessary. </P>
 <P style="margin-left:36.00pt;">3. Type-ahead logic acts as though obsolete records do not exist.</P>
 <P>When you check the Obsolete field, the following message box will be displayed:</P>
 <P style="margin-left:36.00pt;">“You have elected to obsolete this record.  Would you like to see existing references to this record?”</P>
 <P style="margin-left:36.00pt;">If you click Yes, the system will display a viewer that provides click-through access to all tables referencing this record.  See User Note 1.7.  </P>
 <P style="margin-left:36.00pt;"><FONT style="font-weight:bold; " >Tip:</FONT> The Referenced In list may also be generated from the menu bar’s Tools – Referenced By option. </P>
 <P><FONT style="font-weight:bold; " >New Filter Range: Obsolete</FONT></P>
 <P>This new filter range will default to N so that only records that are not obsolete will appear. Clearing the filter displays both obsolete and non-obsolete records; enter a Y to display only Obsolete records. </P>
 <P><FONT style="font-weight:bold; " >Records Enabled:<BR></FONT>The Obsolete field and the corresponding filter range has been added to the following records. </P>
 <P>Account Manager&nbsp;<BR>Branch&nbsp;&nbsp;<BR>Call Script<BR>Certification&nbsp;<BR>Deduction&nbsp;<BR>Deduction Group<BR>Discipline&nbsp;&nbsp;<BR>Dispatcher<BR>Earnings &nbsp;&nbsp;<BR>Earning Groups<BR>Equipment Type&nbsp;&nbsp;<BR>Estimator&nbsp;&nbsp;<BR>Flat Rate Categories<BR>GL Accounts&nbsp;&nbsp;<BR>GL Entity (<FONT style="font-weight:bold; " >Note:</FONT> the<FONT style="font-weight:bold; " > </FONT>GL Entity Status field was previously used to indicate Active(Y) or Not Active(N).&nbsp;<BR>&nbsp;During data conversion, the system now uses its opposite value as a default for the new Obsolete field)<BR>Insurance Type&nbsp;&nbsp;<BR>Job Cost Category&nbsp;<BR>Job Type<BR>Labor Rate Id&nbsp;&nbsp;<BR>Labor Rate Table<BR>Location&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<BR>Log Form<BR>Market Source&nbsp;&nbsp;<BR>Material Rate Table&nbsp;&nbsp;<BR>Milestones<BR>Other Rate Id<BR>Other Rate Table<BR>Pay Type<BR>Price Code<BR>Project<BR>Project Manager<BR>Project Principal<BR>Purchase Manager<BR>Rate Schedule<BR>Sales Rep<BR>Service Account Manager<BR>Service Category<BR>Service Parts<BR>Service Task<BR>Service Zone<BR>Work Code</P>
 <H2>1.7 Record References</H2>
 <H3>Purpose:</H3>
 <P>This viewer allows you to access and maintain your data by accessing the records that reference (point to) the record you launch this viewer from. </P>
 <P style="margin-left:36.00pt;"><FONT style="font-weight:bold; text-decoration:underline;" >Example:<BR></FONT>Suppose you flag the Obsolete box in the Account Manager record for Bob Jones. The system will display a list of tables (records) that reference the Account Manager Bob Jones so that you can change to a different Account Manager. The Row Count Column lists the total number of records referencing this Account Manager. The Account Manager can be referenced by the Client, Client Order, Client Site, Client SiteEquipment, MasterContract, and WorkOrder records.  Typically, you would want to change the Account Manager in your static records (Client, Site and Equipment). </P>
 <H3>Usage:</H3>
 <P>The References viewer is displayed when a user checks the Obsolete box, or selects References from the Tools menu.  </P>
 <H3>Important Fields:</H3>
 <P>The References viewer will display a list of tables (records) that reference the specific record that you invoked it from. This record will appear in the top border of the Viewer. </P>
 <P><FONT style="font-weight:bold; " >TableName  ChildtableName  DataBaseColumnName<BR></FONT>The Viewer / Tab that references the record you launched this viewer from. </P>
 <P>Double-click on a line to display a filtered list of this type of records. The record id range will be set the References function so that only active records will appear. If, for some reason you needed to view inactive records pointing to your original record, click the Filter button and adjust any Closed/Inactive/Obsolete ranges as needed.  </P>
 <P><FONT style="font-weight:bold; " >RowCount<BR></FONT>The Row Count Column lists the total number of records of this type referencing the record. </P>
 <H2>1.8 Archiving auto-saved reports </H2>
 <P>Previously, invoices and some other reports (which displayed the 'did this report print correctly' box) did not archive when used in conjunction with the olddialog registry option (such as in 'sys-printer-dialog-rcopinvce' This has been corrected so that ‘olddialog’ works correctly with report archiving. </P>
 <P>This release includes changes to prevent sporadic problems with service invoices not being archived. Assorted fixes, including the requirement that all unsaved changes be resolved before the use logs out or switches security. &quot;Exit not allowed while open viewers have unsaved changes&quot; will be displayed if changes to any viewers must be confirmed or abandoned.</P>
 <P>This fix addresses the scenario where SAMPRO reports were being created, auto-saved and archived with the Overwrite option set to true, the old file(s) weren’t being deleted from the archive folder; this has been corrected. In this final tweak in this image, the specific case of reprinting a PO (where lines were added, but the PO was not saved as a change order) is now properly handled. </P>
 <H2>1.9 Document Scanning </H2>
 <P>The user is now prompted to enter a Document Category in the final Scan Wizard window. </P>
 <P>The Document Scanning Wizard now also allows the user to set the 'viewable' options for the document. The following fields have been added to the final screen of the Wizard:</P>
 <P>&nbsp;Web Viewable CRM?   Web Viewable CSR?  Web Viewable Tech?</P>
 <P>The user should check one or more boxes if this document should be viewable in CRMAnywhere, CSRAnywhere, or TechAnywhere. </P>
 <H2>1.10 Required Fields</H2>
 <P>This version corrects a problem where required fields did not display correctly for textbox fields.</P>
 <H2>1.11 User Accounts</H2>
 <P>Improvements<FONT style="font-weight:bold; " > </FONT>to Active / Inactive filtering in the User list view. </P>
 <P>This release corrects a problem editing a User Id if the number of active users equaled those allowed by your license. Although this problem has been corrected, in general a User Id should NOT be changed if, for example, one sampro user  was being replaced by another.&nbsp; The preferred method of handling the user record if one user will be replacing another is to first disable one user record (for the old user) and then create a new record for the new user.</P>
 <P>This release also changes the way in which ‘Active’ users of specific type are counted. Previously, when counting active users for licensing purposes, the system only looked at users whose ‘Disabled’ field was clear (set to No). In this release, active users are those whose Disabled field is clear AND whose Password Expiration Date is either blank (1900-01-01) or set to a future date. This brings the licensing calcuations in line with the users that are displayed as active in the list. </P>
 <H3>1.11.1&nbsp;New Tab: Additional Groups</H3>
 <P>This tab enables users to belong to other Users Groups in addition to the primary one specified in the upper portion of this viewer.  The Group Id in the parent determines the password settings used during the login process. After the initial login, the available functions are determined by the parent User Group <FONT style="text-decoration:underline;" >plus</FONT> each of the Additional User Groups.</P>
 <P style="margin-left:36.00pt;"><FONT style="text-decoration:underline;" >Example:</FONT><BR>A user that handles both Service Management and Purchasing functions could be assigned to the Service Group in the User Parent record, and the Purchasing Group in the Additional Groups tab. </P>
 <H3>1.11.2 New Tab: Additional Profiles</H3>
 <P>This tab displays the additional Security information previously displayed on the lower portion of the screen.</P>
 <P><FONT style="font-weight:bold; " >Group Id:<BR></FONT>Switching Security Identities builds a new function list that is determined by the User Group from the selected Security Identity plus each of the Additional User Groups.</P>
 <H2>1.12 Viewer Change Log</H2>
 <P>An entry to the Record Change Log table is now recorded when a record is added. </P>
 <H2>1.13 Common Phrase viewer</H2>
 <P>This viewer no longer allows a leading or embedded blank character in the Id.</P>
 <H2>1.14 Viewers with Child Tabs</H2>
 <P>In previous versions, the line buttons toggled between gray and enabled by clicking the Magnify and Line View buttons. If you didn’t toggle back to Line View, the buttons remain grayed out. In this version, if the user switches directly to a different tab the line buttons will be re-enabled. The line buttons are re-enabled when the user saves a record,  selects a different record from the Id field, or uses Next or Previous Record buttons. </P>
 <H2>1.15 Side Button Bar</H2>
 <P><IMG src="images/noteson1.gif" align=left border=0 height=28 width=48 alt="images\noteson1.gif"><FONT style="font-weight:bold; " > </FONT>The Notes button that is displayed when notes exist has been changed to be (hopefully) more obvious to the user.  </P>
 <H2>1.16 Send Support Data Help Menu Option </H2>
 <P>This new option added to the Help menu is labeled 'Send Support Data'.&nbsp; There is no group or user security provided so any user is eligible to execute the new option when instructed to by Data-Basics support. When this new option is selected: </P>
 <P style="margin-left:36.00pt;">A Dictionary of useful information from the user's current session is compiled.&nbsp; </P>
 <P style="margin-left:36.00pt;">The user is prompted for a File Save location once the Support Data Dictionary has been compiled.&nbsp; </P>
 <P style="margin-left:36.00pt;">Due to the potentially large size of the resulting object file, no automated link to the user's email has been provided.&nbsp;The user may choose to upload or email this file to support.  </P>
 <H2>1.17 ReportAnywhere</H2>
 <P>In an earlier build, we implemented the ability of ReportAnywhere to print a hard copy of the report. This functionality has now been expanded to support the printing of the bitmap assorted with the report via registry. </P>
 <P>Report auto-save functionality now  works for reports produced by Report Anywhere.</P>
 <H2>1.18 Scroll Wheel Mouse</H2>
 <P>Scrolling the mouse wheel up or down while a report (such as the Service Invoice)  was being generated could result in  “Key is missing” error and assorted problems with history. This release prevents scrolling errors while waiting for the report to display.</P>
 <P>Scrolling the mouse wheel up or down  while a record was being saved resulted in record values being changed and resulting errors in the saved record. This build corrects this problem by disabling the ability to scroll while saving the record. </P>
 <H2>1.19 Password Change (Lock button)</H2>
 <P>The Report Password fields (in the window that is displayed when the Change Password button on the second row of the top button bar is clicked) were once used for Access reporting. These fields are for the most part obsolete and have been removed from the Change Password window.&nbsp;</P>
 <H2>1.20 Updated Reports</H2>
 <P>Be sure to consult with your support representative concerning the latest versions of SAM Pro reports. </P>
 <P>This release corrects a System Primitive Failure error that occurred with saving some reports as .CSV files. </P>
 <H3>1.21.1 Mailing Labels</H3>
 <P>The following reports have been revised to allow the user to select the format (5161 or 8163) and enter a top margin value for alignment:</P>
 <P>Report Mailing Labels - Client  (ARCLABEL.rpt)</P>
 <P>Report Mailing Labels - Client Site (ARCSLABEL.rpt)</P>
 <P>Report Mailing Label Employee (PRELABEL.rpt)</P>
 <P>Report Mailing Label Vendor (APVLABEL.rpt)</P>
 <P>These reports are now available for download and installed into your customer’s databases.  The Employee version is dated 5/27/2009, and the others are 5/15/2009.</P>
 <P><FONT style="font-weight:bold; " >Important - Registry Setting Required:</FONT> A registry entry for each of the mailing label functions must be created which contains the following Setting Key / Setting Value:</P>

 <H3>1.21.2  Service Invoice Related</H3>
 <P style="margin-left:36.00pt;"><FONT style="font-weight:bold; " >Service Invoice Posting Report (SERVICEINVOICEPOST.rpt) – 1/21/2010</FONT></P>
 <P style="margin-left:36.00pt;">Starting with this release, the default behavior of the system is for COD Service Invoices to be posted to both the AR Sales Journal AND the AR Cash Receipts Journal to be more in line with TechAnywhere functionality. The new version of this report supports this functionality. </P>
 <P style="margin-left:36.00pt;"><FONT style="font-weight:bold; " >Service Worksheet (serviceworksheet.rpt) – 10.22.2009</FONT></P>

 <P style="margin-left:72.00pt;"><FONT style="font-weight:bold; " >03/31/2010</FONT><FONT style="font-weight:bold; " > – Show Invoice Detail by Equipment</FONT></P>
 <P style="margin-left:72.00pt;">An option to show Service Invoice detail info by Equipment is now available. If the Work Order lines are not associated with an Equipment, charges will be grouped under the heading Equipment: none specified. Along with the updated SERVICEINVOICE.prt (dated 3/31/2010 or later) The following registry entry must be created to use this mod:</P>
 <P style="margin-left:72.00pt;">Id: sys-start-ssrvcebllngcmpte&nbsp; </P>
 <P style="margin-left:72.00pt;">Setting Key: ShowDetailByEquipment&nbsp;Setting Value:true</P>
 <P style="margin-left:72.00pt;">Note that this functionality is only exhibited if the Show Equipment Detail option is selected in Service Invoice. It is suggested that the this option be set via the initial values functionality:</P>
 <P style="margin-left:72.00pt;">Id: sys-start-ssrvcebllngcmpte&nbsp; </P>
 <P style="margin-left:72.00pt;">Setting Key: initialValueFor~srvceinvce.eqpmnt-dtl&nbsp;&nbsp;Setting Value:On</P>
 <P style="margin-left:72.00pt;"><FONT style="font-weight:bold; " >07/12/2010</FONT></P>
 <P style="margin-left:72.00pt;">A recent tax change in Canada has resulted in some users having to change the Tax Authority in the WO Sales Tax tab. In the version of the Service Invoice Report dated July 12, 2010, this has been corrected so that the Service Invoice used the tax authority information on the WO tax tab to display the tax information correctly on the invoice. Because of an internal change, this report should only be used with version 7.2.476.091 and higher.  </P>
 <P style="margin-left:72.00pt;"><FONT style="font-weight:bold; " >08/06</FONT><FONT style="font-weight:bold; " >/2010</FONT></P>

 <P style="margin-left:72.00pt;">PM Invoices (using the Service Compute PM Invoice functionality) now reference the PM Invoice Workorder in the Document record. </P>
 <P style="margin-left:72.00pt;">Auto-saved Service Invoices now attach to the Client Site in addition to the Client, Job, Work Order, and Invoice Master records to which they currently attach.</P>

 <P>When auto building a user report query, the quick-pick list now excludes non-database table entries such as 'rvnetype'. When generating an SQL statement for a report, sporadic improper ORDER BY clauses have been corrected. </P>
 <H2>1.23 Journal Viewers </H2>
 <P>Validation has been added to prevent the user from accidentally changing a Journal’s Id when they meant to access another entry. This could occur if the user changed the id, and then clicked Add or Save BEFORE tabbing out of the field. Now, if the user types in a different Id and immediately presses Add or Save, the system will display the message: Add/Change Action cannot be completed: the Transaction Id cannot be edited by the user.</P>
 <H2>1.24 Exiting / Switching Security</H2>
 <P>This release includes<FONT style="font-weight:bold; " > </FONT>changes to prevent sporadic problems with service invoices not being archived. Assorted fixes, including the requirement that all unsaved changes be resolved before the use logs out or switches security. &quot;Exit not allowed while open viewers have unsaved changes&quot; will be displayed if changes to any viewers must be confirmed or abandoned. This functionality does not apply to Report ranges that are open at the time of the exit. </P>
 <P>Additional processing to ensure that that neither a Security or Branch override setting gets 'stuck' in memory when switching security.</P>
 <H2>1.25 Printing List Reports</H2>
 <P>Corrects a problem with printing lists (from SAM Pro viewers) where the header was printed twice on the first page.</P>
 <H2>1.26 Document Archiving</H2>
 <P>The read-only file attribute is now set on archived documents. This does not apply to report-type documents that get auto-created while running SAMPRO. The following  registry option described in user note 2.28 provides SAMPRO users with some control over how the read-only attribute is applied. </P>
 <P>This enhancement allows the user to specify attachments to other tables in the record when attaching or scanning a new document from the viewer (functionality that Quick Attach already provides). See user note 2.36 for the registry option to do so. </P>
 <H2>1.27 Viewers</H2>
 <P>The software now disables keyboard and mouse-driven actions in SAM Pro while record viewers are saving data. The optional registry entry detailed in user note 2.33  may be used to display a message when a record has been successfully added, saved or deleted. </P>
 <P>Enhanced Save methodology implemented for viewers / functions. </P>
 <P>Better handling of viewer lists with massive amounts of data (GL History, for example) that resulted in ‘Low on Memory’ and ‘NonContinuable Protection Violation’ errors in previous versions. </P>
 <P>Corrects errors in 'backColor:' </P>
 <P>Handles sporadic problems when a new viewer was started from a button appearing on a form. </P>
 <H2>1.28 Security / Branch Overrides</H2>
 <P>If foreign currency and job override processing are both in effect, the Service Compute and Reverse Job Invoice GL posts to the Currency Adjustment account now include the correct Security Id. This release also corrects Branch Override processing on these functions. </P>
 <H2>1.29 Accounting Period</H2>
 <P> Previously, users could maintain multiple default periods by security. On further consideration, the validation has been changed so that only one accounting period can be saved as the default. </P>
 <H2>1.30 Emailing</H2>
 <P>When sending a report by email from Sampro, the single quote (apostrophe) in the body of the email or subject line was being doubled. This has been corrected. </P>
 <P>The emailing of pdf’s now works when a path of type //Server/... is used.</P>
 <H2>1.31 Initial Values for Starters – General Enhancement</H2>
 <P>A new registry setting option has been added for help in setting the initial default values for starter functions that have input screens.&nbsp;See user note 2.30 for details.&nbsp; </P>
 <H2>1.32 Printer List</H2>
 <P>Users with a very large number of printers may have found some missing from SAM Pro’s list of printers because the allowable number of characters for all the printers names was exceeded. The allowable number of characters has been expanded from 6000 to 10,000 characters to correct this problem.</P>
 <H2>1.33 Drilldown Reports</H2>
 <P>This release corrects a problem with drilldown reports which used hidden fields to pass values to component reports; the hidden field information (such as the Client Id) was not being passed correctly when doubling-clicking in the report to drill down. </P>

 <H3>User Group Specific Enhancement</H3>
 <P>In previous releases, the standard SAMPRO registry entry technology follows this progression in looking for registry entries: </P>
 <P>1. By Branch Id, User Id<BR>2. By Branch Id<BR>3. By Security Id</P>
 <P>A fourth option has been added:</P>
 <P>4. By User Group Id</P>
 <P><FONT style="font-weight:bold; " >This option pertains to the User Group Id in the User’s parent record (in the upper portion of the User record). </FONT>You might want to implement this functionality to restrict the access of certain user groups to specific fields in a viewer, or to not display specific viewer tabs. </P>

 <H2>2.4 Global Settings (sys-ffv-global-settings)</H2>
 <H3>Printing Saved DBRs – Registry to Default User’s Printer</H3>
 <P>When a report is printed and archived and printed in SAM Pro, the information concerning the original printed is retained. If the user accesses the .dbr file to reprint it, the original printer will be selected, not the user’s default printer. This following global registry entry may be implemented to disable this functionality, and instead always select the user’s current default printer when reprinting saved reports.</P>
 <P>Registry setting:</P>
 <P><FONT style="font-weight:bold; " >Setting Key:</FONT> ReprintToUsersDefaultPrinter&nbsp;<FONT style="font-weight:bold; " >Setting Value:</FONT> true&nbsp;  &nbsp;<FONT style="font-weight:bold; " >Comments:</FONT> Default is false&nbsp;</P>
 <H3>Auto-scrolling in SAM Pro Reports</H3>
 <P>This functionality applies when displaying SAMPRO reports. Vertical scrolling is now capable of automatically advancing to the 'next page' once the user has scrolled to the bottom of the current page.&nbsp; Similar functionality exists for upward scrolling and automatically moving to the 'previous page'.</P>
 <P>Make the following global registry setting to implement the new feature: </P>
 <P><FONT style="font-weight:bold; " >Setting Key:</FONT> ReportAutoScroll&nbsp;<FONT style="font-weight:bold; " >Setting Value:</FONT> true&nbsp;    <FONT style="font-weight:bold; " >Comments:</FONT> Default is false&nbsp;</P>
 <P>A second (optional) setting is available for controlling the point at which the auto-scroll takes place: </P>
 <P><FONT style="font-weight:bold; " >Setting Key:</FONT> ReportAutoScrollRatio&nbsp;<FONT style="font-weight:bold; " >Setting Value:</FONT> <FONT style="font-style:italic; " >nn</FONT>&nbsp;<FONT style="font-weight:bold; " >Comments:</FONT> Default is 90</P>
 <P>The Ratio setting defines the point at which the 'bottom' of the current page has been reached and the auto-scroll should trigger.&nbsp; For example, assume the ratio has been set to 90.&nbsp; That tells SAMPRO that the bottom of any page has been reached when the last line of the report page appears at a point 90% down from the top.&nbsp; Or, in other words, the page has 10% white space at the bottom of the display window.</P>
 <H3>2.4.1 Inventory Revenue Based on Last Cost </H3>
 <P><FONT style="font-weight:bold; " >Setting Key: </FONT>InventoryRevenueFromLast<FONT style="font-weight:bold; " >&nbsp;Setting Value: </FONT>true</P>
 <P>This setting forces revenue calculations for inventory parts <FONT style="text-decoration:underline;" >not</FONT> flagged as Use Unit Price to perform the markup based on Last Overall Cost (for any location) regardless of costing method chosen in part record. Inventory that is flagged as Use Unit Price will continue to have the revenue calculated at the unit price.</P>
 <H3>2.4.2 Defer Tax Status Decision </H3>
 <P>This registry entry, when implemented, would result in the Sale tax type (for Job Tax Statuses of Unknown, Sales and Exempt) always default to space n/a so that the tax would be calculated at invoicing. This registry option does NOT pertain to Jobs with a Sale Tax Type of Use; Use type jobs will be handled as usual.</P>
 <P>To implement globally:</P>
 <P><FONT style="font-weight:bold; " >Setting Key: </FONT>DeferTaxStatusDecision<FONT style="font-weight:bold; " >&nbsp;Setting Value:</FONT> true</P>
 <P>Alternately, this registry option may be implement on a viewer by viewer basis (e.g., in the sys-viewer-vwrkordr to implement in work orders). </P>
 <P>Note: to prevent users from altering the Tax Type in, for example, the Work Order viewer, make the appropriate registry entries to disable the Tax Type fields.</P>
 <H3>2.4.3 Global Default GL Account</H3>
 <P>When this setting is in place, any attempt to write a new record to the GL History where a GL Account is not specified will use the GL Account specified by this entry instead.  A valid GL Account Id must be specified in this entry. </P>
 <P><FONT style="font-weight:bold; " >Additional Contents:</FONT> DefaultGLAccountId=<FONT style="font-style:italic; " >GL Account Id</FONT></P>
 <P>For example, this could happen if the user printed and posted a construction-type invoice with Retainage $$$ but NO Retainage GL Account. Without this entry, the post would be to the blank GL Account. With this entry, the Retainage dollars would be written to the account defined in this entry, making it easier to find and correct errors. Note that the Job Invoice Posting report does not yet display the Default Global Account. </P>
 <H3>2.4.4 WebHelp (for Windows 7/Vista)</H3>
 <P>Data-Basics now offers support for context specific Web Help. This type of Help should be enabled if your operating system does not support WinHelp, and cannot be ‘patched’ to do so. </P>
 <P>To Activate WebHelp add this registry option to your sys-ffv-global-settings registry:</P>
 <P><FONT style="font-weight:bold; " >Setting Key:</FONT> HelpFileType &nbsp;<FONT style="font-weight:bold; " >Setting Value:</FONT> WebHelp</P>
 <P><FONT style="font-weight:bold; " >Installation:</FONT> Your system must have a folder entitled WebHelp located in the directory where the executable is located; this file is currently available from Jean on request. </P>
 <P><FONT style="font-weight:bold; " >Update</FONT><FONT style="font-weight:bold; " >s</FONT><FONT style="font-weight:bold; " >:</FONT> If WebHelp is updated, the first user into the system after the update will be asked to confirm the update: they should always answer ‘Yes’ to this confirmation. </P>
 <P><FONT style="font-weight:bold; " >User Requirements: </FONT></P>
 <P style="margin-left:36.00pt;">To see the WebHelp correctly, the &quot;Allow active contest to run in files on My Computer&quot; needs to be checked (Control Panel =&gt; Internet Options =&gt; Advanced =&gt; Security in XP) . Otherwise, you will have click on the browser to allow active content every time you access Help.</P>
 <P><FONT style="font-weight:bold; " >User Notes: </FONT></P>
 <P style="margin-left:36.00pt;">VISTA: if you are running Vista, WebHelp launches IE no matter what browser is the default. </P>
 <P style="margin-left:36.00pt;">XP: If you are running XP, and Firefox is your default browser, SAM Pro will launch WebHelp in Firefox.&nbsp; If Internet Explorer is your defaut browser, SAM Pro will launch WebHelp in Internet Explorer. If some other browser is your default, SAM Pro will launch WebHelp in Internet Explorer.</P>
 <H3>2.4.5 TechAnywhere - Defaulting OH Job Cost Category</H3>
 <P>Currently, the job cost category defaults from the labor rate id selected in TechAnywhere. If a tech selects a direct labor rate id on a overhead work order the time post will fail. This registry entry overrides the cost category default that normally would happen ONLY when time is posting from TechAnywhere to a OH job.</P>
 <P><FONT style="font-weight:bold; " >Setting Key:</FONT> DefaultOverheadCostCategoryForTechAnywhere&nbsp;</P>
 <P><FONT style="font-weight:bold; " >Setting Value:</FONT> <FONT style="font-style:italic; " >OHCostCategoryId</FONT></P>
 <H3>2.4.6 Tech Finder – display WO/Zone Count instead of Hours</H3>
 <P>In this release, the original Tech Finder Hours will be displayed as the default behavior. If the user wishes to display the new WO/ Zone counts (see user note 10.8), the following option must be added to the sys-ffv-global-settings registry entry: </P>
 <P><FONT style="font-weight:bold; " >Setting Key:</FONT> TechFinderWOZone&nbsp;<FONT style="font-weight:bold; " >Setting Value:</FONT> true </P>
 <P>The Default is now to show the original hours.</P>
 <P style="margin-left:36.00pt;">Tip: Don’t forget to set in sys-techfinder the grid-width-char:</P>
 <P style="margin-left:36.00pt;">4 for hours&nbsp; (the default is 8)<BR>10 for WO Zone (the default is 10)</P>
 <H3>2.4.7 Cache All Registry Options</H3>
 <P>This build enables the caching of all registry options for performance purposes. When enabled, the user must log off and on again to see all registry changes, not just those for sys-ffv-global-settings and other global entries. The default behavior has NOT been changed.&nbsp; The registry entry that enables the caching is as follows: </P>
 <P><FONT style="font-weight:bold; " >Setting Key:</FONT> cacheregistry&nbsp;<FONT style="font-weight:bold; " >Setting Value:</FONT> true</P>
 <P>Note that when this registry entry is enabled, the system will display the warning that the warning that the registry entry is cached for all registry entries, and that  the user must log off to see the change.  </P>
 <H3>2.4.8 Journals – Do not Default in Equipment Id if Work Order Id is selected – (restore default behavior)</H3>
 <P>The Equipment Id field now appears after the Work Order Id in the AP, Job, Labor and Purchase Order detail tabs. When the user enters a Work Order Id in any of these tabs, the new default behavior is for the Equipment on the first line of the Work Order’s Equipment tab to default in The following registry option may be used to disable this behavior so that the Equipment Id does NOT default in.</P>
 <P><FONT style="font-weight:bold; " >Id:</FONT> sys-ffv-global-settings</P>
 <P><FONT style="font-weight:bold; " >Setting Key:</FONT> DefaultEquipmentFromWorkOrder</P>
 <P><FONT style="font-weight:bold; " >Setting Value:</FONT> false</P>
 <P>The default is True.&nbsp; When not True, don't default in the Equipment Id.&nbsp; </P>
 <P style="margin-left:36.00pt;"><FONT style="font-weight:bold; " >Note:</FONT> If the sys-ffv-global setting 'DefaultEquipmentFromWorkorder' is set to false,  the user is now allowed to set the Equipment Id back to blank in the Labor, PO and AP Journals. If this registry option is not present or set to true, the Equipment Id must be completed if a Work Order Id is referenced. </P>
 <H3>2.4.9  Price Code Handling – always default Price Code Level 1 Price</H3>
 <P>This registry entry impacts the Work Order, Quote, Client Order, and CSRAnywhere (Quote Management). Note that the Inventory Item allows for 10 levels of Material Pricing, but Price Codes only allow for 5. </P>
 <P>Registry Option to always default Price Code 1:</P>
 <P>Id: sys-ffv-global-settings </P>
 <P>Setting Key: DefaultExceptionPriceCodeLevel1 &nbsp;Setting Value: true</P>
 <P>When this option is enabled, and the system defaults inventory unit pricing and there is a Price Code in play, the system ignores the Price Level found in the Client Site or Job and assumes price level 1 of the Price Code. This setting impacts the Work Order, Quote, Client Order, and CSRAnywhere (Quote Management).  </P>
 <P>The default (if this option is NOT implemented) and Price Codes are in effect, and the default price level from the Client Site or Job is greater then 5, the system now defaults price level 1 from the Price Code. If the default Price Level (in the Site or Job) is 5 or less, the corresponding Price Code Price will be used. </P>
 <H3>2.4.10 Deny Change / Delete to Notes Unless User is a Notes Administrator</H3>
 <P>This enhancement Implements a global registry setting that prevents non-administrator users from changing or deleting Notes records.&nbsp; When this setting is ON, only a Notes Administrator account can change and delete publice or private notes.</P>
 <P>Id: sys-ffv-global-settings</P>
 <P>Setting Key: NoteChangeDeleteRequiresAdministrator  Setting Value: true </P>
 <P>Rules for Note Record change and delete actions are as follows ...</P>
 <P>A Notes Administrator can change/delete all but 'secure' notes. Only a support representative can delete or change secure notes. </P>
 <P>If the original author is not a Notes administrator, they can change/delete their own private and all public notes <FONT style="text-decoration:underline;" >except</FONT> when the new registry setting is in place.</P>
 <P style="margin-top:0;margin-bottom:0">&nbsp;</P>
 <H2>2.5 Master Contracts – Registry Entry to Remove Restrictions</H2>
 <P>By default, the system imposes the following restrictions on Master Contracts:</P>
 <P style="margin-left:36.00pt;">Users may not use the Renew button to adjust existing lines for the current date range. </P>
 <P style="margin-left:36.00pt;">Users are not allowed to manually adjust billing or inspection lines that have already been generated for the current date range. </P>
 <P style="margin-left:36.00pt;">Master Contracts must be specified for one calendar year.</P>
 <P>These restrictions are imposed to prevent the users from generating extra copies of billings/pm work orders that have already been created.  However, if the user wishes to adjust a contract, the default behavior may be too restrictive. This registry options allows you to remove the above restrictions in the viewer.  WARNING: this registry option should be used with caution.  If additional billings / pm’s are generated due to changes made to an existing schedule, it is the USER’S responsibility to reverse previously generated invoices and cancel previously pm work orders. </P>
 <P>Id: sys-viewer-vmstrcntrct</P>
 <P><FONT style="font-weight:bold; " >Setting Key:</FONT> Remove Validations &nbsp;<FONT style="font-weight:bold; " >Setting Value:</FONT><FONT style="font-weight:bold; " > </FONT>true </P>
 <P>If this registry entry is in place, and the user presses the Renew button for the current date, the following message will be displayed: “Warning – This action will replace the existing schedule. Any previously generated invoices and work orders will still exist. Are you sure you want to continue?</P>
 <P>If the user clicks Yes, the Schedule will be replaced.  If Create PM Billing  / Work Orders is rerun, it is possible that duplicate work orders / invoices may be created. </P>
 <H2>2.6 Registry Job Billing Item (sys-viewer-vjbbllngitm)</H2>
 <H3>Purpose: </H3>

 <P><FONT style="font-weight:bold; " >Setting Key: </FONT>AllowChangeOrderEntry<FONT style="font-weight:bold; " >   Setting Value: </FONT>false&nbsp; </P>
 <P>This registry option restricts the behavior of the Job Billing Item viewer so that it can't be used to enter or edit Change Orders.&nbsp; When this setting is in use, the system denies entry/changes into the fields labeled Change Order?, Contract Changes, C.O. Date Requested and C.O. Date Approved.  The default is true. <BR></P>

 <H2>2.8  Reporting – general registry entry (sys-report-functionid)</H2>
 <H3>Display Report Criteria</H3>
 <P>This enhancement enables the optional printing of your report settings and ranges appear together as a page on the 'printed' report. Some reports aren't eligible for printing the report criteria.&nbsp; These exceptions tend to be reports that use pre-printed forms and/or have report-printed-ok confirmation prompts.&nbsp; Examples are Checks, Invoices, PO forms, etc.</P>
 <P><FONT style="font-weight:bold; " >Id:</FONT> sys-report-<FONT style="font-style:italic; " >functionid</FONT></P>
 <P><FONT style="font-weight:bold; " >SettingKey:</FONT> PrintReportCriteria&nbsp;<FONT style="font-weight:bold; " >SettingValue:</FONT> reportfirstpage  Or  reportlastpage OR sectionfirstpage OR false</P>
 <H3>Display Report as PDF</H3>
 <P>When this option is enabled, reports will be previewed as PDF’s instead of in SAM Pro’s Report viewer. This new option may be implemented GLOBALLY for all reports that do NOT require posting (e.g., invoices, po’s, etc.) by creating the following registry setting:</P>
 <P><FONT style="font-weight:bold; " >Id:</FONT> sys-ffv-global-settings<BR><FONT style="font-weight:bold; " >SettingKey:</FONT> PreviewReportsAsPDF&nbsp;<FONT style="font-weight:bold; " >SettingValue:</FONT> true</P>
 <P>To implement for individual reports, the following registry entries are needed:</P>
 <P><FONT style="font-weight:bold; " >Id:</FONT> sys-report-<FONT style="font-style:italic; " >functionid</FONT></P>
 <P><FONT style="font-weight:bold; " >SettingKey:</FONT> PreviewReportsAsPDF&nbsp;<FONT style="font-weight:bold; " >SettingValue:</FONT> true</P>
 <P>Note that if the user attempts to preview a report with no contents (e.g, the ranges have been set so that zero pages will be generated), the system will display the message “Report has zero pages to display no PDF File will be created.”</P>
 <P>Regardless of any new registry settings, SAMPRO rejects PDF previewing for certain reports that require posting code.&nbsp; Generally, that list includes all reports that have a 'Print Ok?' prompt.&nbsp; This includes printing AP Checks, PR Checks, PO Forms, etc.</P>
 <H3>Specify Initial Default Report Settings</H3>
 <P>The software now supports general functionality for registry entries for reports which will allow for the default setting for Settings and Range type fields to be specified.</P>
 <P><FONT style="font-weight:bold; " >Setting Key:</FONT> InitialValueFor~<FONT style="font-style:italic; " >fieldId</FONT><FONT style="font-style:italic; " >&nbsp;</FONT><FONT style="font-weight:bold; " >Setting Value:</FONT> <FONT style="font-style:italic; " >fieldvalue</FONT></P>
 <P>Note that ”fieldId” is display on the report screen when you lay your cursor over it. For boolean fields (check boxes), the field value of true is for checked, and false is for blank. </P>
 <P style="margin-left:36.00pt;">Example: enable the Estimated Sales Tax box on the updated Quote Form report</P>
 <P style="margin-left:36.00pt;">Id: sys-report-rqtefrm</P>
 <P style="margin-left:36.00pt;">Setting Key: initialValueFor~p_shw_estmtd_tx &nbsp;Setting Value: true</P>
 <H3>Auto-emailing:  Do Not Email User Running Report if Report Section lacks a Recipient Email Address</H3>
 <P>By default, if the User's email is completed in the User's Contact Record AND the appropriate Email To address is blank (for example, the Email Invoice Address (or Billing Address Id) in the Job is blank for service invoices), the invoice is sent to the User's Email Address in the Contact record. This may be undesirable. The following registry setting applies to auto-emailing in general and may be implemented on a report by report basis to disable the emailing of a report section when the section does NOT have a recipient email address available.</P>
 <P><FONT style="font-weight:bold; " >Setting Key: </FONT>SkipEmailNoAddress&nbsp;<FONT style="font-weight:bold; " >Setting Value:</FONT> Y  (default is N)</P>
 <H3>Option to prevent Zero Dollar Service Invoice</H3>
 <P>This option applies specifically to Service Invoicing and can be used to prevent the emailing of zero-dollar invoices.</P>
 <P>Id: sys-report-serviceinvoice&nbsp;</P>
 <P><FONT style="font-weight:bold; " >Setting Key:</FONT> SkipEmailZeroInvoice&nbsp;<FONT style="font-weight:bold; " >Setting Value:</FONT> Y (default is N)</P>
 <P style="margin-top:0;margin-bottom:0">&nbsp;</P>
 <H2>2.9 Registry Option to specify location of EFT file (sys-eft)</H2>
 <P>By default, the electronic file generated by Report EFT is automatically written to the directory containing the Sam pro executable.&nbsp; This new registry option enables the user to specify a directory path to override the default:</P>
 <P><FONT style="font-weight:bold; " >Id:</FONT> sys-eft-glbankaccountid-glentity or sys-eft-glbankaccountid-</P>
 <P><FONT style="font-weight:bold; " >SettingKey:</FONT> PathName&nbsp;<FONT style="font-weight:bold; " >SettingValue:</FONT> <FONT style="font-style:italic; " >s</FONT><FONT style="font-style:italic; " >harepath/eftdirectory</FONT></P>
 <P>Note that <FONT style="font-style:italic; " >sharepath/eftdirectory</FONT> must be replaced by a valid directory name.</P>
 <H2>2.10 Client Registry (sys-viewer-vclnt)</H2>
 <H3>Entry to Show Converted Data on Collections Screen</H3>
 <P>The code to include the converted invoices requires the following registry option:</P>
 <P><FONT style="font-weight:bold; " >Id:</FONT> sys-viewer-vclnt</P>
 <P><FONT style="font-weight:bold; " >Setting Key:</FONT> ConversionSource&nbsp;<FONT style="font-weight:bold; " >Setting Value:</FONT> 'the conversion identifier used in arhstry_srce_jrnl'</P>
 <P>&nbsp;<FONT style="font-weight:bold; text-decoration:underline;" >Example:</FONT><FONT style="font-weight:bold; " >   </FONT>Setting Key: ConversionSource  Setting Value: conversion</P>
 <P><FONT style="font-weight:bold; " >&nbsp;Note:</FONT> contact your support representative for the correct setting value for your system. </P>
 <H2>2.11 Inventory Item Registry (sys-viewer-vinvntryitm)</H2>
 <H3>Registry to warn, error if a Standard Cost Item has no Standard Cost</H3>
 <P><FONT style="font-weight:bold; " >Id:</FONT> sys-viewer-vinvntryitm<BR><FONT style="font-weight:bold; " >Setting Key:</FONT> StandardUnitCostValidation&nbsp;<FONT style="font-weight:bold; " >Setting Value:</FONT> <FONT style="font-style:italic; " >warning</FONT><FONT style="font-style:italic; " >   or error</FONT>  </P>
 <P>One of the cost types in the Inventory Item record is Standard, but selecting this type did not require the user to complete the Standard Cost field.  This registry entry enables the user to specify that the system display an error or warning message when the user attempts to save or a record where Standard is the cost type but the Standard Cost field is not completed. Note that in the case of the warning, the user will be able to save the record. If the error option is selected, the Standard Cost field must be completed before the record can be saved. </P>
 <P>The default is to retain the current behavior which means no warning or error.</P>
 <H2>2.12  Work Order Viewer / Start Work Order Entry (sys-viewer-vwrkordr)</H2>
 <H3>2.12.1 Entry to use the default service job in the Equipment record for all but Preventive Maintenance WO’s</H3>
 <P>By default, the system uses the Job in the Work Order header as the default job for entering labor, inventory and other lines. Depending upon how your firm’s data is structured, however, it may be more appropriate to default in the Default Service Job from the Equipment record. </P>
 <P>If this registry entry is enabled (and this is NOT a preventative maintenance work order), when a user enters an equipment id on the Labor, Inventory, or Other tabs, the system now checks to see if there is a default service job in the equipment header and if so, defaults the Job, Cost Code and Billing item to the row. If the job info is blank in the equipment record, the system uses the job info in the work order header (like it does now).</P>
 <P>To enable this feature (in the Work Order viewer, Start Work Order Entry AND the TechAnywhere Post) add the following registry entry:</P>
 <P style="margin-left:36.00pt;">Id: sys-viewer-vwrkordr</P>
 <P style="margin-left:36.00pt;"><FONT style="font-weight:bold; " >Setting Key:</FONT>  DefaultJobByEquipmentId&nbsp;&nbsp;<FONT style="font-weight:bold; " >Setting Value:</FONT> true</P>
 <P>Note: in the Work Order Viewer, the Equipment Id has been repositioned to facilitate its selection. </P>
 <H3>2.12.2 Set Effective Date from Date Work Completed</H3>
 <P>When the user 'starts' a new line on the Work Order Labor, Inventory or Other, this registry option will default the line's date from the parent Date Work Completed.&nbsp; The following registry setting is needed to implement this feature:</P>
 <P><FONT style="font-weight:bold; " >Setting Key:</FONT> DefaultLineDateFromDateWorkCompleted &nbsp;<FONT style="font-weight:bold; " >Setting Value:</FONT> true</P>
 <P><FONT style="font-weight:bold; " >Notes on Usage:</FONT></P>
 <P>If you are just entering lines directly, if you set the Date Completed and then tab out of the field,  the system will use the Date Work Competed as the Effective date defaults. Any validation problems on effective date / payroll period / accounting period are caught on SAVING the work order.</P>
 <P>When importing costs, the Date Worked Completed must be entered AFTER the cost import and before entering your lines directly. If the date is set before, then the user must save the work order before importing costs.</P>
 <H3>2.12.3 Launch Start Service Billing Compute with Job Id Blank</H3>
 <P>If more than one job is referenced on a work order, and the user forgets to clear the Job Id field in the range after clicking Print Invoice, the system will only generate the invoice for the header job. The following registry option may be implemented so that the system will not set the Job Id when Service Billing Compute is launched from the Work Order.</P>
 <P><FONT style="font-weight:bold; " >Setting Key:</FONT> ClearJobId&nbsp;<FONT style="font-weight:bold; " >Setting Value:</FONT> true</P>
 <P>The default is to complete the Job Id range from the Work Order header when Service Billing Compute is launched from the Work Order. </P>
 <H3>2.12.4 Audit WO Revenue against Job History </H3>
 <P>In this version, the system assume that the work order labor, inventory and other revenue should be validated except when disabled by registry setting. This registry entry is NOT recommended.</P>
 <P><FONT style="font-weight:bold; " >Setting Key:</FONT> AuditInventoryRevenue&nbsp;<FONT style="font-weight:bold; " >Setting Value:</FONT> false</P>
 <P><FONT style="font-weight:bold; " >Setting Key:</FONT> AuditLaborRevenue&nbsp;<FONT style="font-weight:bold; " >Setting Value:</FONT> false</P>
 <P><FONT style="font-weight:bold; " >Setting Key:</FONT> AuditOtherRevenue&nbsp;<FONT style="font-weight:bold; " >Setting Value:</FONT> false</P>
 <P>Note: the default value is to audit WO revenue. The above registry option is needed to turn it OFF. </P>
 <H3>2.12.5 Disable Remote Tech Warning</H3>
 <P>By default, the software displays a warning message if the work order has at least one open assignment to a Remote Tech.&nbsp; The following registry setting disables the warning.</P>
 <P><FONT style="font-weight:bold; " >Setting Key:</FONT> DisableRemoteTechWarning&nbsp;<FONT style="font-weight:bold; " >Setting Value:</FONT> true</P>
 <H3>2.12.6 Credit PO Handling</H3>
 <P>One of the major differences between regular and credit POs is the posting of the Quantity Ordered and Quantity Received values.&nbsp; On a credit PO, the Quantity Received is ignored and the Quantity Ordered is used in its place.&nbsp; For example, on a regular PO the Quantity Received is posted to IMH as Quantity On-hand and to JCH as Actual Quantity.&nbsp; For credit POs, the on-hand and actual quantities are derived from the Quantity Ordered.</P>
 <P>Some customers may wish to use Quantity Received as an indicator that the vendor has actually credited them for the returned items rather than whether the Credit PO is vouchered.&nbsp; By their definition, an open credit PO is one where the Quantity Received is less than the Quantity Ordered on one or more lines.&nbsp; The following registry entry changes the definition for open Credit PO’s to be those where the Quantity Received is less then Quantity Ordered: </P>
 <P><FONT style="font-weight:bold; " >Setting Key:</FONT> CreditPOsMustBeReceived&nbsp;<FONT style="font-weight:bold; " >Setting Value:</FONT> true</P>
 <P>The default value is false so as to preserve existing behavior.&nbsp;</P>
 <H3>2.12.7 Default Quantity and Date if Inventory Item Entered first</H3>
 <P>When this option is implemented, and a new WO-INV line is started and the Inventory Item Id is entered before the Date and Quantity fields, default the Actual Quantity to 1; default the Bill Quantity to 1; and default the Date to the current system date. </P>
 <P><FONT style="font-weight:bold; " >Setting Key:</FONT> EnableCase3571 &nbsp;<FONT style="font-weight:bold; " >Setting Value:</FONT> true</P>
 <P>This option should NOT be used with the DefaultLineDateFromDateWorkCompleted=true option. If both options are set, the WO Date Work Completed is set, when you enter the Inventory Id first, the Effective Date is set to the Date Work Completed, but the quantity is not defaulted to 1.</P>
 <H3>2.12.8 Disable Posting of Budget Cost and Revenue of PM Work Orders</H3>
 <P>This registry option, when implemented, will disable the posting of job history of budget cost and budget revenue for Preventive Maintenance work orders where the work order lines are marked QU and the work order is set to Ready to Invoice. This option would be enabled if a customer wishes to enter manual budgets for PM work. Note that this option only impacts the processing of Work Order Type PreventiveMaint</P>
 <P><FONT style="font-weight:bold; " >Setting Key:</FONT> PostQuotesToJCHBudgets  <FONT style="font-weight:bold; " >Setting Value:</FONT> false</P>
 <H2>2.13 Job Registry (sys-viewer-vjb)</H2>
 <H3>2.13.1 Only Allow Cloning from Templates</H3>
 <P>When this registry option is set, cloning (from the Job record’s Clone Job button)  will only be allowed from template jobs.</P>
 <P><FONT style="font-weight:bold; " >Setting Key:</FONT> CloneFromTemplatesOnly&nbsp;<FONT style="font-weight:bold; " >Setting Value:</FONT> true</P>
 <H3>2.13.2 Allow Change to Job with Retainage</H3>
 <P>In this release, if Retainage has been billed the Client Id cannot be changed.&nbsp; This validation can be changed from an error to a warning with the following registry setting:</P>
 <P><FONT style="font-weight:bold; " >Setting Key</FONT><FONT style="font-weight:bold; " >: </FONT>AllowChangeToJobClient<FONT style="font-weight:bold; " >&nbsp;Setting Value: </FONT>true</P>
 <H3>2.13.3 Clone Job’s Equipment if an Existing Site is Selected</H3>
 <P>Default behavior is to only clone equipment if a Site is NOT selected in the Clone Wizard form. This registry option changes the behavior to clone a job’s equipment with the Clone Job button if an existing Site is selected. Note that, if this registry setting is in effect, equipment Id’s will only be created if they do not already belong to the existing site. </P>
 <P><FONT style="font-weight:bold; " >Setting Key:</FONT> CloneJobEquipmentExistingSite   <FONT style="font-weight:bold; " >Setting Value:</FONT> true</P>
 <P>Default is false.</P>
 <P style="margin-left:36.00pt;"><FONT style="text-decoration:underline;" >Examples:</FONT></P>
 <P style="margin-left:36.00pt;">If the Site has Equipment Id GIZMO, and so does the Job you are cloning from, the existing site’s equipment record GIZMO will be retained.</P>
 <P style="margin-left:36.00pt;">If the Site has only an Equipment Id WIDGET, and the Job you are cloning from has equipment Id GIZMO, when the job is cloned the existing site will now have two equipment records: GIZMO and WIDGET.</P>
 <H2>2.14 AP Checks </H2>
 <H3>Pay to the Order Of option for custom checks</H3>
 <P style="margin-left:36.00pt;">New behavior is triggered by the following registry setting ...<BR>Id: sys-report-rapchck<BR>Setting Key: PrintPayToTheOrderOf&nbsp;Setting Value: true</P>
 <P style="margin-left:36.00pt;">PAY TO THE ORDER OF value is extracted from the first line of the check's mailing address.&nbsp; The value is printed two lines above the spelled-out check amount.&nbsp; It is indented from the left margin approximately the same as the mailing address so as to accommodate pre-printed check forms.</P>
 <P style="margin-left:36.00pt;">This new option is available to anyone using either the standard AP Check form or the standard MICR form.&nbsp; Users with custom AP Check formats will be required to request a separate modification for their forms.</P>
 <H2>2.15 Registry Service Channel (sys-FMMS)</H2>
 <P>The Sampro Registry entry ‘sys-FMMS’ must be present in order to enable the FMMS system. It can be temporarily disabled by adding an ‘Enabled = No’ line. Changing the line to ‘Enabled = Yes’ will re-enable the FMMS system.</P>
 <P>Configuration settings for the ServiceChannel FMMS system are stored in the ‘sys-FMMS-vendor-ServiceChannel’ entry of the Sampro Registry. Settings include:</P>

 <P>This Registry entry is required in order to run 401(k) reports except for the Cigna report (which has its own registry entry).  If the report is to be run by operating company (for example, if each operating company uses a different plan id,  or has a different matching percent),  you must make a different registry for each operating company you intend to run the report for. </P>

 <H3>2.18.3 Show Invoice Detail by Equipment</H3>
 <P>An option to show Service Invoice detail info by Equipment is now available. If the Work Order lines are not associated with an Equipment, charges will be grouped under the heading Equipment: none specified. Along with the updated SERVICEINVOICE.prt (dated 3/31/2010 or later) The following registry entry must be created to use this mod:</P>

 <H2>2.19 Inventory Adjustment Journal: </H2>
 <H3>Option to warn or error if no default billing item </H3>
 <P>This registry option will generate an error or warning if the user selects a Job Cost Code without a default Billing Item. This corrects a problem that occurred when the used picked a cost code without a default billing item resulting in the entry not having a billing item in history,  and therefore was not imported into Record Billing Adjustments</P>
 <P>The following registry option is needed to report either an error or a warning:<BR><FONT style="font-weight:bold; " >Id:</FONT> sys-viewer-vinvntryadjstmnt<BR><FONT style="font-weight:bold; " >Setting Key:</FONT> NoDefaultBillItem  Setting Value:  error  OR  warning</P>
 <P>Note that the default billing item is now displayed in the Magnify view of the Inventory Adjustment Journal child tab.</P>
 <H3>Technician Material Pickup Wizard</H3>
 <P>The Material Pickup function creates an Inventory Adjustment Journal entry, but does not provide access to the Effective Date and Accounting Period fields so the defaulted values are always used.&nbsp; This means that sometimes (for example, at the beginning of the month) the default Effective Date (today) and the Accounting Period flagged as Default may be out of sync. A registry entry is now available to adjust either of the values to keep them in sync.&nbsp; </P>
 <P><FONT style="font-weight:bold; " >Id:</FONT> sys-viewer-vinvntryadjstmnt</P>
 <P>When the defaulted Date and Accounting Period are NOT out-of-sync, NO adjustments are made to the defaulted values.&nbsp; The rules noted below are used only when an adjustment is necessary.</P>
 <P><FONT style="font-weight:bold; " >Setting Key:</FONT> AdjustDefaultDateOrPeriod &nbsp;<FONT style="font-weight:bold; " >Setting Value:</FONT> period </P>
 <P>The Accounting Period table is queried for eligible Accounting Periods.&nbsp; To qualify, the period must be Active and its date range must include the defaulted Effective Date.&nbsp; When multiple periods are eligible, the one with the smallest Period Id is chosen to become the new Accounting Period for the current transaction.&nbsp; If no eligible period is found, nothing is changed.</P>
 <P><FONT style="font-weight:bold; " >Setting Value:</FONT> date</P>
 <P>The Effective Date is adjusted to be either the Start Date or the End Date of the defaulted Accounting Period.&nbsp; The Start Date is chosen when the current date is less than the Start Date.&nbsp; The End Date is chosen when the current date is greater than the End Date.</P>
 <P>NOTE: the current SAMPRO behavior does not change unless the new registry setting is turned on.&nbsp; The Material Pickup function is the one exception to this.&nbsp; It in the absence of the new setting, it uses the 'adjust period' behavior described above.</P>
 <H2>2.20 GL Account (sys-viewer-vglaccnt)</H2>

 <P>In previous releases, when the QM Wizard was run, information from the quote's Scope of services writes to the WO Equipment Work Performed. All Scopes are concatenated, and also written to the WO Work Performed. However, nothing is written to the WO Equipment Work Requested, and this is the information that is shown in New Call.</P>
 <P>This enhancement is for the Wizard to also update the WO Equipment Work Requested from the applicable Quote Scope line if the following registry option is implemented, and the Quote’s subcontractor work requested field is blank.  If the WO Equipment Work Requested field already contains text, the information from the Scope Tab (scope of services) is added to the existing information. </P>
 <P><FONT style="font-weight:bold; " >Setting Key:</FONT> SetWOWRFromScope  <FONT style="font-weight:bold; " >Setting Value:</FONT> true</P>

 <H3>Turn on Quotemaster Wizard Logging:</H3>
 <P>When implemented, the following option will generate a log of the values selected  (system defaults or user-selected) when the Quotemaster Wizard is run (regardless of whether or not the posts are successful).  This option is designed to assist support in resolving questions involving user entries in the wizard. </P>
 <P>The log will be written to the folder defined by the dbreportfiles registry option. The file name of the log file will be of the form: WizardLogForQuote_QuoteId_Date_Time.txt. </P>

 <P>The Import PM Schedule button was enabled to import the PM Schedule from another piece of equipment belonging to the same Site. This functionality did NOT work correctly if the Job Billing Items on the schedule being copied were not flagged as Fixed Fee. The following registry option disables the warning that non-fixed fee billing items are on the client site equipment PM schedule tab which in turn allows a PM Schedule to be imported with non-fixed fee billing items:</P>

 <P>In version 7.2.476.071, we corrected a bug so that, if the Work Code Id is different on two lines of the Client Site Equipment PM Schedule for the same day and technician, the system  forces a separate work order to be created.

 <H2>2.39  Purchase Order (sys-viewer-vprchseordrlst)</H2>
 <H3>Allow PO Type Change on Existing Record</H3>
 <P>In previous releases, users had the ability to go into purchase orders and change them from purchase orders to credit purchase orders and vice versa without any checks or tests. This had more impact on clients using the Unvouchered Option in the Accounting period as it produce an out-of-balance gl transaction. In this release, validation has been added to lock this down. If the PO is in add mode, the user is allowed to switch between the Purchase and Credit types. Once the record has been added, however, the user must cancel the PO, and add it as the correct type. </P>
 <P>A registry entry (not recommended) is available to ignore this validation and restore the previous behavior and allow the PO Type to be changed on existing Purchase Orders: </P>

 <H2>3.3 Start Close Completed POs - Enhancements</H2>
 <P>Previously, this starter function generated a list of POs thought to be eligible to close.&nbsp; The basic eligibility requirements were:</P>
 <P>1. The Date Closed was not already set.<BR>2. PO was not type Credit.<BR>3. PO had to have one or more child lines.<BR>4. Each PO line had to be completely received.<BR><BR>The eligible POs were displayed in a list; POs marked for closing would have their Date Closed set when the user hit the GO button.</P>
 <P>Changes to this function include the following:</P>
 <P>1. The updating process now sets the PO's Received-in-Full flag and changes the PO Status to Closed.&nbsp; </P>
 <P>2. The function now determines which POs have been vouchered-in-full. The PO Vouchered-in-Full flag is also set during the update process if applicable.</P>
 <P>3. Credit-type POs are no longer excluded, however the criteria for closing a credit-type PO is based on vouchered-in-full instead of received-in-full.&nbsp; A PO Type Range been added to the so that the user can elect to include only Purchase or Credit type Purchase Orders. </P>
 <P>4. Since a PO must be fully received prior to becoming fully vouchered, it can be closed before reaching the fully vouchered state.&nbsp; For this reason, previously closed POs that haven't been fully vouchered are now included in the check list so that they can be flagged as fully-vouchered. If the Data Closed was previously set, it will not be changed by this function. If it was previously blank, it will be set to today’s date. </P>
 <P>5. The following columns have been added to the Checklist screen: </P>
 <P>&nbsp;Closed (Date): PO Type: Vouchered in Full</P>
 <H2>3.4 AP Journal </H2>
 <P>This release corrects a Key is Missing error that occurred when the user attempted to delete a Material Returns line from an existing Credit Memo. </P>
 <P>The registry option AttachCostsToARInvoiceForWO allows the user to attach vendor costs to AR Invoices when vouchering. In this release, attachment (whether manual or automatic) is no longer made to reversed AR Invoices.</P>
 <P>When attempting to delete a journal entry, the system now checks the status of the Accounting Period earlier in the process. This prevents inappropriate changes to the Check records of manual checks and credit card transactions associated with AP Journal entries for inactive accounting periods. </P>
 <P>If a manual checked is entered, and then deleted, and the user elects to reuse check#, the system will now allow the number to be reused.  </P>
 <P>This release corrects sporadic problem in Inventory History if an AP Journal entry for a PO referencing a Work Order with a difference location is deleted. </P>
 <P>The functionality to attach an AR Invoice to Purchase Orders has been extended to Credit PO’s. In addition, if the AR Invoice Id was defaulted for imported lines, manually entered General lines will also have the AR Invoice defaulted.  </P>
 <P>The system now denies changes to prepaid entries (where the<FONT style="font-weight:bold; " > </FONT>GL Account in the manual check section is completed). Previously, the system warned that the entry could not be changed, but then allowed the change.  </P>
 <P>Validation has been added to deny the deletion of AP entries if a manual check or EFT has reconciled in the Bank Reconciliation Journal.  The verification of reconciled check entries for multiple bank accounts is also supported.</P>
 <P>Corrects a problem with AP Journal edits to split stock/job po's resulted in history being writing to wrong location for the stock items.</P>
 <P>Corrects Tab Mismatch error entering sales tax if a Currency Id is specified. </P>
 <P>The AP Journals and the history records it generates will now assume the security id of the Purchase Order used to create the AP Journal entry. </P>
 <P>Previously, if the user attempted to change the EFT Trx Id on an existing entry, a message telling the user the field couldn’t be changed displayed, but did not actually prevent the user from changing it. In this release, the user is prevented from changing the field. </P>
 <P>If a work order was referenced on a purchase order, and there was no job cost history, the AR Invoice Id was set to 0 instead of to blank. This caused problems invoicing the work order. The AR Invoice Id is now set to blank in this case.</P>
 <P>Corrects a problem where the Effective Date was not ‘sticky’.</P>
 <P>The software now skips the update to the PO record when the AP Journal doesn't include a reference to a PO but the user has set the Close PO box. </P>
 <P>This release corrects a problem where, if a PO had the same exact description of the item in the General AND Inventory tabs, the AP Journal vouchering process doubled up the quantity on the General Tab of the AP Journal. </P>
 <H3>3.4.0 Close PO Box</H3>
 <P>The system now denies the ability to flag the Close PO box to any PO not fully received for both general and inventory lines. This validation has been added so that committed costs would not be left hanging for closed PO’s that were not fully received. </P>
 <P style="margin-left:36.00pt;"><FONT style="font-weight:bold; " >Note: PO’s that not allowed to Close</FONT><FONT style="font-weight:bold; " >:</FONT>  A problem may exist for General items received in the Inventory Received Journal – the cost was truncated, not rounded (e.g., .068 was truncated to .06 instead of being rounded to .070).  This problem has been corrected in the Inventory Receipts Journal so that the committed costs are now fully relieved (instead of being off by a penny(ies)) so that the AP Journal and Purchase Order viewer will allow the PO to be closed. <FONT style="font-weight:bold; " >If you have existing data</FONT> where this problem exists, the Start Close Completed PO function may be used to individually close these PO’s as it uses a different method of determining eligibility for closure. </P>
 <P style="margin-left:36.00pt;"><FONT style="font-weight:bold; " >Note On Finding and Closing PO’s that are Vouchered But Not Fully Received</FONT></P>
 <P style="margin-left:36.00pt;">The (DPMCCRPT) PM Committed Cost Report shows balance on outstanding commitments, as does (DPOOPEN) Open/Late PO's by Vendor. &nbsp;The Purchasing agent would have to audit these lists (preferably the open/late PO one) on a weekly basis and then go into each PO that should be complete and edit the quantities down to what's been received or delete cancelled lines. &nbsp;The user could then run the function to close PO's.</P>
 <H3>3.4.1 AP Journal General Tab</H3>
 <P>Validation has been added to the AP Journal to prohibit the entry of AR Control, AP Control &amp; Bank accounts on GEN lines.</P>
 <P>On AP Journal, when writing GL HISTORY transactions, the system used the ‘Transaction Description’ from AP Parent record (for GL Description) – instead of the CHILD description. This has been changed so that, when writing to GL, the general tab child description is used (if present). If the child description is blank, the AP Header description is used.</P>
 <H3>3.4.2 Taxes Tab</H3>
 <P style="margin-top:0;margin-bottom:0"> When clicking the Add Tax button, the user now receives an error message if the Invoice Total (entered directly by the user) does not exceed the Invoice Entered (calculated by the system).  Also, if a line is generated to a Tax Authority with a graduated rate, Tax Authority Id, GL Account, and Tax Base are completed so that the user can easily complete the information from the Vendor’s invoice. &nbsp;</P>
 <H3>3.4.3 Inventory Tab</H3>
 <P>Previously, when a credit PO was issued for a work order using a part on the inventory tab, the AP journal pulled the Inventory GL account instead of the direct material account (Job)  from the PO. The system now makes selective use of the PO Inventory line's GL Accounts and Entities based on the presence or absence of a Job Cost Code on the line. </P>
 <H3>3.4.4 New Equipment Id Field on Detail Lines</H3>
 <P>The Equipment Id field now appears after the Work Order Id on all detail tabs. When the user enters a Work Order Id in any of these tabs, the new default behavior is for the Equipment on the first line of the Work Order’s Equipment tab to default in. If the user double clicks on the Equipment Id field, the system will display a produce a list of all equipment associated to the referenced Client Site in the work order. The registry option detailed in user note 2.4.8 may be used to disable this behavior so that the Equipment Id does NOT default in.</P>
 <P>This enhancement also includes logic that will cause the Job, Cost Code, Billing Item to default from the entered Equipment Id if the DefaultJobByEquipmentId=true registry value is set. In this case, the system only defaults job values if equipment id is entered or changed (For example, if I enter in a equipment id that defaults Job A and I manually override the job to Job B, no other changes to line should cause the job to revert back to Job A unless I change the Equipment Id.</P>
 <H2>3.5 Vendor viewer</H2>
 <P>The Date Opened has been added to the filter range for this viewer.  This will allow the user to filter on Vendors that were added during a certain date range. </P>
 <H3>3.5.1 New Tabs</H3>
 <P>New Paid Invoice, and Payments tabs have been added to the Vendor viewer. </P>
 <P>Note: Double-clicking on a line exposes the Vendor Invoice if the user has access to it. If the user should be able to view but not change the Vendor Invoice, his User Group should be set to allow access but deny the Add, Edit and Delete rights.</P>
 <P><FONT style="font-weight:bold; " >Paid Invoices Tab</FONT></P>
 <P>This tab provides an invoices summary. The following fields are displayed: </P>
 <P style="margin-left:36.00pt;"><FONT style="font-weight:bold; " >InvoiceNo – POId – InvDate – DueDate – DatePaid – Purchases – Payments – DiscTaken</FONT></P>
 <P>Double-clicking on a line will open Vendor Invoice viewer to the selected record if access is allowed. Note that clicking on a column header sorts the tab by this column. </P>
 <P><FONT style="font-weight:bold; " >Payments Tab</FONT></P>
 <P>This tab provides information on individual payments you have made to this Vendor. </P>
 <P style="margin-left:36.00pt;"><FONT style="font-weight:bold; " >InvoiceNo – POId – CheckNo – CheckDate – Payments – DiscTaken - EntryType&nbsp;</FONT></P>
 <P>Double-clicking on a line will open Vendor Invoice viewer to the selected record if access is allowed. Note that clicking on a column header sorts the tab by this column. </P>
 <H3>3.5.2 Open Invoices Tab</H3>
 <P>Functionality has been added so that double-clicking on a line will open the Vendor Invoice viewer to the selected record if access is allowed. </P>
 <H2>3.6 AP Check </H2>
 <P>This build<FONT style="font-weight:bold; " > </FONT>corrects sporadic problem with AP zero dollar checks not getting recorded properly.  </P>
 <P>This build corrects an alignment problem in the details section of the check stub if the Invoice Amount was 10,000 or over.&nbsp;The details section of the check stub now uses Courier New Bold 8 pt. for each data column.&nbsp; Previously, the Description and InvoiceNo fields were  8 pt. and everything else was 10 pt.&nbsp;</P>
 <P>The fields for Invoice Amt, Amount Pd and Net Paid have been expanded to display up to $99,999,999.99 on the check stub. Corrects a problem where right-most digit on check stub was truncated on some printers. </P>
 <H2>3.7 Start Generate PO</H2>
 <P>Items purchased to Jobs are now correctly accounted for and not considered in the calculations. </P>
 <H2>3.8 PO Reorder Advice Report</H2>
 <P>Items purchased to Job are now correctly accounted for and not considered in the calculations. </P>
 <P><FONT style="font-weight:bold; " >New Field: Min/Max</FONT></P>
 <P>The Re-Order Advice Report now calculates the quantity to order the same way the Start Generate Purchase Order</P>
 <P>s does:</P>
 <P>The quantity needed is calculated based on the Order Up to field in the Inventory Item record (for a specified location) and how many items (if any) are already on order.  Items will not be considered to be needed  unless (On Hand + On Order) &lt; Reorder Level.  </P>
 <P style="margin-left:36.00pt;">- If an item is needed, the Maximum of the Reorder/Order Up to will be displayed in the Min/Max field.</P>
 <P style="margin-left:36.00pt;">- If an item is NOT needed, the Minimum (Reorder Level) will be displayed. </P>
 <P style="margin-left:36.00pt;"><FONT style="font-weight:bold; text-decoration:underline;" >Example 1: an item is needed<BR></FONT>Suppose widget001 has a Reorder Level of 20, an Order Up To of 25, and that 9 are On Hand and 7 are on order. In this case the Min/Max field will be 25 and the Needed field would be calculated as follows:  </P>
 <P style="margin-left:36.00pt;">&nbsp;Need=Order Up To - (On Hand + On Order) = 25 - (9 + 7) = 9</P>
 <P style="margin-left:36.00pt;"><FONT style="font-weight:bold; text-decoration:underline;" >Example 2: an item is not needed<BR></FONT>Suppose widget001 has a Reorder Level of 20, an Order Up To of 25, and that 14 are On Hand and 7 are on order. In this case the Min/Max field will be 20 and the Needed field would be 0 because On Hand + On Order (21) exceed the Reorder level.    </P>
 <H2>3.9 AP Check Void</H2>
 <P>This function now supports Security validation. If the user specifies a check with security that he does not have rights to, the system will display the message “Your current user security does not allow you to void checks generated with security id ###.’</P>
 <H2>3.10 AP Date To Pay List</H2>
 <P>An invoice Number field has been added to the right-hang side of the AP Date To Pay list that displays the entire Vendor Invoice number. </P>
 <H2>3.11 AP Terms</H2>
 <P>Validation has been added to prevent both the Pay-When-Paid and Requires Approval boxes from being checked when an AP Terms record is added or saved. </P>
 <H2>3.12 Purchase Order </H2>
 <P>When adding a Purchase Order, the system will compare the Release Date with the PO header Job’s Date Closed. If the Release Date exceeds the Job’s Date Closed, the Purchase Order will not be saved. Note that if the Release Date is not completed, the system date will be used for the comparison.&nbsp;</P>
 <P>Credit PO's (both vouchered and not yet vouchered) can now be un-received (previously, only vouchered Credit PO’s could be un-received). </P>
 <P>Corrects a recent display problem with the extended price of Inventory on the printed purchase order. </P>
 <P>Previously, when a stock PO was created a Job Cost Category (but no Job),  spurious job history with a committed cost and quantity (but no Job) was generated. In this release, changes to the Purchase Order, AP Journal and Inventory Receipts journals have been made to correct this problem. </P>
 <P>If a Vendor is associated with a Rate Schedule, entering an Other Rate will now default in the Unit Cost and the Extended Cost on the Other tab at the same time. </P>
 <P>Corrects spurious error changing the Vendor on a PO with no items after receiving on another PO. </P>
 <P>The system now applies the AutoFillReceived registry setting (from sys-viewer-vprchseordrlst)  when making Subcontractor POs (e.g., when PO’s are created for a subcontractor in Create PM Work Orders). Note that even if autofill is enabled by registry, checking the Vendor field Disable PO Autofill prevents the autofill.</P>
 <P>Corrects an auto-loading problem that resulted in the Tax Group/Tax Type being cleared when the WO Id was cleared. The revised code only affects the PO-INV data entry.&nbsp; </P>
 <P>Corrects problem with single-quote characters embedded in Other Descriptions.</P>
 <P>Database conversion now sets the currency factor to 1.0 if it was erroreously set to 0 in existing Purchase Orders. </P>
 <H3>3.12.1 New Equipment Id Field on Detail Lines</H3>
 <P>The Equipment Id field now appears after the Work Order Id on all detail tabs. When the user enters a Work Order Id in any of these tabs, the new default behavior is for the Equipment on the first line of the Work Order’s Equipment tab to default in. If the user double clicks on the Equipment Id field, the system will display a produce a list of all equipment associated to the referenced Client Site in the work order. The registry option detailed in user note 2.4.8 may be used to disable this behavior so that the Equipment Id does NOT default in.</P>
 <P>This enhancement also includes logic that will cause the Job, Cost Code, Billing Item to default from the entered Equipment Id if the DefaultJobByEquipmentId=true registry value is set. In this case, the system only defaults job values if equipment id is entered or changed (For example, if I enter in a equipment id that defaults Job A and I manually override the job to Job B, no other changes to line should cause the job to revert back to Job A unless I change the Equipment Id.</P>
 <H3>3.12.2  Purchase Order Remit To Tab:  </H3>
 <P>The Mail To field on this tab now works correctly; if you select a Vendor Mail To address, the Remit To address will be set from it. Notice that the Mail To field is present for data entry and is not stored in the database for this tab: the Mail To Id will not be retained when you return to the Purchase Order.</P>
 <P style="margin-left:36.00pt;"><FONT style="font-weight:bold; " >Registry Option to Deny Users Access to the PO’s Remit To Tab</FONT></P>

 <H3>3.12.3 Subcontract Tab</H3>
 <P>The system now allows negative Contract values on PO-SUB lines. The system will warn the user when a negative value is entered, but will allow the PO to be saved. </P>
 <P style="margin-left:36.00pt;">&nbsp;</P>
 <H1>4. Client, Site, Equipment </H1>
 <H2>4.1 Client Viewer</H2>
 <P>Display of Credit Memos and Unapplied Case Receipts:  Prior to this case, values in the column titled InvAmt showed as a positive amount for both Credit Memo and Unapplied Cash transactions.&nbsp; These amounts have been changed to negative values.  </P>
 <H3>4.1.1 Client Collections Screen</H3>
 <P>This release corrects a display issue in the Payments section of the Collections screen – commas were being included in the Check No. column. </P>
 <H2>4.2 Client Site Viewer</H2>
 <P>The Call Script Id field on the Main tab has been relabeled to reflect its function: WO Closing Call Script id. </P>
 <P>The<FONT style="font-weight:bold; " > </FONT>Security Id has been restored to this viewer (scroll down on Main tab).</P>
 <H2>4.3 Client Site Equipment Viewer</H2>

 <H2>5.3 Other Rate viewer</H2>

 <H2>5.5 Consolidated Invoice Viewer</H2>
 <P>This release corrects a display issue where the Work Order Id was blanked out when the Consolidated Invoice record was re-displayed. Also corrects a problem with Credit Memos (with negative amounts) which were not redisplayed correctly (the negative amounts were being displayed as positive).</P>
 <H2>5.6 Record Billing Adjustments</H2>
 <P>Rounding Logic has been added to retainage calculations. This should correct sporadic problems where the retainage was off by a penny or two.   </P>
 <P>Record Billing Adjustments now recognizes and uses the security and branch override from the job/security registry settings in sys-ffv-global-settings. </P>
 <P>If the Billing Item's Original Contract Amount or Contract Change amount is negative, when you enter 100% for the contract earned percentage, the total now equals the value exactly instead of being off by a few cents.</P>
 <P><IMG src="images/computegl.gif" align=left border=0 height=17 width=77 alt="images\computegl.gif"> The Compute GL button now understands there might be a GL Income Account in the Cost Category and includes it in the computations. The revenue is allocated to GL Accounts based on the cost codes and/or cost categories that have posted to JCH.</P>
 <P style="margin-left:36.00pt;"><FONT style="font-weight:bold; " >Background Information:</FONT></P>
 <P style="margin-left:36.00pt;">There are four allocation schemes that could potentially be used in RBA when the COMPUTE GL button is pushed.&nbsp; The first one that 'qualifies' is the one used for any given billing item.&nbsp; The possibilities, in order of precedence, are ...<BR><BR>1. Budgeted Revenue by Billing Item, Cost Code, GL Account<BR>2. Unbilled Costs by Billing Item, Cost Code, GL Account<BR>3. Projected Costs by Billing Item, Cost Code, GL Account<BR>4. Budgeted Costs by Billing Item, Cost Code, GL Account<BR><BR><FONT style="font-weight:bold; " >NOTE:<BR></FONT>When none of the above allocation schemes can be used, the Cost Code designated as the Default for AR is used.&nbsp; If there is no default, then the cost code with the lowest Id is used.</P>
 <H3>5.6.1 Record Billing Adjustments – Pre-pending Branch Prefix on Invoice Id: </H3>
 <P>If the registry options defaultBranchFrom=job and BranchSequence=nextinvce are in place in sys-ffv-global-settings, the branch prefix for invoices generated from this function now comes from the branch referenced job, not the user. If defaultBranchFrom=job is not enabled, but BranchSequence=nextinvce is, the branch prefix for invoices generated from this function now comes from the branch referenced in the user record.</P>
 <H2>5.7 Compute Service Invoices</H2>
 <P>Corrects a problem where sales tax was assessed on Use Tax jobs when the Max Tax per Invoice protocol was implemented via registry (SalesTaxMaxPerInvoice=true in sys-ffv-global-settings). </P>
 <P>COD Invoices will now be be posted to both the AR Sales Journal AND the AR Cash Receipts Journal to be more in line with TechAnywhere functionality. The registry entry detailed in user note 2.18.2 may be used to restore the old behavior (just post to AR Sales). </P>
 <P style="margin-left:36.00pt;"><FONT style="font-weight:bold; " >U</FONT><FONT style="font-weight:bold; " >pdated Report to Install:</FONT> Service Invoice Posting Report</P>
 <P style="margin-left:36.00pt;">The Service Invoice Posting report has been updated to support the new behavior. The new version of this report (dated 1/21/2010 or later) must be installed to support this functionality. </P>
 <P>Corrects a problem related to Invoice Archiving validations that prevented the user from double-clicking on the  Accounting Period Id or Date fields from Compute Service Invoices.&nbsp; The ability to right-click to open the Accounting Period is not allowed.</P>
 <P>Previously, we added validation to compute service invoice so that if the work order's job was missing a billing item in job history OR the billing item was not marked ok to billing a workspace detailed the error would appear. Unfortunately, the workspace only mentions that a billing item may be missing - not that it's ok to bill box is clear. The revised message in the in the workspace reads as follows:</P>
 <P style="margin-left:36.00pt;">The following Work Orders cannot be invoiced.<BR>Each has one or more JCH entries that:<BR>&nbsp;do not contain a Billing Item or<BR>&nbsp;reference a Billing Item that is not flagged as Ok to Bill.</P>
 <H2>5.8 AR Sales Journal</H2>
 <P>Corrects a sporadic problem using the Create Credit Memo Button for a COP posting where the line amounts did not total correctly.</P>
 <P>This release corrects a problem in recent releases that did not allow Job / Client fields to be entered directly for manual entries.</P>
 <P>Enhanced validation has been implemented to deny changes to the Invoice Id for previously posted AR Sales entries and to insure that the specified Invoice Id must be appropriate for users’ security settings.</P>
 <P>Previously, we added a warning when the user clicked the Create CM button if the invoice balance did not equal the invoice total. The message has been improved so that if the invoice balance is zero, the message now displays as the following instead of display a blank instead of 0:  </P>
 <P style="margin-left:36.00pt;">“Warning: Invoice Balance is Zero and does not equal Invoice Total: 79.54. Do you want to continue?”</P>
 <P>The “Show Invoice” button now displays the appropriate Invoice (if invoices are archived), not the customer’s check scanned in as part of Cash Receipts processing.  </P>
 <P><FONT style="font-weight:bold; " >New Field: Invoice Balance:</FONT> When you open an existing AR Sales Journal entry, the system now displays the invoice balance (0.00 if the invoice is fully paid). </P>
 <P><FONT style="font-weight:bold; " >Changed Button: Create Credit Memo</FONT><FONT style="font-weight:bold; " >:  </FONT>When this button is clicked, the system checks the Invoice Balance and displays a soft warning if the balance is less than the CM would be for.</P>
 <P>Validation has been added so that you cannot press the Credit Memo Button with a GL Account in the Cash Receipts field (generated by a COD entry). </P>
 <P>Validation has been added so that a Credit Memo cannot be created from a Sales Journal entry that has already been changed.&nbsp;</P>
 <P>Validation has been added to prevent AR Sales Journal entries from being changed FROM type Credit Memo to type Sales.  If the viewer is in Add Mode, the user must re-start the transaction to make a Sales-type entry.</P>
 <P>Implements Security overrides (if SecurityOverrideFrom=job is set in sys-ffv-global-settings) for manually created Sales Journal entries.</P>
 <P>Also implements setting the Branch Rn from the User record (if BranchOverrideFrom=job is NOT set) for manually created Sales Journal entries. </P>
 <H3>5.8.1 GL Tab </H3>
 <P>The system now denies changes to COD type AR Sales Journal entries that have been processed in the Bank Deposit Journal. The message “This COD sale has already been deposited. Changes to this transaction are not allowed.” Note that the user may still use the Credit Memo button to generate a Credit Memo (as this creates a NEW entry). </P>
 <P><FONT style="font-weight:bold; " >New Fields: Bank Deposit:<BR>Transaction Id: Effective Date:</FONT></P>
 <P>If this is a COD-type Sales Journal Entry  (with the Cash Receipt fields completed), the system will display the Bank Deposit information that is record when the COD funds are  recorded in the Bank Deposit Journal. The system denies changes to entries that have been processed in the Bank Deposit Journal.</P>
 <H3>5.8.2 Prices Tab</H3>
 <P>Validation has been added to prohibit the entry of AP Control accounts on Prices lines.<BR></P>
 <H2>5.9 Job Invoice Post</H2>
 <P>This function<FONT style="font-weight:bold; " > </FONT>now supports the SecurityOverrideFrom=job functionality in the sys-ffv-global-setting registry. </P>
 <P>The Retainage GL Account ID is now displayed on the Job Invoice Post Report. </P>
 <H2>5.10 AR Cash Receipts Journal</H2>
 <P>The AR Cash Receipts Journal now allows the header and line Client Ids to be different.&nbsp; This allows cash receipts to be recorded for the client that received the invoice.&nbsp; Previously, the AR Cash Receipts Journal Entries couldn't be recorded without switching the Job Client Id back to match the original invoice.</P>
 <H2>5.11 Start Job Invoice Reverse</H2>
 <P>The Job Invoice Reverse function now posts the reversing Sales Journal entry using the Client Id from the original invoice instead of the Job Client Id.&nbsp; </P>
 <H2>5.12 Sales Tax Group </H2>
 <P>Corrects a problem writing the Group Rate to the database when setting or clearing the Job Cost flag. </P>
 <H2>5.13 AR History Report</H2>
 <P>A new range, WorkOrder Id, has been added to Report AR History (this is a system report – it does not need to be imported into your database). This enables the user to filter the report more finely. </P>
 <H2>5.14 Create PM Invoice</H2>
 <P>This release corrects an error that occurred when RININV4 was used for PM Invoicing. </P>

 <H2>6.3 GL Journal</H2>
 <P><FONT style="font-weight:bold; " >Operation Lockdown Validations<BR></FONT>The GL Journal now refuses the use of any GL Account that is intended to be used with only direct or indirect jobs.&nbsp; Ideally, you could say that 'All' should also be excluded but that is considered acceptable to preserve all original behavior for installations that choose not to implement any of the Operation Lockdown functionality.</P>
 <H2>6.4 Bank Deposit Journal</H2>
 <P>Validation now prevents the Bank GL Account (in the record parent) and the GL Account on the Other Tab lines from being the same. </P>
 <P>Validations now prevent the sweep account from being changed in existing entries, and in new entries where lines have been added via Autoload button or on the Other tab.</P>
 <P>In this release, the Auto Fill functionality is now sensitive to the transaction's Effective Date; receipts newer than the Effective Date will not be pulled in. </P>
 <P>This version Improves performance when accessing large amounts of data. </P>
 <P>Validations have been added to prevent changes to entries recorded in the Bank Reconciliation Journal. Deposits must first be un-reconciled before Bank Deposit changes can be made. </P>
 <P><IMG src="images/checkoff.gif" align=left border=0 height=28 width=48 alt="images\checkoff.gif"> <IMG src="images/check.gif" align=left border=0 height=28 width=48 alt="images\check.gif"> <FONT style="font-weight:bold; " >New Buttons: Clear All</FONT><FONT style="font-weight:bold; " >, Check All</FONT><BR>When you click the Auto Fill Transactions button, outstanding receipts will be imported; all lines will be checked. The  Clear All button may be clicked to clear all items (if just a few checks should be selected). </P>
 <P>The Check All button selects all Receipts.</P>
 <P>Corrects spurious error &quot;receipt is already recorded as deposit in journal entry:- “ that occurred if you cleared and rechecked a deposit that was eligible for a previously recorded entry.  </P>
 <H3>6.4.1 Receipts Tab</H3>
 <P>This tab now uses List panes that can be sorted. The ‘Dp’ column on the Receipts tab has been replaced by a Clear column that performs the same function.</P>
 <P style="margin-left:36.00pt;"><FONT style="font-weight:bold; " >New Field - Clear:<BR></FONT>By default all “auto-loaded” entries that precede the “effective date” are set to Yes. Toggle this box (by double-clicking on it or pressing Spacebar when the caret is on it) to clear if you do not wish to flag this check as deposited.  Only lines set to Yes will be selected for deposit. </P>
 <P>Additional fields have been added to the Receipts tab of this viewer to make it easier for users to better identify the checks that they are now depositing. The following fields are now displayed:</P>
 <P>Check # (the check or EFT number from the AP Journal)<BR>Client Name (from the Client record)<BR>Check Amount:<BR>Invoice Id: (will display as *Various* if the check or EFT covered multiple invoices)<BR>Reference Id: (the work order, job, or client order: will display as *Various* if multiple items)<BR>CRJ#: (the AR Cash Receipts Journal entry number)<BR>SJ#: (the AR Sales Journal Number – for COD deposits)<BR>Reference Name: (the name from the associated Job, if available)<BR>Reference Type: (Client Order, Job (construction invoices) or Work Order (Service Invoices))</P>
 <H2>6.5 Bank Reconciliation Journal </H2>
 <P>This journal now restricts all auto-fill action based on Effective Date; checks, deposits and transfers dated after the Effective Date you enter will not be imported. Previously, checks, deposits and transfers dated after the Effective Date were imported but not checked. </P>
 <P>This release Improves performance when accessing large amounts of data. </P>
 <P>This version prevents the user from changing previously 'finalized' Bank Reconciliation Journal transactions.&nbsp; A transaction becomes 'finalized' as soon as a newer Reconciliation transaction is recorded for the same Bank Account. When the user accesses a finalized transaction, the user is informed that the transaction cannot be changed. The Change button in a finalized transaction is disabled.</P>
 <P>Previously, when editing and existing entry, only one Check line could be checked / cleared; in this version, multiple lines may be adjusted if needed.  </P>
 <P>The AP Journal post to the Check table now correctly writes a negative amount for ‘credit’ EFT and Credit card transactions.  This results in these transactions being correctly displayed in the Bank Rec journal. Historical data should be adjusted via SQL; see your support rep for details.</P>
 <P><FONT style="font-weight:bold; " >Change to Tab For</FONT><FONT style="font-weight:bold; " >mat: Checks – Deposits – Transfers To – Transfers From</FONT></P>
 <P><FONT style="font-weight:bold; " >New Column: Clear</FONT>   (replaces the CL column)<BR>This enhancement enables users to re-sort data on the various child tabs of the Bank Reconciliation Journal by simply clicking on the desired column header.&nbsp; To support this functionality, the child tabs have been converted to list tabs; the user will use the single mouse click to toggle the Clear column between Yes (to clear the item) or blank (the item will not be cleared).</P>
 <H2>6.6 Recurring GL Journal </H2>
 <P>The following fixes have been implemented to prevent out of balance entries: </P>
 <P style="margin-left:36.00pt;">If you Delete lines, the totals on top are now updated. </P>
 <P style="margin-left:36.00pt;">If you elect to Copy lines (from insert), the totals on top are correctly updated. </P>
 <P style="margin-left:36.00pt;">On an existing entry, change a debit or credit amount but do NOT tab out of the field will now longer allow you to save the entry OOB.</P>
 <H3>6.6.1 New TrxHistory Tab</H3>
 <P>In previous releases, it was up to the user to ensure that recurring journal entries were only run once per accounting period. The following new functionality has been added to help users to only run this function appropriately: </P>
 <P>1. A new tab, TrxHistory, has been added to show GL Journal activity posted for a recurring transaction.</P>
 <P>2. Validation has been added to Start Release Recurring GL to prevent duplication of recurring entries within the same Accounting Period. If the use attempts to do so, the message “Transaction has already been released and posted for this Period” will be displayed and the user will be prevented from completing the operation. </P>
 <H2>6.7 GL Report Writer</H2>
 <P>The new row types StartEntty and EndEntty have been implemented.</P>
 <P><FONT style="font-weight:bold; " >BeginEntty<BR>EndEntty:</FONT></P>
 <P>Tip:  These can only be used when running the report with the Consolidate box UNCHECKED.</P>
 <P>Use these Row Types in pairs to restrict subsequent rows functionality within the identified Entities.</P>
 <P><FONT style="text-decoration:underline;" >Example:</FONT></P>
 <P>BeginEntty&nbsp;Entty1, Entty3, Entty8</P>
 <P>AccntSum&nbsp;88888, 99999 &nbsp;&nbsp;(Total something account)</P>
 <P>EndEntty&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;(EndEntty is set to blank)</P>
 <P>This will Sum the balances of account 88888 and 99999 restricted to Entty1, Entty3, and Entty8</P>
 <H2>6.8 GL Reporting</H2>
 <P>When a GL report is run, it now only looks at the GL Account security, regardless of the security associated with the GL Transaction. Previously, the report was “pre-filtering” GL transactions based on the Security of the GL Account itself and therefore was not showing everything that had the correct history security.</P>
 <H2>6.9 Bank Transfer Journal</H2>
 <P>This release corrects a sporadic problem where the header Description was blanked.</P>
 <P>The user is now prevented from editing a Bank Transfer Journal entry that has been Reconciled in the Bank Reconciliation journal.  The user will also be warned when accessing a Reconciled entry.</P>
 <P style="margin-top:0;margin-bottom:0">&nbsp;</P>
 <H1>7. Job Costing</H1>
 <H2>7.1. Job Viewer</H2>
 <P>When using the Prevailing Wage logic on a job, the job cost calculated for overtime was incorrect in earlier versions. This has been corrected in this release so that the job cost is no longer inflated.</P>
 <P>If you click the sidebar button Create PO in a Job record and the system date (today) exceeds the Job’s Date Closed, the message ‘Cannot Create Job PO for closed Job’ will be displayed; the Purchase Order viewer will not be launched. &nbsp; </P>
 <P>Previously, if the CloneJobEquipmentExistingSite registry was enabled, cloning the job resulted the existing site having it’s PM Billing lines changed to the newest job. In this release, the Site’s PM Billing Schedule is not changed as a result of the clone. </P>
 <P>Corrects a problem if the registry option ClonePMInspectionSchedule=true is enabled. The PM Schedule now points to the new job being created.</P>
 <P>Due to the massive amounts of data that may be included for COD and Template jobs, displaying the Revenues, Invoices and Purchases tabs of these viewers was sometimes resulting in an &quot;out of memory - unable to continue&quot; message. In this release,  the system will not populate these tabs if the Job is flagged as a Template, or if the Job does not reference a Client Site. </P>
 <P><FONT style="font-weight:bold; " >New Create PO button<BR></FONT><IMG src="images/createpo.gif" align=left border=0 height=28 width=48 alt="images\createpo.gif"><FONT style="font-weight:bold; " > </FONT><FONT style="font-weight:bold; " > </FONT>A new Create PO button has been added to the side button bar of the Job Viewer.

Updated versions of the Service Invoice and Service Billing Worksheet must be installed to implement this functionality.</P>
 <P style="margin-left:72.00pt;"><FONT style="font-weight:bold; " >Tip:</FONT> If the auto<FONT style="font-weight:bold; " >-</FONT>emailing of service invoices is implemented on your system, and Billing Address records are used, the Email Invoices field in the Billing Address record should always be completed.

 <P style="margin-left:72.00pt;">&nbsp;</P>
 <P>In this release, the<FONT style="font-weight:bold; " > </FONT>Budget Cost, Projected Cost and Budget Revenue were added to the Billing Items tab.</P>
 <H3>7.1.1 New Tab: Budget Entry</H3>
 <H3>Purpose:</H3>
 <P>Entries made in this tab will be written to Job History as Budget entries.  Edits and changes to this lines will also be written to JCH.  This tab also allows for the import of budget data from a .csv spreadsheet.</P>
 <H3>Usage:</H3>
 <P>The new Budget Entry child tab provides a quick way to record budgets for small jobs, but does not replace the Job Journal budgeting functionality. Users that record Budget Changes should generally continue to use the Job Journal as the budget entry point.</P>
 <P>Note that Budget lines are NOT cloned when a Job is cloned. </P>
 <P style="margin-left:36.00pt;"><FONT style="font-weight:bold; " >Editing Budget Entries: <BR></FONT>The Budget tab functions like the other SAM Pro journals.  If it is necessary to change a line, simply change it to the desired value and save the record. If you firm needs Budget Change functionality, the Job Journal should be used to record Budgets. </P>
 <H3>Important Fields:</H3>
 <P><FONT style="font-weight:bold; " >Hours:</FONT><FONT style="font-weight:bold; " >  Quantity:</FONT><FONT style="font-weight:bold; " ><BR></FONT>The Hours fields should be used to record labor budgets lines, and the Quantity field should be used to record material or other items. On a single line, fill in either the Hours or Quantity field. </P>
 <P><FONT style="font-weight:bold; " >Inventory Item:<BR></FONT>This option field would be used if you are budgeting for specific parts. Note that the cost / revenue for this part must be specified by the user (or imported from a spreadsheet); these values will not default from inventory history. </P>
 <P><FONT style="font-weight:bold; " >Cost Category:<BR></FONT>Enter (or import) an appropriate Job Cost Category for this line. For example, a Cost Category of type Labor should be selected for Hours entries. This field is required.</P>
 <P><FONT style="font-weight:bold; " >Job Cost Code:  Job Billing Item:</FONT><FONT style="font-weight:bold; " ><BR></FONT>The Cost Code and Billing Item this budget is assigned to. These fields are required. </P>
 <P><FONT style="font-weight:bold; " >Unit Cost:  Extended Cost:</FONT><BR>The Unit Cost must be entered by the user or imported a spreadsheet. If entering the budget manually, the system will multiply the Hours or Quantity by the Unit Cost to calculate the extended cost. </P>
 <P><FONT style="font-weight:bold; " >Billing Type:</FONT><FONT style="font-weight:bold; " >  Revenue Rate:  Extended Revenue:</FONT><FONT style="font-weight:bold; " ><BR></FONT>By default, the billing type is set to n/a so that the user can enter/import the Revenue directly.  To have the system calculate the Extended Revenue for you, select a Billing Type and enter a Revenue Rate.</P>
 <H3>Important Buttons:</H3>
 <P><IMG src="images/importbudget.gif" align=left border=0 height=28 width=48 alt="images\importbudget.gif"> The Import Budget button may be used to import budget data from an estimator’s spreadsheet (see below for the format details).</P>
 <P>When you click this button, the system will determine how any existing budget lines should be handled: </P>
 <P style="margin-left:36.00pt;">Click 'Yes' to REPLACE all existing lines on the Budget tab. <BR>Click 'No' to ADD the imported lines to the Budget tab. <BR>Click 'Cancel' to end the import without updating the budget lines.</P>
 <P>If you click Yes (to replace) or No (to add the imported lines to the existing ones), a browser window will open. Browse to the desired spreadsheet and click Save. </P>
 <P>If the system detects any problems with the spreadsheet, it will display them.  The spreadsheet must be corrected before it can be imported. You may print and then close the ‘workspace’ listing of errors. </P>
 <P>Once the Budget lines have been imported, remember to Save the Job record. Doing so will make the appropriate budget entries to Job History. </P>
 <H3>Spreadsheet Format:</H3>
 <P>The system expects a spreadsheet with 9 columns. During the import to the Budget tab, SAM Pro will validate that the formatting is correct, and that any referenced Inventory, Cost Code, Cost Category and Billing Item Id’s exist.  </P>
 <P>The first row should include only column titles, listed in bold below.</P>
 <P>Column 1: <FONT style="font-weight:bold; " >Hours</FONT> – numeric field for labor budget lines – ######.## max</P>
 <P>Column 2: <FONT style="font-weight:bold; " >Quantity</FONT><FONT style="font-weight:bold; " > </FONT>- numeric field for material and other budget lines – #####.### max</P>

 <P>Column 8: <FONT style="font-weight:bold; " >Bill Item</FONT> – text field, must correspond to a valid Job Billing Item for this Job – 30 alphanumeric max</P>
 <P>Column 9: <FONT style="font-weight:bold; " >Description</FONT> – text field; optionally used to enter a description – 40 alphanumeric max</P>
 <H3>7.1.2 New Tab: User Fields</H3>
 <P>The existing Job Users fields </P>
 <H3>7.1.3  New Tab: JC Summary</H3>
 <P>The new JC Summary tab displays a Job Cost summary, as well as Job Progress information similar to that available on the Project Manager Summary Report. This tab also includes Aged AR and Budget information. </P>
 <H3>7.1.4 Invoices Tab </H3>
 <P>This release includes minor changes to the Job Invoice reverse. An SQL to fix the failed posting retroactively is available – contact your support rep for details.  </P>
 <H3>7.1.5  'Unknown' Tax Status</H3>
 <P>If the Job Tax Status buttons or the Tax Group Tax fields are changed,  when the Save button is pressed the system now reviews Job History lines and set all lines for this job that do NOT have an AR Invoice ID or are of Tax Type Use to ' n/a' (space n/a) so that they will be successfully re-evaluated at invoice time. </P>
 <P>This enhancement addresses the situation where the tax status of a job cannot be initially determined.</P>
 <P style="margin-left:36.00pt;"><FONT style="font-weight:bold; " >Job Record</FONT><FONT style="font-weight:bold; " >: </FONT></P>
 <P style="margin-left:36.00pt;">A fourth option, Unknown, has been added to the Job Tax Status field.&nbsp; The Job Tax Status radio buttons have been reordered so that ‘Unknown’ appears first, and will be the default when a blank Job record is displayed.  </P>
 <P style="margin-left:36.00pt;">The Tax Type Id will be set to unknown (' n/a') for jobs with an unknown tax status and is designed for those cases where it cannot be determined if a job should be set to a status of Sales or Exempt. Once the status of the Job has been changed from Unknown to Sales or Exempt, Job and Service Invoicing can be run, and will successfully evaluate the tax (or exempt amounts) for the invoice. </P>
 <P style="margin-left:36.00pt;">Validation logic regarding manual edits of line-item Tax Type Ids has been added. Changes at the line-item level are not permitted for jobs with an unknown tax status.</P>
 <P style="margin-left:72.00pt;">When job tax is 'sales', valid types are 'sales' 'n/a' 'prepaid'<BR>When job tax is 'exempt', valid types are 'exempt' 'n/a' 'prepaid'<BR>When job tax is 'use', valid types are 'use' 'n/a' 'prepaid'</P>
 <P style="margin-left:36.00pt;">Note that the system may default in a tax type of ‘mixed’ but the user is not allowed to select this type. Note that the system would generate the ‘mixed’ type if, for example, a sales tax group was comprised of two authorities, one of whom taxed Other item, and one of whom did not. </P>
 <P style="margin-left:36.00pt;"><FONT style="font-weight:bold; " >Work Order</FONT></P>
 <P style="margin-left:36.00pt;">When a work order is set to Invoice Ready, warn the user if the job's tax status is unknown and deny the user the ability to print the invoice.</P>
 <P style="margin-left:36.00pt;"><FONT style="font-weight:bold; " >Service Worksheet</FONT></P>
 <P style="margin-left:36.00pt;">The Newest Service Worksheet displays Unknown tax message if tax status is set to Unknown: this report must be imported into your data.</P>
 <P style="margin-left:36.00pt;"><FONT style="font-weight:bold; " >Report Service Invoice</FONT></P>
 <P style="margin-left:36.00pt;">The Service Invoice now skips all jobs with unknown tax status.</P>
 <P style="margin-left:36.00pt;"><FONT style="font-weight:bold; " >Record Billing Adjustments</FONT></P>
 <P style="margin-left:36.00pt;">This function may not be used on jobs with tax status of unknown. </P>
 <P style="margin-left:36.00pt;"><FONT style="font-weight:bold; " >QuoteMaster</FONT></P>
 <P style="margin-left:36.00pt;">Jobs with Tax Status of ‘Unknown’ are now excluded from selection as lead work orders, and in the Quote Master Wizard. </P>
 <P>Note: also see user note 2.4.2 for a registry setting that defers the evaluation of the Tax Type until invoicing. </P>
 <H3>7.1.6 Validations to Client Id in Job</H3>
 <P>In this release, if Retainage has been billed the Client Id cannot be changed.&nbsp; This validation can be changed from an error to a warning  with the registry setting in user note 2.13.2.</P>
 <P>The AR Cash Receipts Journal now allows the header and line Client Ids to be different.&nbsp; This allows cash receipts to be recorded for the client that received the invoice.&nbsp; Previously, the AR Cash Receipts Journal Entries couldn't be recorded without switching the Job Client Id back to match the original invoice.</P>
 <P>The Job Invoice Reverse function now posts the reversing Sales Journal entry using the Client Id from the original invoice instead of the Job Client Id.&nbsp; </P>
 <P style="margin-top:0;margin-bottom:0">&nbsp;</P>
 <H2>7.2  New Format of the Job Billing Item Viewer</H2>
 <P>This release corrects a problem where the user couldn’t click in the Fee Taxable Box.  </P>
 <P>Note: In previous releases, the user was prevented from changing the Job Id if references to the Billing Item were found in Job History. Unfortunately, this validation also prevented the user from being able to ‘clone’ billing items by accessing a billing item, and then changing the Job Id (to a job that did not have a corresponding billing item item). This implementation has been changed so that, if the user does so, the viewer will change to ‘add’ mode to allow the new record to be created. </P>
 <H3>Purpose:</H3>
 <P>The system now supports a greater distinction between Billing Items that are Change Orders and those that are not.&nbsp; Note that these different viewers do NOT change the basic functionality associated with Billing Items. </P>
 <P>Depending on how your system is set up (see the Registry Entries section) you may:</P>
 <P style="margin-left:36.00pt;">- Use the Job Billing Item viewer for Billing Items and Change Orders (on the Change Order Tab). -</P>
 <P style="margin-left:36.00pt;">- Use the Change Order viewer (see user note 7.3) for Change Orders, and the Job Billing Item Viewer exclusively for items that are not Change Orders.  </P>
 <P style="margin-left:36.00pt;"><FONT style="font-weight:bold; " >Upgrade Notes:<BR></FONT>During the data conversion, a Job Billing Item will be flagged as Change Order if any of the following fields have been set: Contract Changes, C.O. Date Requested, and C.O. Date Approved. However, a Billing Item will not be flagged as a Change Order if the Original Contract Amount field is completed, regardless of how the above fields are set. </P>
 <H3>Usage: </H3>
 <P>Referenced in Records: Work Order, Client Site, Purchase Order, Shop Order, Job Cost Code. <BR>Referenced in Journals: Job, AP, Inventory/PO Receipt, Labor, AR Sales, and Cash Receipts. </P>
 <P>Job Billing Items attached to Job Template records may only be edited by users with access to Job Templates via their User Groups. </P>
 <H3>Registry Entries:</H3>
 <P>A related registry entry may be enabled to limit the Job Billing Item Viewer to ONLY those records that are not Change Orders: see user note 2.6 for details. </P>

 <H3>7.5.1 New Equipment Id Field on Detail Lines</H3>
 <P>The Equipment Id field now appears after the Work Order Id on all detail tabs. When the user enters a Work Order Id in any of these tabs, the new default behavior is for the Equipment on the first line of the Work Order’s Equipment tab to default in. If the user double clicks on the Equipment Id field, the system will display a produce a list of all equipment associated to the referenced Client Site in the work order. The registry option detailed in user note 2.4.8 may be used to disable this behavior so that the Equipment Id does NOT default in.</P>
 <P>This enhancement also includes logic that will cause the Job, Cost Code, Billing Item to default from the entered Equipment Id if the DefaultJobByEquipmentId=true registry value is set. In this case, the system only defaults job values if equipment id is entered or changed (For example, if I enter in a equipment id that defaults Job A and I manually override the job to Job B, no other changes to line should cause the job to revert back to Job A unless I change the Equipment Id.</P>
 <H2>7.6 Job Progress viewer</H2>
 <P>This release corrects a reported problem with calculation of Margin % in Job Progress Viewer. This problem was caused by the budgeted revenue amount being truncated in the work area.  </P>
 <P>The Job Progress viewer now allows the user to look at progress data older than the most recent data.&nbsp; The Change button is disabled to prevent changes when reviewing the historical data. When the user accesses historical data, the system will display a message “Progress already reported through (most recent date). Additional revisions dated (historical date) not permitted.”</P>
 <P><FONT style="font-weight:bold; " >New Field: Reported Thru</FONT><BR>The Job Progress parent form already included an effective date field that was used during the posting of the progress updates to JCH.&nbsp; Changes to this viewer include: </P>
 <P>1. The parent form now shows the latest 'progress' effective date in the JCH as the Reported Date.<BR>2. The child lines are now computed when the user enters an Effective Date.<BR>3. The 'new' Effective Date cannot precede the Reported Date (if it has been set).</P>
 <H2>7.7 Job Cost EOM</H2>
 <P>Progress meters have been added to this function.&nbsp; </P>
 <P>The Job Cost EOM was enhanced to recognize the there might be a GL Income Account in the Cost Category and includes it in the computations. </P>
 <P>The Job Cost EOM Processing function supports a new methodology for recognizing revenue for fixed fee billing items using the reported percent complete data recorded in the Job Progress Viewer to determine over/under billings.&nbsp;See user note 2.32 fo details.  </P>
 <P><FONT style="font-weight:bold; " >GL Account from Vendor:</FONT> this enhancement effects customers that use Job Cost Categories with no GL expense account so the gl account will pull from the Vendor. Previously, this setup worked properly for AP entries but not Job Cost EOM - which did not pull a gl account from the Vendor. This functionality has now been changed so that the GL Account in the Vendor is also considered.</P>
 <P style="margin-left:36.00pt;">Note that Inventory is a special case where the Expense Acct might come from the Inventory Group depending on registry settings and other conditions.&nbsp; Otherwise, the normal progression for all cost types is (1) Cost Category; (2) Cost Code: (3) 'glcos' registry setting; (4) the Vendor record; (5) nothing.</P>
 <P>Prior to this release, the billing item's Fixed Fee flag was the only consideration.&nbsp; The new code also checks the job's Service Compute flag.&nbsp; All billing items attached to service compute jobs are now treated as T&amp;M, regardless of the Fixed Fee flag setting.</P>
 <P>Validation has been added to this function that will prevent Jobs with missing GL information from being posted. If you attempt to select or click the Go button if this situation exists, the system will display the error “Job (Job Id) has detail lines that are missing GL Accounts” and will not allow the post to proceed with the illegible lines flagged. </P>
 <P>&nbsp;<FONT style="font-weight:bold; " >Hint:</FONT> The sys-job-eom registry entry or the cost category should be examined if this message is displayed. </P>
 <H2>7.8 Job Template</H2>
 <P>Previously, if you selected a Client that was NOT a template from the Job Template viewer, a message erroneously told you to select a Client that was Not a Template. The message has been corrected. Also, if you double-click on the Client or Site fields, the lists will be filtered to display only Template Clients / Client Sites.  </P>
 <H2>7.9 Project Manager</H2>
 <P>If you click the sidebar button Create PO for a Job record and the system date (today) exceeds the Job’s Date Closed, the message ‘Cannot Create Job PO for closed Job’ will be displayed; the Purchase Order viewer will not be launched. &nbsp; </P>
 <P>In previous releases the list of Project Managers was controlled only by the Project Manager filter in the User record. The ranges now work correctly; you may filter on the Project Managers allowed by your User record. </P>
 <H2>7.10 Job Cost Code Viewer</H2>
 <P>In previous releases, the user was prevented from changing the Job Id if references to the Code Code were found in Job History. Unfortunately, this validation also prevented the user from being able to ‘clone’ cost codes or billing items by accessing a job cost code, and then changing the Job Id (to a job that did not have a corresponding cost code). This implementation has been changed so that, if the user does so, the viewer will change to ‘add’ mode to allow the new record to be created. </P>
 <H1>8. Inventory</H1>
 <H2>8.1  Inventory Group </H2>
 <P><FONT style="font-weight:bold; " >New Field – Default Cost Category:<BR></FONT>If this field is completed, the Cost Category will be set from the Inventory Item’s Inventory Group when entering items to the following records: </P>
 <P style="margin-left:36.00pt;">PO – Inventory Tab<BR>WO – Inventory Tab<BR>Inventory Adjustments Journal</P>
 <P>Note that care should be taken in using this feature if your firm has enabled the Operation Lockdown functionality specifying Direct/Indirect choice to Job Cost Categories. In this case, the Default Cost Category would only be set for Inventory Groups used with direct (non-overhead) Jobs.  </P>
 <H2>8.2 Inventory Item </H2>
 <P>Corrects Last Unit Cost calculation problem that occurred sporadically with new Inventory items.  </P>
 <P>This build corrects ‘syntax error – 131’ when the user clicked on the Serialized Tab of a serialized item. </P>
 <P>This build<FONT style="font-weight:bold; " > </FONT>corrects the setting of inventory last cost if a user deletes a PO line or changed the item id on the line. If the deleted/changed line had set the last cost, the last cost will now revert to its previous value. </P>
 <P>This build improves the display of the Due and On Hand quantities on the Purchases tab.</P>
 <H3>8.2.1 Price Code Handling – change to default behavior </H3>
 <P>This change impacts the Work Order, Quote, Client Order, and CSRAnywhere (Quote Management).</P>
 <P>The Inventory Item allows for 10 levels of Material Pricing, but Price Codes only allow for 5. In this situation, if a client normally had material price level 7, and Price Codes were in effect, the system would use markup pricing instead.</P>
 <P>In this release, with price codes in effect, and the default price level from the Client Site or Job is greater then 5, the system now defaults price level 1 from the Price Code. A registry entry (see user note 2.4.9) is available to always default Price Code Level 1. </P>
 <H3>8.2.2 Purchases Tab </H3>
 <P>The On Hand values did not display correctly if a receipt was made on the base purchase order, the purchase order was made a change order, and then the remainder was received. This problem has been corrected. </P>
 <H3>8.2.3 Serial Tab</H3>
 <P>This release corrects an 'openLabTestResults' Not Understood error when double-clicking on a line. The the Serial/Lot Master is now correctly displayed. </P>
 <P style="margin-top:0;margin-bottom:0">&nbsp;</P>
 <H2>8.3 Inventory Receipts Journal </H2>
 <P>The user is now required to specify an accounting period before changing any of the detail lines. </P>
 <P>This release fixes intermediate calculations of Job Cost Received in the inventory receipts journal to prevent incidents of the cost being truncated. </P>
 <P>Quick Attach now attaches to source PO as well as Inventory Receipt entry.  </P>
 <P>In a previous release, closing the PO from the AP Journal was made contingent on having all lines fully received and all committed costs relieved.  A problem may exist for General items received in the Inventory Received Journal – the cost was truncated, not rounded (e.g., .068 was truncated to .06 instead of being rounded to .070).  This problem has been corrected in the Inventory Receipts Journal so that the committed costs are now fully relieved (instead of being off by a penny(ies)) so that the AP Journal and Purchase Order viewer will allow the PO to be closed. If you have existing data where this problem exists, the Start Close Completed PO function may be used to individually close these PO’s as it uses a different method of determining eligibility for closure. </P>
 <P>The Inventory Receipts Journals and the history records it generates will now assume the security id of the Purchase Order used to create it. </P>
 <P>A new sort order has been added to the Inventory Receipts Journal List: Inventory Receipt by WorkorderId by Vendor Id. The Workorder Id in the PO header is used for this list.</P>
 <P>Two new ranges, Workorder Id: and Job Id: have been added to the Inventory Receipts Journal filter. The Workorder or Job Id in the PO header will be filtered on by this range. </P>
 <H2>8.4  REVISED REPORT: Report Price Book (RPRCEBK.rpt) </H2>
 <P>Due to inconsistancies when this report is run for Price Level 0, the Price Level now defaults to 1 when the Report Range is opened. This report (dated 2010-02-01 or later) must be imported into your database. </P>
 <H2>8.5 Inventory Physical Count</H2>
 <P>This release adds an enhancement added to handle commas inserted into the ‘blank’ line of .cvs file by Excel when importing a spreadsheet. </P>
 <H3>Implement Export/Import Mechanism Via Spreadsheets</H3>
 <P>This enhancement has been made to facilitate the ease of data collection for physical inventory counts by exporting a spreadsheet file with the suggested list of parts to count for the batch’s Location. This spreadsheet may then be updated using a spreadsheet program, and then imported into the Physical Count Viewer so that the adjustments may be computed. </P>
 <P>To implement this enhancement, two new buttons have been added to the Physical Count Viewer; ‘1b. Build Export Files’ and  and ‘2b. Import Entries.’ If these two buttons are used, the ‘1a. Load OnHand’ and ‘2a. Print Report’ buttons should NOT be used.</P>

 <P><FONT style="font-weight:bold; " >Pay Type Id:  OH Pay Type Id:</FONT><FONT style="font-weight:bold; " ><BR></FONT>When the user keys in a value into the Pay Type and OH Pay Type fields, the system now validates that the Job Use is set correctly. The system now provides an informative error message if the user attempts to enter a Pay Type with the wrong Job Use setting into one of these fields.  Previously, the message was ‘receiver is not a boolean’. This has been changed to ‘Pay type (pay type id) cannot be used with overhead jobs’ or ‘Pay type (pay type id) cannot be used with direct jobs’. </P>

 <P><FONT style="font-weight:bold; " >New Fields – Job Use:  All  Direct  Indirect<BR></FONT>The default value of All preserves the existing validation behavior which means there are no restrictions on the combinations.

 <H2>9.3 Tax Tables</H2>
 <P>The highest Tax Bracket field should always be formatted 99,999,99.99 for Compute Payroll to function properly.&nbsp;The software now includes a validation so that entering 99,999,999.nn results in the value being set to 99,999,999.99.&nbsp; This makes the bracket amount consistent with the Compute Payroll code's expectations.</P>
 <H2>9.4 Labor Journal </H2>
 <P>When using Other tab in the labor journal, the Description field on the individual lines is now written to payroll history when Compute Payroll is run. This enhancement was made for reporting purposes.</P>
 <P>To support defaulting for Operation Lockdown, the the column order on the Labor Journal has been changed,  moving the Labor Rate id to the right of the effective date so that a OH labor rate id can be selected before selecting a OH job. This will result in the Cost Category defaulting correctly. </P>
 <P style="margin-left:36.00pt;"><FONT style="font-weight:bold; " >IMPORTANT NOTE:</FONT> A revised version of the customization file will be needed to see this change.

 <P>Corrects problem where Equipment Id was not displayed on the Revenue tab if the Labor Journal entry they were imported from was edited. </P>
 <P>A warning has been added if entering time for an employee/period when Compute Payroll has already been run.</P>
 <H3>9.4.1 New Equipment Id Field on Detail Lines</H3>
 <P>The Equipment Id field now appears after the Work Order Id on all detail tabs. When the user enters a Work Order Id in any of these tabs, the new default behavior is for the Equipment on the first line of the Work Order’s Equipment tab to default in. If the user double clicks on the Equipment Id field, the system will display a produce a list of all equipment associated to the referenced Client Site in the work order. The registry option detailed in user note 2.4.8 may be used to disable this behavior so that the Equipment Id does NOT default in.</P>
 <P>This enhancement also includes logic that will cause the Job, Cost Code, Billing Item to default from the entered Equipment Id if the DefaultJobByEquipmentId=true registry value is set. In this case, the system only defaults job values if equipment id is entered or changed (For example, if I enter in a equipment id that defaults Job A and I manually override the job to Job B, no other changes to line should cause the job to revert back to Job A unless I change the Equipment Id.</P>
 <H2>9.5  PR Checks</H2>
 <P>This build corrects problems in earlier builds:</P>
 <P style="margin-left:36.00pt;">If 4 or more PTO Pay types are accrued, the first two are once again listed individually, and the remaining types are combined under the heading ‘various.’  </P>
 <P style="margin-left:36.00pt;">PTO Pay types that are NOT accrued will not appear on the PTO Summary.  Holiday hours (for example) were being incorrectly included in the PTO summary as negative hours. </P>
 <P>A validation has been added so that a PR Check won’t print if the hours for a Payroll Period changed after the Compute was run.</P>
 <H2>9.6 Payroll (Adjustment) Journal</H2>
 <P>Previously, if you created a PR Adjustment Journal entry and used the Tax tab, the Payroll Tax Type was not written to history. This version now writes the Tax Type to PR History for reporting purposes. </P>
 <H3>9.6.1 Earnings Tab</H3>
 <P>A new field, Type, has been added to the Earnings Tab. When completed by the user, the value will be posted to payroll history for reporting purposes.</P>

 <H2>9.10 Report W2 </H2>
 <P>This release supports several formatting changes in the W3 form printed for 2011 taxes. </P>
 <P>New support for boxes 7, 8, 9, 11</P>
 <P>Additional support for boxes 10, 12 and 14</P>
 <P>A new field, W-2 Category, has been added to the Deduction and the Earnings viewers. The purpose of this field is to enable the user to write to various W2 boxes by entering a 2-character box number (in the case of box 12,  followed by a code) in the appropriate W-Category box.  Note that only those boxes that can be controlled by an Earnings or Deduction entry to PR History (via normal processing Compute or PR Adjustment entries) are supported. This release increases the size of Box 12 Code Fields from 1 to 2 characters. </P>
 <P>&nbsp;Note: please consult the IRS website / your firm’s CPA before proceeding. </P>
 <P style="margin-left:36.00pt;">The system does NOT validate that a particular earning or deduction is configured correctly for particular box/code as far is IRS rules are concerned. The W2 functionality is implemented by querying PR History for entries when the Earning or Deduction record’s W-2 Category is completed, and then summing the entries for each particular category.  The user MUST ensure and test that the W-2 Category field is configured in such a way as to give the desired result. </P>

 <P>(RW2EF.rpt dated 4/28/2010 – versions 7.0 and up)</P>
 <P>This updated report provides generalized support for State and Local magnetic media reporting for all state and local authorities that accept the federal (IRS/SSA) file definitions.&nbsp;Note that special processing for CA, KS, KY and MN is also supported for this report. </P>
 <P><FONT style="font-weight:bold; " >New Field on the Report W2 Electronic File Range Screen: Local/Other Authority</FONT></P>

 <H2>9.14 Default Payroll Period Validation</H2>
 <P>In previous releases, an attempt was made to allow the user to maintain multiple default pay periods by security. On further consideration, this was decided that this is not a good idea. The validation has been changed so that only one payroll period can be saved as the default. </P>

 <H2>10.1 Work Order Viewer</H2>
 <P>If you click the sidebar button Create PO, and the system date (today) exceeds the Work Order header’s Job Date Closed, the message ‘Cannot Create Job PO for closed Job’ will be displayed; the Purchase Order viewer will not be launched. &nbsp; </P>
 <P>If you click the sidebar button Material Requisitioning, and the system date (today) exceeds the Work Order header Job Date Closed, the message ‘Cannot Run Material Requisitioning for closed Job’ will be displayed; and the Requisitioning wizard will not be launched. &nbsp; </P>
 <P>A new registry option, when implemented, will disable the posting of job history of budget cost and budget revenue for Preventive Maintenance work orders where the work order lines are marked QU. See user note 2.12.8 for details. </P>
 <P>If the sys-viewer-vwrkordr registry option  DefaultJobByEquipmentId is set to true, the system now only changes the job when the Equipment Id is changed. This corrects a problem where the manually changed Job on the work order line was defaulting back to the Equipment’s Job when quantity or hours were changed. </P>
 <P>This release corrects a “not understood” error if a user changed the fields impacting revenue (multiplier, unit cost, markup,  and amount revenue) in the Import Costs wizard.</P>
 <P>Improvements in writing to the database  (better manages writes after user errors). </P>
 <P>This version refines the WO Viewer's Import Costs / Import Cost Wizard functionality to better consolidate and eliminate reversed entries. This is particularly effective in importing Labor and Job Journal entries. </P>
 <P>If a Work Order has unbilled costs, the system now warns you if the WO Escalation Status is set to cancelled. </P>
 <P>This release corrects a sporadic problem that resulted in a mismatch between the WO Id in the header and that on the child tab. This problem occurred if the user accessed a work order from the dispatch board and then clicked the Other Info tab before it was completed loaded. </P>
 <P>Corrects recent problem if the registry option DefaultJobByEquipmentId is NOT implemented):</P>
 <P style="margin-left:36.00pt;">Import Costs: If you imported lines from JCH, the Job was being changed to the WO Header job, regardless of what was (for example) in AP. This has been corrected so that the Job in JCH is maintained.  If the registry entry to use the Equipment’s Job is enabled, the Job is set to the equipment's job on the import, regardless of the job specified in the AP entry.</P>
 <P style="margin-left:36.00pt;">Data Entry: If the Job on a Labor, Inventory or Other did not match the Work Order header Job, changing the actual / billable quantities resulted in the Job flipping back to the header job. This has been corrected so that the existing Job on the line is maintained.  </P>
 <P>The Use Tax Cost for Inventory and Material items is now being set on the Flat Rate import if the Job in the work order header has a Tax Status of Use. </P>
 <P>Performance enhancement for the display of the Work Order Escalation tab. </P>
 <P>This build corrects a sporadic data problem that might occur if: one of the list view Work Order panes was displayed (e.g., Invoices) AND a different record was then loaded into the viewer (e.g., double-clicking from the Dispatch Board). </P>
 <P style="margin-top:0.00pt;">This build includes an extension of the functionality <FONT style="color:blue; text-decoration:underline;" >http://fogbugz.sampro.net:3000/fogbugz/default.asp?pg=pgEditBug&amp;command=view&amp;ixBug=2129</FONT>that allowed imported extras to be billed on PM Work Orders if the PM Invoice Id in the Header and on the imported line matched AND the user flagged the Extra box on the work order. However, it was not possible for the user adjust the Revenue of the imported line unless the work order have first been saved with the WITH the Extra box checked.  In this release, it is no longer necessary to save the work order before adjusting the revenue. </P>
 <P>The Equipment Id has been moved to the left on the Labor, Inventory and Other tabs. </P>

 <P>If you buy a serialized item to a Work Order on a Purchase Order, receive the item, and then import it into the Work Order,  you will be prompted to enter its serial number on the Work Order’s Inventory tab. </P>
 <P>Validation has been added to ensure that an accounting period is specified for all Work Order Inventory lines that are not flagged as quotes. </P>
 <P>Requirement that Serialized Inventory items have a serial number entered is now skipped for Quoted lines.</P>
 <H3>10.1.3 Labor Tab</H3>
 <P><FONT style="font-weight:bold; " >Customizations with Start / End Times:</FONT></P>
 <P style="margin-left:36.00pt;">If user enters the Hours first, and then sets the Start End times (resulting in the Hours changing), the Revenue Amount is now updated correctly.</P>
 <P style="margin-left:36.00pt;">The Start/End times from the Labor Journal (if included in the customization) are now used to update the Work Order Labor tab when labor is imported to the Work Order via Import Costs. </P>
 <P>Due to popular demand,  the tab order has been changed so that the Description comes after the Effective Date – in previous versions of 7.2, it was after the flat rate field. If your upgrade to this version did not require a database conversion, you will require a new v.cus file to see this change. </P>
 <P>The release corrects a problem with<FONT style="font-weight:bold; " > </FONT>revenue calculations on the first line of this tab when the registry option (in sys-viewer-vwrkordr) defaultLineDateFromDateWorkCompleted=true is implemented. </P>

This button also changes all applicable lines within the Work Order viewer itself to a tax type of ' n/a'.</P>
 <P><FONT style="font-weight:bold; " >New Field - Billing Address Id:<BR></FONT>This field has been added to the Work Order's Invoicing tab.

 <P>The full contents of the Message field can be viewed by clicking the Magnify button. </P>
 <H3>10.1.8  Gross Margin Tab</H3>
 <P>Two discrepancies between the Gross Margin tab and the Revenues tab have been corrected:  </P>
 <P>Discrepancy 1 was with the Labor Total Cost field on the GM tab and the LaborCost column in the Totals line on the Revenues tab. The discrepancy occurred if there was labor burden on the labor line. The Revenues tab did not factor the labor burden into the LaborCost amount; it does now.</P>
 <P>Discrepancy 2  was with the Total Cost field on the GM tab and the TotalCost column in the Totals line on the Revenues tab.&nbsp; The discrepancy occurred for Other or Inventory lines which were created in the WorkOrder which contained a Use Tax amount.&nbsp; The Total Cost field on the GM tab did not factor in the Use Tax amount; it does now.</P>
 <H3>10.1.9 TechAnywhere Tab</H3>
 <P>A new tab, TechAnywhere, has been added to the work order viewer. This tab will only appear when RemoteTech is enabled in the vrgstry file. This tab displays a synopsis of messages posted to this work order from TechAnywhere. </P>
 <P>In previous releases, the blank Work Order record’s TechAnywhere tabs was filtered to NO Work Order Id instead of showing nothing (or 0's). This has been corrected. </P>
 <H3>10.1.10 COD Tab</H3>
 <P>In this version of the software, by default a COD posts a &quot;Cash Receipt&quot; as well as an AR Sales Entry. See user note 2.18.2 for a registry entry to restore default behavior). </P>
 <P>Note that In order to be able to use &quot;Reverse Invoice&quot; for invoices handled in this manner, the 'COD' Cash Receipt posting must first be reversed as follows: </P>
 <P>To find Cash Receipt for COD invoice... </P>
 <P style="margin-left:36.00pt;">Go to VIEW INVOICE MASTER - click on Child Tab:  'Trx History' &amp; note the TRXid # for the source 'AR Receipt' (fyi-COD parent tab will show the payment info).</P>
 <P>To remove the Cash Receipt, go to Cash Receipts... </P>
 <P style="margin-left:36.00pt;">1) Filter on TRXid # from step above</P>
 <P style="margin-left:36.00pt;">2) Change the Received Amount to 0</P>
 <P style="margin-left:36.00pt;">3) Delete off the lines</P>
 <P style="margin-left:36.00pt;">4) Save the entry</P>
 <P>You should now be able to reverse the invoice (providing it had not been 'deposited'. </P>
 <H3>10.1.11 Purchases and Quote Tabs</H3>
 <P>If multiple inventory receipt journal entries are made for the same PO, the WO Purchases tab now displays the Job Quantity and Quantity Vouchered correctly. </P>
 <P>In previous releases, the blank Work Order record’s Purchases and Quote tabs were filtered to NO Work Order Id instead of showing nothing (or 0's). This has been corrected. </P>
 <H3>10.1.12 Work Order Import Cost Wizard</H3>
 <P>In previous releases, if you accessed a different work order (e.g., from the Dispatch Board) while the import cost wizard was running, the costs could be imported into the wrong work order. The wizard now checks that the current work order is the correct one before completing the import. </P>
 <P>When processing Required Resource Inventory, the Import Cost Wizard now skips truck stock that has already been entered on the Work Order Inventory tab.</P>
 <H2>10.2 Dispatch Board</H2>
 <P>A display issue on the Dispatch Board's top toolbar has been corrected in this release. </P>
 <P>This releae corrects an error that occurred in the Classic Board if you clicked the cell one past the last column and that row had a valid WO in the last column, and when you click/double click to the right of the Time Chart. </P>
 <P>A Performance Monitor has been added to the SAM Pro Help menu. This may be used when you are advised to by your support representative. </P>
 <P>Corrects in problem in recent builds where, if the user attempted to access a WO when the WO list was already displayed, the WO highlighted on the list would be accessed, not the one selected on the Dispatch board. A similar problem accessing PO’s from the WO Purchases tab is also corrected.  </P>
 <P>If a Work Order has unbilled costs, the system now warns you if the Tech status to is set to cancelled. </P>
 <P><FONT style="font-weight:bold; " >Filter Tab:</FONT> <BR>You can now scroll all the way down the Filter tab instead of having to tab down. </P>
 <P>The following ‘open’ WO Status Category codes are now included when you select Uncompleted:&nbsp; rescheduled, parts ordered, tech declined. In addition, 'work declined'  is now included as a log type status when ‘Cancelled’ is selected.</P>
 <P>The Work Order’s Date Closed (on the Invoicing Tab) has been added as a range filter. </P>
 <P><FONT style="font-weight:bold; " >Time Chart, WO Daily Edit, and WO Entry Buttons</FONT>  <BR>Due to the increased number of buttons on the side button bar, users with a small monitor could not actually click the last button on the bar. The following buttons (that do not pertain to the selected work order) have been moved to the top button bar of the Dispatch Board: Time Chart, WO Daily Edit and WO Entry. </P>
 <P><FONT style="font-weight:bold; " >Email Button<BR></FONT>If you e-mail from the Dispatch Board and specify an Email Group, the contents of the Email Group is now expanded in the outgoing email. This behavior is consistent with the other SAM Pro emailing functionality. </P>
 <P><FONT style="font-weight:bold; " >Time and Distance Button</FONT> <BR>If SageQuest is not implemented, the message “this functionality not currently implemented on your system” will be displayed when this button is clicked. </P>
 <H3>10.2.1 Classic Dispatch Board - Hours Board</H3>
 <P>Prevents a ‘System Primitive’ error if the user attempts a drag-and-drop operation starting with a cell in the 'gray area' of undefined cells. </P>
 <P>In previous releases,  it was possible for Wheel mouse users to click in the Technicians column (which does not have a vertical scroll bar) and then scroll only that column up. This resulted in the work orders not being in the appropriate row for the technician. In this release, SAM Pro does not allow scrolling with the mouse wheel if no vertical scroll bar is found.  To scroll the Hours board, the right-hand section must now be selected.  </P>
 <H3>10.2.2  Power Board </H3>
 <P>The Client Site’s Shipping Street Address Line 2 has been added to the Dispatch Board. Note: the field will show up near the end of List. If you have customized your Dispatch Board columns, you must drag the field between to the desired location (e.g., between the first street address line and the city). If the column order of the Dispatch Board has not yet been customized, the new field will be positioned between the first street address line and the city.  </P>
 <H2>10.3 New Call</H2>
 <P>The Client Site’s WO Other tab may be used to generate standard trip or truck charges to Work Orders created in New Call. Previously, the Sales Tax Group and Type for the Work Order Other lines generated in this fashion were derived from the Sales Tax Group on the Client Site COP tab. In this release, the Sale Tax Group in the applicable Job record is used when generating these Work Order Other lines. </P>
 <P>The Customer PO (the Work Order’s PO# field) has been added as a column to the work order list. In addition, the columns have been rearranged as follows:</P>
 <P style="margin-left:36.00pt;">Work Order – Tech - Status - Work Code - Equipment - Date Scheduled - Date Closed</P>
 <P style="margin-left:36.00pt;">WO PO (customer’s PO) - Resolution Code - Work Requested</P>
 <P>This release corrects a display issue that occurred if a Site with a Service Manager was picked a second time; this Service Manager Id was selected correctly, but not redisplayed in the field. </P>
 <P>The Original WO field id is no longer blanked when a Work Code is selected. </P>
 <P>This release<FONT style="font-weight:bold; " > </FONT>corrects an auto-loading problem that occurred when selecting a Work Code Id after the Service Manager had been set by selecting the Client Site and then the Equipment Id.</P>
 <P>The system now updates the display of Client Id when the Default Service job is changed by selecting a different piece of equipment or changing the Job Id directly. </P>
 <P>The Refresh button has been removed from the New Call Screen’s top button bar.  The functionality of this button is not well defined for New Call, and has been the source of several problems. The New record button should be clicked to clear the fields. </P>
 <P>If the New Call viewer was left open for longer than a day, there was a problem in computing the scheduled date from the current system. Previously, the current system date used for these calculations was only set when New Call was first opened. The software has been enhanced so that the system date is refreshed under the following circumstances: </P>
 <P>1. Each time the user pushes the New Record button.<BR>2. After processing an Add Record operation.</P>
 <P><FONT style="font-weight:bold; " >New Call / New Call 2:  New Field: Client Id<BR></FONT>The Client Id and Name from the Default Service Job is now displayed to the right of the Job fields. The following logic will be used to derive the Default Service Job (and hence the Client):</P>
 <P style="margin-left:36.00pt;">When the Site is selected, look at the Equipment record with the lowest Rn for a Default Service Job; if one exists, display its Client. </P>
 <P style="margin-left:36.00pt;">When the Equipment is selected, check that Equipment’s Default Service Job and display its Client. </P>
 <P style="margin-left:36.00pt;">If the selected Equipment has no Default Service Job, display the Client from the Job that the user selects.  </P>
 <P><FONT style="font-weight:bold; " >New Call 2:</FONT> </P>
 <P>This build<FONT style="font-weight:bold; " > </FONT>corrects a “error 102 – incorrect syntax” if the Site Name (or other search fields) included a single quote.</P>
 <P>If you complete the Site Name in the New Call 2 screen, it now defaults to the New COD Site screen when you click the New COD Site button. In previous versions, the contents of this field were not being defaulted.</P>
 <P>Corrects problem where the New Call2 Find Site was not selecting the correct Site Display Lines when KeepFocusOnSitePane registry entry is set.</P>
 <H3>10.3.1 New Call 2 / COD Site</H3>
 <P>When a new COD Site is created, the Account Manager, Sales Rep, Service Manager and Dispatcher are now correctly set from the Site Template. </P>
 <P>When a COD work order is created using this function, the Account Manager, Service Manager, Dispatcher and Sales Rep now default from the Site if the corresponding fields in the selected Equipment are blank.</P>
 <P>Corrects problem in recent releases where the software erred if the Service Manager was set in the Client Site Equipment record associated with the Site template.  </P>
 <P>Corrects a problem where the Equipment the first WO created for a new COD site referenced the COD template, not the new site. Contact your service representative if existing data needs to be corrected. </P>
 <P>When New Call 2/ COD Site was first Implemented, all new COD Sites were created with their equipment pointing at a COD Template Job. In actual practice, it turns out that when a Template Job is referenced in a work order, changing it (e.g., for warranty work) generated template warning messages that interfere with work flow. For this reason, you may wish to create your COD Jobs be created as regular Jobs, not Templates. </P>
 <P>This build fixes template record error messages so that the true status of the record is listed. </P>
 <P>The Service Category is now cleared when switched from the New Call – New COD screen to regular New Call. </P>
 <P><FONT style="font-weight:bold; " >New Field: Dispatch Note<BR></FONT>When completed, this field will be written to the new Client Site’s Dispatch Note field. This optional field is designed to provide useful information (e.g., Guard Dog, Call Owner, etc.) to the Dispatcher/Technician. </P>
 <P>An updated v.cus file is required to see this enhancement. </P>

 <H2>10.5 Master Contract (PM Master Scheduler)</H2>
 <P>In the Setup / Renew tab, the Date and Contract fields were being blanked if you clicked the  next/previous record button. In this release, the system will always display the Main tab on the next/previous record.</P>

 <P>A new method of selecting Inspection days has been implemented that allows you to select specific dates of the month for your inspections. <BR><FONT style="font-weight:bold; " >New Fields:<BR>Wks:&nbsp; Mon:&nbsp; Tue:&nbsp; Wed:&nbsp; Thu:&nbsp; Fri:&nbsp; Sat:&nbsp; Sun:<BR>1<BR>2<BR>3<BR>4<BR>5</FONT></P>
 <P>This grid enables you to select the day (or days) of the month that the inspection should take place. This grid would typically only be used if inspections take place every month. </P>
 <P style="margin-left:36.00pt;">For example, specify an inspection for the 1st and 3rd Monday of each month, the grid would be completed as follows:<BR>Wks:&nbsp; Mon:&nbsp; Tue:&nbsp; Wed:&nbsp; Thu:&nbsp; Fri:&nbsp; Sat:&nbsp; Sun:<BR>1&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;X<BR>2<BR>3&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;X<BR>4<BR>5</P>
 <P>When the Autofill button is clicked, the system will calculate the correct date of each 1st and 3rd Monday, and use that information to add these inspections to the Schedule tab. </P>
 <P>The new day of the month functionality may be used with the monthly inspection functionality. </P>
 <P style="margin-left:36.00pt;">If the Inspect?  Month fields are all blank, but one or more Day fields are checked, inspections will be checked for all months (as defined in the Days section) will be created when the Auto Populate button is clicked. </P>
 <P style="margin-left:36.00pt;">If only certain Inspect? Month fields are checked, and one or more Days are checked, only those Days in the selected months will be added to the Schedule when the Auto Populate button is clicked. </P>
 <P style="margin-left:36.00pt;">Note: if Days were selected, and Inspect? Months were all blank, all of the Inspect? Months will be checked when the Master Contract record is saved.</P>
 <P><FONT style="font-weight:bold; " >Inspection Defaults: Est Hours&nbsp; -&nbsp; Work Code – Escalation Profile<BR></FONT>These fields enable you to select the default values that will be used to populate the Schedule tab when you click the Auto Populate button; this it true for both Monthly and Day of the Week inspections. These fields override the registry setting sys-viewer-vmstrcntrct options (if they exist) used to set the work code. If these fields are not completed, those specified in the registry will be used.</P>
 <H3>10.5.2 Intervals Functionality – Setup/Renew Tab</H3>
 <P>SAMPRO currently supports two basic methodologies for defining the scheduling rules to follow when auto-populating: monthly (implemented by flagging the desired Inspection months) and by day of the week (e.g, the first and third Tuesday of the month). &nbsp; </P>
 <P>This modification introduces a third option which allows the user to specify a start date and the number of days (interval) until the following inspection.&nbsp; This option is implemented as follows. </P>
 <P style="margin-left:36.00pt;">1. Complete the fields (Job, Start and End Date, Contract Amount, etc.) not pertaining to pm scheduling. You must flag at least one Bill Date. Do NOT flag any of the Monthly or Day of the Month inspection boxes. </P>
 <P style="margin-left:36.00pt;">2. Click the Auto Populate button. If none of the Inspection boxes are flagged, the system will open a Prompt window that requests the First Inspection Date and the Interval(Days).&nbsp; </P>
 <P style="margin-left:72.00pt;"><FONT style="font-weight:bold; " >First Inspection Date:</FONT><BR>The system uses the Contract Start Date the default date for the First Inspection, but this may be adjusted by the user (note that the date must fall between the Contract Start and End Dates).</P>
 <P style="margin-left:72.00pt;"><FONT style="font-weight:bold; " >Interval (Days):<BR></FONT>This field defaults to zero, but must be set to greater than zero and less than 29.  For example, if your first inspection date is 1/3/2010 and your Interval is set to 10 days, inspections will be scheduled on the 1/3/2010, 1/13/2010, 1/23/2010 and so on. </P>
 <P style="margin-left:36.00pt;">3. Click OK. The auto-populate logic will create Inspection lines starting with the First Inspection Date and then every Interval(Days) afterwards throughout the duration of the contract.</P>
 <H3>10.5.3  Time of Service Billings – Main Tab</H3>
 <P><FONT style="font-weight:bold; " >New Field: Time Of Service Bill?</FONT><BR>This new field enables the user to generate Time of Service PM Work orders, where the Contract Value on the Site List will be evenly divided between all scheduled PM Work Orders. If multiple sites are included for this Master Contract, a separate work order (each with the appropriate Contract Value) will be generated for Site per Inspection. If multiple equipment is included in the contract, the Contract Value will be evenly divided on the Other lines, each referencing a piece of equipment. </P>
 <P>If this box is flagged:</P>
 <P style="margin-left:36.00pt;">The Job used for PM Work Orders should be flagged as Service Compute.</P>
 <P style="margin-left:36.00pt;">The system will not allow the Amortize Revenue box to be set.</P>
 <P>Note that when Start Create PM Work Order is run, the Contract Value will be written to the PM Work Order; it will not appear on the Client Site Equipment PM Schedule lines. </P>
 <H3>10.5.4 Main Tab and Filter Ranges</H3>
 <P><FONT style="font-weight:bold; " >New Field: Cancelled Date</FONT><BR>This date is used in conjunction with Create PM Billings and WO’s to prevent their generation <FONT style="text-decoration:underline;" >past the Cancelled date</FONT>.  Note that the Start Renew Master Contract function will ignore Master Contracts whose Cancelled Date is set. This field has also been added to the range screen so that Cancelled Master contracts will not appear on the active list of Master Contracts.</P>
 <P><FONT style="font-weight:bold; " >New Field: Cancelled Reason<BR></FONT>This field may be used to briefly describe why this contract was cancelled. </P>
 <H2>10.6 Start Create PM Workorders</H2>
 <P>This release corrects a problem where the system was creating a purchase order to a blank Vendor if the PM was assigned to a Technician that was flagged as a Subcontractor but with the Vendor Id (on the Technician  record’s Main tab) blank.  A PO is now generated for subcontractor Technicians only if the Vendor Id is completed. </P>
 <P>This release corrects a problem where the StatusForPreventiveMaint= option in the sys-web-access registry was being ignored by Create PM Work Orders.  </P>
 <P>The system now applies the AutoFillReceived registry setting (from sys-viewer-vprchseordrlst)  when making Subcontractor POs (e.g., when PO’s are created for a subcontractor in Create PM Work Orders). Note that even if autofill is enabled by registry, checking the Vendor field Disable PO Autofill prevents the autofill.</P>
 <P><FONT style="font-weight:bold; " >New Filter Range: Agreement Type Id:<BR></FONT>This new range enables the user run this function for only those Master Contracts with the selected Agreement types. </P>
 <P>If the Work Code Id is different on two lines of the Client Site Equipment PM Schedule for the same day, the system now forces a separate work order to be created.</P>
 <P>Corrects a problem in correctly generating work orders where  the Master Contract has multiple lines for each inspection date (each references a different work code) and the Create function is run for a specify work code. </P>
 <P><FONT style="font-weight:bold; " >Master Contract / Create PM Billing</FONT><FONT style="font-weight:bold; " > - </FONT><FONT style="font-weight:bold; " >Change to Default Behavior: </FONT> when Create PM Workorders closes (by X’ing or clicking Go) the system now deletes Client Site Equipment PM Schedule line that were NOT processed as work orders.  Previously, all lines remained on the Site Equipment PM Schedule even if the checklist was closed  without hitting Go, or the Do box was not flagged when ‘go’ was clicked.  </P>
 <H3>10.6.0 PM Work Orders / Requisitioning – CHANGES TO DEFAULT BEHAVIOR</H3>
 <H3>Set the Cost Category for Required Resources: </H3>
 <P>In addition to these options, Required Resource processing must be enabled via a customization file or a registry setting (in sys-ffv-global-settings).</P>

 <P>In the first option, specify a Cost Category Id to be used with the Inventory Items on the PM Parts list.</P>
 <P>In the second option, specify a Cost Category Id to be used with the Other Items on the PM Parts list. </P>
 <P>Also, if PM WO’s are being generated that HAVE required resources, the work order status will be Waiting Parts. This will override any entries made in the sys-web-access registry entries. </P>
 <H3>Do Not Write Required Resources to PM Work Orders </H3>
 <P>If your firm uses required resources, the following new registry may be used to prevent the writing of PM parts to the Required Resources tab for non-subcontractor technician (Required Resource lines are <FONT style="font-weight:bold; text-decoration:underline;" >never</FONT> written if the PM is created for a subcontractor technician):</P>
 <P>Id: sys-start-scrtepmwo</P>
 <P>Setting Key: DisableReqPMParts&nbsp; Setting Value: true  (default is false)</P>
 <P>This registry entry only controls the writing of flagged service parts to the Required Resources tab. The TechServiceParts option is used to determine whether flagged parts will <FONT style="font-weight:bold; text-decoration:underline;" >also</FONT> be written to </P>
 <P style="margin-left:36.00pt;">The Inventory,/Other tabs as quoted lines (TechServiceParts=Yes or if the option is absent)</P>
 <P style="margin-left:36.00pt;">The Work Order Equipment Work Requested (TechServiceParts=Sub)</P>
 <P style="margin-left:36.00pt;">No additional lines written (TechServiceParts=No)</P>
 <P>The above options control the behavior of flagged service parts if the technician is not a subcontractor or if a technician is not assigned. Flagged service parts are always written to the Work Order Equipment Work Requested for subcontractor techs. </P>
 <P style="margin-left:36.00pt;">&nbsp;</P>
 <H3>10.6.1 Create PM WO Checklist </H3>
 <P><FONT style="font-weight:bold; " >New Field: Already Done<BR></FONT>This enhancement is designed to allow the user to identify maintence that has already been completed and therefore does not need a new maintenance work order. &nbsp;A new field, 'Already Done?' has been adde to the check list.  It is in the last column on the right-hand side of the list. </P>
 <P>When this option is checked for a given line that is also checked as ‘Do’, a Work Order will not be generated. The Client Site Equipment PM Schedule will display the message ‘NO WO’ in the PM Workorder Id field.  &nbsp;</P>
 <P style="margin-left:36.00pt;">&nbsp;</P>
 <H2>10.7 Start Create PM Billings</H2>
 <P>The Range is now closed when the Checklist is opened to ensure that entries are made correctly.  </P>
 <P><FONT style="font-weight:bold; " >New Filter Range: Agreement Type Id:<BR></FONT>This new range enables the user run this function for only those Master Contracts with the selected Agreement types. </P>
 <P>This enhancement addresses the case when BranchOverrideFrom=job AND BranchSequence= nextinvce,nextwo are both implemented.&nbsp; The Invoice Master records and the PM Invoice Work Orders are now both prepended the job's branch when Start Create PM Billings is run.</P>
 <P>Corrects a system primitive error when RININV4 is used for PM Invoicing. </P>
 <H3>10.7.1 Master Contracts /  Create PM Billing: </H3>
 <P><FONT style="font-weight:bold; " >Change to Default Behavior: </FONT> </P>
 <P>When the Create PM Billing checklist closes (either by Xing or clicking Go) the system now deletes non-posted non-invoiced  Client Site PM Billing lines referencing a master Contract billing schedule records. In previous versions, all lines remained on the Site PM Billing schedule even if the checklist was closed  without hitting Go, or the Do box was not flagged when ‘go’ was clicked.  This means that the ‘three step process’ for billing is now longer operational for PM Billing.</P>
 <P>Previously, even though a client site billing line had been created from Master Contract, but not posted or invoiced&nbsp; error message 'No Fields may be Changed on this Inspection Line if Equipment PM Line Exists' was displayed when the user attempted to adjust it. This has been corrected. </P>
 <P>In the Master Contract viewer, the AutoPopulate  was not clearing the field clntstebllngschdle-rn when new bill lines were generated; this caused you not to be able to change amounts on the billing lines. This has been corrected. </P>
 <H2>10.8  TechFinder</H2>
 <P>This release<FONT style="font-weight:bold; " > c</FONT>orrects an error that occurred if you flag the Restrict to Techs Already Scheduled in Work Zones box.</P>
 <P>A registry entry is now available to change the Hours display in the TechFinder viewer (see user note 2.4.6 )</P>
 <P>By default, the TechFinder displays the number of estimated hours assigned to a tech by day. A alternate view is available registry that displays the  following:</P>
 <P style="margin-left:36.00pt;">W=n Z=n</P>
 <P style="margin-left:36.00pt;">where W means Work Order and n is the number of work orders for that day and Z means Zone and n is the number of work orders scheduled that day that match the search zone specified. The background colors of Green, Yellow and Red are retained to indicate estimated hour load. </P>
 <H2>10.9 WO Schedule Report</H2>
 <P>This new report provides a five-day summary of the assigned work orders displayed on a specific Dispatch Board. Only WO’s that are assigned to a technician are listed (unassigned work orders are not listed).  The following report must be imported and made available to applicable users: RSCHDLERPT.rpt.</P>
 <H3>Report Input Fields:</H3>
 <P><FONT style="font-weight:bold; " >Begin Date:<BR></FONT>Dispatches for this date plus the next five days will be included on the report; this field is optional.</P>
 <P><FONT style="font-weight:bold; " >Board Id:<BR></FONT>Specify the Dispatch Board to be listed in the report; this field is required. </P>
 <P><FONT style="font-weight:bold; " >WO Type:<BR></FONT>This optional range may be used to filter on certain types of work orders. For example, to display only Service type work orders, you would enter Service in this range.</P>
 <P><FONT style="font-weight:bold; " >Report Format:</FONT></P>
 <P>This report is laid out in a similar fashion to the Day version of the Classic Dispatch Board: Technicians are listed along the left side, and days along the top. </P>
 <P>For each dispatch line, the following information is printed: Site Id: WO Id: WO Name.</P>
 <H2>10.10 SageQuest Interface</H2>
 <H3>Purpose:</H3>
 <P>Data-Basics now supports a two-way interface between SageQuest’s Mobile Control and SAM Pro to provide to provide tools for SAM Pro Dispatchers and TechAnywhere users.</P>
 <H3>Usage:</H3>
 <P>When Work Orders were uploaded to SageQuest, they were previously sent using an hours format like “estimatedHours=2.5”. At SageQuest’s request, we now convert estimated hours from hours to seconds before we send it up to them.</P>
 <P>Internal changes to increase performance have been implemented in this release.</P>
 <P>A SageQuest mobile device will be installed in the Technician’s truck, providing real-time GPS mapping and tracking facilities.  When enabled, SAM Pro is able to pass work order information to SageQuest. This information in turn provides SAM Pro user with tools for the people taking service calls and (e.g., distance and directions from a Tech’s current location to that of a new service call). Similar tools are also available to TechAnywhere users. </P>
 <P>Work Orders  for configured drivers that are scheduled for today will be pushed to SageQuest. </P>

 <P style="margin-left:36.00pt;">Sometimes users create &quot;fictitious&quot; techs to use as place holders for unassigned work orders. For example, users put a tech called PM on their D-Boards and park the PM Work Orders there for later assignment. Since the tech &quot;PM&quot; isn't a valid SageQuest driver the work order wouldn't show on the SageQuest map. This registry setting will cause any tech listed to be handled just like the work order had no tech assigned to it. Since SageQuest displays unassigned work orders, these work orders would show up with a blank tech id.</P>
 <P style="margin-left:36.00pt;">This registry option will allow a user to specify a list of tech id's that SageQuest will treat the same as it treats un-assigned work orders.</P>

 <H3>10.10.1 SageQuest – Garmin Support</H3>
 <P>SageQuest has added functionality on their system which allows interaction with a Garmin GPS device installed into the customer’s vehicles.  </P>
 <P>Accordingly, two new functions have been added to the SQServer application:</P>
 <P style="margin-left:36.00pt;">CreateStopForWorkorder(workorderId) – This function identifies the driver from the workorder, the vehicle from the driver, creates a ‘Stop’ based on workorder’s contents, and sends the Stop to the vehicle’s Garmin. Actually, all these steps are performed at SageQuest. SQServer just forwards the workorder Id to them. </P>
 <P style="margin-left:36.00pt;">Getstopsforvehicle(clientVehicleId) – This function answers a list of Stops currently assigned to the indicated vehicle. </P>
 <P>Under certain circumstances, Sampro will need to call CreateStopForWorkorder() to upload the stop to the workorder’s vehicle. This is implemented when the following registry option is enabled. </P>
 <P>The following registry setting is needed to implement GPS Stops</P>

 <H2>10.10 Scheduled Event Manager </H2>
 <P>This release corrects problems handling read-only documents. </P>
 <H2>10.11 Start Work Order Entry </H2>
 <P>Validation now requires that only an active payroll period may be selected. </P>
 <H2>10.12 Service Worksheets</H2>
 <P>Corrects problem with Autosaving worksheets.  </P>
 <H2>10.13 Start Archive Work Orders</H2>
 <H3>Purpose:</H3>
 <P>This function is designed to allow high-volume customers to set older Work Orders to an Archived status. To be eligible for archiving, the Work Order’s Date Closed must be set, and the Escalation Status would typically be set to Billed or Cancelled. </P>
 <P>When Work Order is Archived, a Tech line will be added set to the Log Type of Archive which will override all other statuses when setting the Escalation Status and Status Category. To ‘unarchive’ a Work Order, the user can simply delete or change the ‘archived’ Tech line and save the Work Order. </P>
 <P>Archived Work Orders will not appear on the Dispatch Board, but are still listed in the New Call WO pane. </P>
 <P>A new button, Archived, has been added to the Work Order List; clicking this button filters the list to Archived Work Orders only. </P>
 <H3>Usage:</H3>
 <P>This function may be run by the user to archive selected work orders. </P>
 <P style="margin-left:36.00pt;">Warning: use with caution if many work orders are being archived (e.g, the first time the function is run) – it is a CPU intensive function.  </P>

 <H2>10.14 Start Autoarchive Workorders</H2>
 <H3>Purpose:</H3>
 <P>The function Start Autoarchive Work Orders is designed to allow high-volume customers to set older Work Orders to an Archived status. </P>
 <H3>Usage:</H3>
 <P>This function is designed to be run as a scheduled event. The following registry options must be in effect.  Contact your support representative for assistance in setting this up. </P>
 <H3>Registry setting parameters:</H3>
 <P><FONT style="font-weight:bold; " >Id: sys-start-Sautoarchivewo</FONT></P>
 <P><FONT style="font-weight:bold; " >Setting Key:</FONT> DaysOld&nbsp;<FONT style="font-weight:bold; " >Setting Value</FONT><FONT style="font-weight:bold; font-style:italic; " >:</FONT><FONT style="font-style:italic; " > #days</FONT></P>
 <P>If this was set to 180 days, the work order would have to have a date closed on it 180 days or earlier than today. </P>
 <P><FONT style="font-weight:bold; " >Setting Key:</FONT> EscalationStatuses  <FONT style="font-weight:bold; " >Setting Value:</FONT> billed,cancelled</P>
 <P>This is the recommended setting. Archiving ‘completed’ work orders with this function is NOT recommended as they may have unbilled costs.</P>

 <H1>11. Quote Master</H1>
 <H2>11.1 Quote Viewer</H2>
 <P>The registry option SetSourceWOStatusOnApproval was inadvertently omitted in recent releases. This functionality has been restored. </P>
 <P>Corrects problem introduced in build 098 where Tax Status did not default correctly from the Source WO. </P>
 <P>If Outlook is enabled in the sys-email registry, Quotemaster will now warn you that “You can not send PO Emails when using Outlook” if you click the Vendor Approval button. Previously, a system error appeared.  </P>
 <P>The ApprovalWizardDefaultTechStatus registry option supports the AutoUpdateWOTechStatusIgnore option, regardless of whether the list of statuses to ignore is uppercase or lowercase. </P>
 <P>If a WO fails to be generated, the software now display a message box and writes the errors as .txt files. The .txt files are  written to the directory defined by the dbreportfiles registry id.</P>
 <P>An option to display estimated tax has been added to the Quote Form (RQTEFRM) and Quote Recap (RQTERCP) reports. Note that this enhancement only is supported if the Sales Tax Group has the Group Tax Rate completed; a sales tax estimate for graduated sales tax rates is not supported. These reports must be dated 3/2/2010 or later.</P>
 <P>When a Work Orders or Purchase Order is updated by Quote Master, the PO or WO’s Change Log is now appropriately updated.</P>
 <P>This release re-enables the insert line with copy functionality in the Quote viewer. A Warning is displayed if trying to insert with copy on lines pointing to an option that does not have a status of open. Note that the insert functionality is not available for scope options.</P>
 <P>If a user added a new Scope line with a Revenue Adjustment Id, and then approved the Quote without pushing the Revenue Adjust button or saving it first, the Revenue Adjustment was not written to the Quote or Work Order.  Now, the user is asked whether or not to enter the Revenue Adjustment. This build also corrects a rounding error on management fee calculations, and prevents approved revenue adjustment lines from being deleted.  </P>
 <P>Jobs with Tax Status of ‘Unknown’ are now excluded from selection as lead work orders, and in the Quote Master Wizard. </P>
 <P>Whatever tax type is listed on the Quote lines will now be written to the Purchase Order detail.</P>
 <P><FONT style="font-weight:bold; " >Sales Tax Group</FONT><FONT style="font-weight:bold; " >:</FONT> <BR>In previous releases, the tax group in Quotemaster defaulted from the Client Site COP tab, regardless of whether a different one was specified in the lead work order's job.&nbsp;In this release, the defaulting works as follows:</P>
 <P style="margin-left:36.00pt;">If there is a lead work order, the Sales Tax Group from the wo's job defaults in </P>
 <P style="margin-left:36.00pt;">If there is NO lead work order, or the Sales Tax Group in the lead wo's job was blank, Sales Tax Group defaults from the Client Site's COP tab.</P>

 <P>The system now prevents the user from selecting an Archived Work Order as the source Work Order.  </P>
 <P><FONT style="font-weight:bold; " >Revenue</FONT><FONT style="font-weight:bold; " > Adjust Button</FONT><FONT style="font-weight:bold; " >:</FONT> When you click the Revenue Adjust button,  the Sales Tax Type on the Revenue Adjust Tab is now being set to 'sales' when it should be (e.g., Tax Group has a group rate, and the applicable category is taxable).&nbsp;</P>
 <H3>Saving Quote Before Approval Wizard is Run - Change to Default Behavior</H3>
 <P>This purpose of this change is to ensure that the Quote is always saved before the Approval Wizard is run. </P>
 <P style="margin-left:36.00pt;"><FONT style="font-weight:bold; " >New Button: Approval Wizard</FONT></P>
 <P style="margin-left:36.00pt;">Unless the following registry entry is enabled, the user will set one or more scopes to ‘Approved’, save the Quote, and then click the Approval Wizard button to run the wizard. Note that the system will warn you to save the quote if it determines that unsaved changes have been made prior to clicking the button. </P>

 <H3>11.1.1  Scope tab</H3>
 <P>When entering a flat rate to a quote scope line, the scope of services in the quote scope line now always defaults from the corresponding field in the flat range category. </P>
 <P>The system no longer<FONT style="font-weight:bold; " > </FONT>defaults in the Equipment Id if multiple Equipment lines exist on the WO. The Equipment Id will only default if a single piece of Equipment appears on the source Work Order. </P>
 <P>The validation of option code is now case insensitive: this means that you cannot create options AA, aa, aA and Aa – they are all considered duplicates.</P>
 <P><FONT style="font-weight:bold; " >New </FONT><FONT style="font-weight:bold; " >Quote Scope Status:</FONT><FONT style="font-weight:bold; " > Printed</FONT></P>
 <P>This enhancement enables the user to start controlling changes to &quot;printed&quot; quotes.  The reason for this is to reduce the chance that the quote the customer reviewed (as a printed quote or via CRMAnywhere Acceptance) is changed without the customer seeing and approving the changes.  To implement this enhancement, a version of the Quote Form with the printed functionality enabled must be installed in your database. </P>
 <P>A new status, Printed has been added. The user is not allow to directly select this setting. Instead, the system will now ask &quot;Did the quote print successfully?&quot; IF the version of the RQTEFRM that supports this functionality is installed. If  the user answers ‘Yes’,  the status for the Open options will be set to &quot;Printed&quot;.</P>
 <P>The system will disallow changes to any scope lines if the status is set Printed, Accepted, Approved or Declined (the user must change status to open to make changes).  Changes to Labor, Inventory, Material, Other and Subcontractor lines will only be allowed if the associated Scope Option is set to Open.</P>

 <P style="margin-left:36.00pt;">The Quote form has been revised to support the printed process from SAM Pro (see user note 11.1). Printing a quote from CRMAnywhere will not set the option status to Printed.   An option to display estimated tax has been added to the Quote Form  This enhancement only is supported if the Sales Tax Group has the Group Tax Rate completed; a sales tax estimate for graduated sales tax rates is not supported. </P>

 <H3>11.1.2 Inventory and Material Tabs</H3>
 <P>The Inventory Item Id is now a required field on the Inventory Tab.</P>
 <P>On the Inventory Tab, the Vendor Part number now correctly writes to the corresponding field in the PO that is created when the approval wizard is run. The Vendor Part Number on the PO also updates the Inventory Item’s Vendor tab.</P>
 <P>Quote Master now uses the same rules as the Work Order for the inclusion of the tax cost for Inventory and Materials to allow for proper markup and GM% calculation. Previously, the Quote viewer did not build up the cost and revenue with any associated tax cost (e.g, from use tax). This change impacts lines lines entered directly on the Quote, as well as from Flat Rates. </P>
 <H3>11.1.3 Notes Tab and List View</H3>
 <P>The rules for setting the Mixed Status and Inactive Status Category were sometimes incorrectly set. This could result in a quote incorrectly appear on the closed rather than the active list.  The new rules for setting the status based on the scope lines are as follows:</P>
 <P>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Status&nbsp;&nbsp;Category</P>
 <P style="margin-left:72.00pt;">No Scope Lines or All Open Lines  &nbsp;&nbsp;open&nbsp;&nbsp;active<BR>All Accept lines&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;accept&nbsp;&nbsp;active<BR>All Decline lines&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;decline&nbsp;&nbsp;inactive<BR>All Printed Lines&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;printed&nbsp;&nbsp;active<BR>All Approved Lines (with no dates set)&nbsp;&nbsp;approved&nbsp;&nbsp;active<BR>All Approved Lines (with all dates set) &nbsp;&nbsp;approved&nbsp;&nbsp;inactive<BR>All Approved Lines (with some dates set)&nbsp;mixed&nbsp;&nbsp;active</P>
 <P style="margin-left:72.00pt;">After the above checks the Status must be       &nbsp;mixed<BR>Some open or Accepted or printed     &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;active<BR>Some Approved (with all dates set)&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;inactive<BR>Some Approved (with no dates set)               &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;active<BR>Some Approved (with some dates set)               &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;active</P>
 <H3>11.1.4 Revenue Adjustments Tab</H3>
 <P>Improved handling of Yes/No answers to “Revenue Changes Detected: do you want to adjust the revenue” prompt. Now, if you answer Yes, the system will update the Revenue Adjustment tab for you. If you answer No, the Revenue Adjustment tab will not be revised by the system. </P>
 <P>When the Revenue Adjustment Id is changed on a Scope and it detects there are already revenue adjustment lines, the user is warned to remove the Revenue Adjustment Lines before trying to change the Revenue Adjustment Id. </P>
 <P>On fixed price scopes,  and using a Revenue Adjustment  with the Totals field set, the TaxType Id is now set to ‘ n/a’.  Previously, it was not set at all.  </P>
 <H2>11.2 Quote Master Approval Wizard</H2>
 <P>Previously, if an Accounting Period was not flagged as Default, the posting of PO's from the Quotemaster Wizard failed. The following enhancement (when generated PO’s):  </P>
 <P style="margin-left:36.00pt;">1. Uses the default Accounting Period (if it exists),<BR>2. If no default exists, it uses the 'first' active accounting period with today's date in the date range.&nbsp;<BR>3. If both of the above fail, the Wizard warns the user, and the PO post fails as in previous releases. </P>
 <P>If you cleared the flag from an Option Code in the QM Wizard, details pertaining to the unflagged options persisted in some of the following screens. This has been corrected. </P>
 <P>This release corrects a problem that occurred if the user immediately logged out of SAM Pro after the Approval Wizard was run: a new Work Order was created, and nothing else (no PO, no update to the Quote).&nbsp;  </P>
 <P>New Work Orders generated by Quote Master will have their Description field set to 'Quote: #####'.</P>
 <P>If a quote was set up to generate multiple PO's; only the last one (on the QM Wizard PO screen) was actually created if the user made no changes when the wizard was running. This has been corrected.</P>
 <P>In this release, 'waitcustapprvl' from has been removed from the default 'AutoUpdateWOTechStatusIgnore' list so that their status can be appropriately updated. </P>
 <P style="margin-top:0;margin-bottom:0"> If a WO fails to be generated, the software now displays a message box and write the errors as .txt files. The .txt files should be written to the directory defined by the dbreportfiles registry id.&nbsp;</P>
 <P>The purchase order’s PO extra flag is now set for non-fixed fee quotes. </P>
 <P>If a PO fails to be generated, the software now displays a message box and writes the errors as .txt files. The .txt files are written to the directory defined by the dbreportfiles registry id.</P>
 <P>The Escalation Profile Id field has been added to the first screen of the QuoteMaster wizard. It will be used by the system if a NEW work order is being generated by Quote Master (Export to New WO is selected). This field will not change the existing source work order. This field defaults from the source work order (if referenced in the Quote header) or from the equipment record associated to the first approved scope.</P>
 <H3>11.2.1 Shipping Location</H3>
 <P>Warning Message:</P>
 <P>If the user changes the default Shipping Location on the last Wizard screen, the system always uses the Shipping Location selected on the first line. The follwing message will now be displayed if you select a different location for subsequent PO lines: “Warning: you have changed the default Shipping Location for one or more PO's. The Shipping Location for each PO will be set to the Shipping Location selected on the first line. Split shipments must be handled manually.”</P>
 <P style="margin-top:0;margin-bottom:0">&nbsp;</P>
 <H1>12. Manufacturing</H1>
 <H2>12.1 Client Order viewer</H2>
 <P>The GL Entity for lines designated as Drop Ship PO is now transferred to the PO that is generated. </P>
 <P>Edits to the Deposit Tab now result in the correct reversals to the original GL Entries. </P>
 <H3>Freight Charges  – CHANGE TO EXISTING BEHAVIOR </H3>
 <P>In previous versions, the code that prepares the COP Invoice looked to the APJ-GEN tab for the Freight Charge associated to a drop-ship order.&nbsp; Everything from the GEN tab was treated as freight.&nbsp; However, some customers may have a situation where they wish to record Sales Tax on the GEN tab which caused it to appear as freight on the COP invoice. </P>
 <P>The COP record has a setting for freight charges.&nbsp; It has three choices:</P>
 <P>1. Prepaid = pay the freight company, do not bill the customer.<BR>2. Collect = freight company collects freight charge during delivery.<BR>3. Prepay&amp;Add = pay the freight company and bill the customer.<BR><BR>In this build, the existing code has been adjusted so that the APJ-GEN tab is included as freight on the COP Invoice <FONT style="text-decoration:underline;" >when the freight choice is Prepay&amp;Add</FONT>.</P>
 <H2>12.2 Recurring Client Order</H2>
 <P>Validation has been added to the Recurring Client Order viewer such that, when selecting a Site, that the Client Site's Client Id field (on the COP tab) is completed.</P>
 <P><FONT style="font-weight:bold; " >Release Recurring Client Orders:</FONT> this function now posts to Inventory History using the Client Id and Name from the Client on the Site’s COP tab in the same fashion as a manually created Client Order. See your support rep for help with updating your existing data.  </P>
 <H3>12.3 Shop Order Transfer Ticket</H3>
 <P>Entering a non-zero value in the Qty Transferred field now forces the Transfer Done field to True: this field must be flagged for correct processing.</P>
 <P><FONT style="font-weight:bold; " >Full Orders Only</FONT><BR>If this field is checked, only Shop Order Transfer Tickets for Full Orders will be printed. The definition of a Full Order is: </P>
 <P>1. All BOM items are released to pick<BR>2. No BOM items are on backorder for the shop order</P>
 <P><FONT style="font-weight:bold; " >Work Order Id:<BR>Work Order Type:<BR></FONT>These range fields have been added to enable the user to filter Shop Order Transfer tickets to those generated by Material Requisitioning. For example, to print tickets for only those Shop Orders generated by Service Work Orders, you would enter the word Service in the Work Order Type range. To limit the tickets to those generated by PM Work Orders, enter P% in the Work Order Type Range. </P>
 <P>The Work Order Id range can be used to generate the Shop Order Transfer Tickets for a specific Work Order, or several Work Orders as a comma-delimited list  (11101, 11154, 11213).</P>
 <H2>12.4 Fill Backorders </H2>
 <P>Corrects problem with partially filled shop backorders where Fill Back Orders was posting to wrong Item. The Transfer Qty BO'd has been added to the BOM full screen view of the Shop Order.&nbsp;</P>
 <H2>12.5 COP Invoices </H2>
 <P>When COP orders are invoiced, extraneous pricing lines (with only a GL Entity and a Revenue Type) are no longer written to the AR Sales Journal.   </P>

 <H1>13. ServiceChannel FMMS</H1>
 <H2>13.0 Recent changes</H2>
 <P>Internal fixes to databridge and Quote Upload error.</P>
 <P>Proposal upload now includes the 'REQ_BY' Attribute.</P>
 <P>When the Upload to Service Channel button is pushed in the Quote Viewer, a confirming is displayed after the message has been queued for uploading </P>
 <H2>13.1 Introduction</H2>
 <P>The ServiceChannel FMMS Data Bridge provides an automated interface between Sampro and ServiceChannel’s FMMS web site. The Data Bridge provides the following services:<BR></P>
 <P style="margin-left:36.00pt;margin-top:0.00pt;">Transference of service requests entered on the ServiceChannel web site into the service provider’s Sampro system.</P>
 <P style="margin-left:36.00pt;margin-top:0.00pt;">The ability of Sampro service dispatchers to accept or decline incoming service requests.</P>
 <P style="margin-left:36.00pt;margin-top:0.00pt;">The attaching of accepted service requests to Sampro work orders.</P>
 <P style="margin-left:36.00pt;margin-top:0.00pt;">The ability of uploading Proposals to ServiceChannel from Quote Master.</P>
 <P style="margin-left:36.00pt;margin-top:0.00pt;">The posting of Check-In and Check-Out messages received from ServiceChannel to work orders.</P>
 <P style="margin-left:36.00pt;margin-top:0.00pt;">The forwarding to ServiceChannel of changes to a work order’s status.</P>
 <P style="margin-left:36.00pt;margin-top:0.00pt;">The forwarding to ServiceChannel of changes to a work order’s ETA.</P>
 <P style="margin-left:36.00pt;margin-top:0.00pt;">Uploading invoices to ServiceChannel when they are generated in Sampro.</P>
 <P style="margin-left:36.00pt;margin-top:0.00pt;">&nbsp;</P>
 <P style="margin-top:0.00pt;">The Message viewer now hides the message type of FMMS. The default setting of the Message Type range has been changed from !SageQuest to ~SageQuest,FMMS.</P>
 <H3>Registry Configuration Settings</H3>
 <P>See user note 2.15 for details on for the registry settings required to support the Service Channel Data Bridge. </P>
 <P>Note that it will be necessary to obtain a vrgstry.cus file with the FMMS option enable to support the Data Bridge. </P>
 <H3>Operational Scenario</H3>
 <P>From a Sampro user’s point of view, Sampro/ServiceChannel interactions go as follows:<BR></P>
 <P style="margin-left:36.00pt;margin-top:0.00pt;">- The service requester logs into ServiceChannel’s web site and initiates a service request.</P>
 <P style="margin-left:36.00pt;margin-top:0.00pt;">- ServiceChannel forward’s the service request to the service provider’s Sampro system where it appears in the ‘Web Log’.</P>
 <P style="margin-left:36.00pt;margin-top:0.00pt;">- Within Sampro’s New Call function, the dispatcher or other user double clicks on the Web Log Id field. A list of unacknowledged service requests will appear.</P>
 <P style="margin-left:36.00pt;margin-top:0.00pt;">- When the dispatcher picks a new service request from the list, a window showing details of the service request pops up. An example appears in the Appendix to this document.</P>
 <P style="margin-left:36.00pt;margin-top:0.00pt;">- After reviewing the service request, the dispatcher selects one of three buttons appearing at the bottom of the window:</P>
 <P style="margin-left:36.00pt;margin-top:0.00pt;">&nbsp;Cancel – Returns to New Call. The service requests stays on the Web Log list.</P>
 <P style="margin-left:72.00pt;margin-top:0.00pt;">Decline – The dispatcher is asked to choose from a list of permissible reason codes. After a reason code is selected, ServiceChannel is notified that the service request has been declined and the service request is removed from the Web Log list.</P>
 <P style="margin-left:72.00pt;margin-top:0.00pt;">Accept – The service request screen is closed and the New Call process continues with certain fields automatically populated with information gleaned from the service request. If and when New Call results in the creation of a new Sampro work order,</P>
 <P style="margin-left:36.00pt;margin-top:0.00pt;">A Note containing the contents of the service request is attached to the work order.</P>
 <P style="margin-left:36.00pt;margin-top:0.00pt;">- The service request is removed from the Web Log list.</P>
 <P style="margin-left:36.00pt;margin-top:0.00pt;">- If the service requestor requires a proposal before commencing work, the user can create a Sampro Quote and upload it to ServiceChannel as a Proposal. The Proposal can include previously incurred charges.</P>
 <P style="margin-left:36.00pt;margin-top:0.00pt;">- As technicians use ServiceChannel’s IVR system to check-in and check-out of work orders, the Data Bridge automatically updates the work orders accordingly.</P>
 <P style="margin-left:36.00pt;margin-top:0.00pt;">- Sampro tracks the work order as it changes status and ETAs. Service Channel is automatically notified when either of these changes takes place.</P>
 <P style="margin-left:36.00pt;margin-top:0.00pt;">- When the work order is invoiced, a spreadsheet containing invoice details is assembled and emailed to ServiceChannel.</P>
 <H3>13.2 Release Service Channel Updates </H3>
 <P>The SAM Pro data is now always updated when an Invoice has been uploaded to Service Channel. The user Id and password are correctly obtained from the registry. </P>
 <P>The Invoice Date uploaded to Service Channel now includes the time using the format 'mm/dd/yyyy hh:mm' where the hh:mm represents the current time.</P>
 <P>If the parts quantity is greater than one, the extended price is included in the invoice total. </P>
 <P style="margin-left:36.00pt;margin-top:0.00pt;">&nbsp;</P>
 <H1>14. Requisitioning</H1>
 <H2>14.1 Fill Backorders</H2>
 <P>This function now handles negative quantities properly. </P>
 <P><FONT style="font-weight:bold; " >Start Update WorkOrder Reference fields in IMHistory (</FONT><FONT style="font-weight:bold; " >Requisitioning</FONT><FONT style="font-weight:bold; " >)</FONT></P>
 <P>You may need to run Start Function List Update to see this new function. This function should be run for all installations that might have fill backorder records that are associated with a workorder: consult your support report for details. </P>
 <H2>14.2 Start Technician Pickup</H2>
 <P>The ‘To’ location is now a required field. </P>
 <P>The Transfer From Location and Transfer To Location can be double-clicked to select from a list. If the user types in an Id, the system immediately validates that it is a valid Location Id.</P>
 <P>This function creates an Inventory Adjustment Journal entry, but does not provide access to the Effective Date and Accounting Period fields so the defaulted values are always used.&nbsp; In previous releases, this meant that sometimes (for example, at the beginning of the month) the default Effective Date (today) and the Accounting Period flagged as Default could be out of sync. A registry entry is now available to adjust either of the values to keep them in sync.&nbsp;See user note 2.19 for details. </P>
 <P>In the absence of this registry option, the Material Pickup function will adjust the period and use today’s date as the default date.</P>
 <H2>14.3 Start Release Work Order</H2>
 <P>A new registry entry (see user note 2.27) may be implemented to set the status of released work orders (typically, to Parts Received). </P>
 <P>In addition, Parts Received has been removed from the filter default for this function.</P>
 <H2>14.4 Start Material Requisitioning </H2>
 <P>A new field, Date As Of, has been added to the initial screen of Start Material Requistioning. When completed, this field will omit requisitioned items that have a date required in advance of the date. The check list screen will exclude requisitioned inventory with a date required greater than the date specified.</P>
 <H2>15. CRMAnywhere </H2>
 <P>The sidebar graphic now correctly appears on the Print Quote page. The Quote now also supports the CRMReportType registry option of pdf; if this option is implemented, the Quote itself will be displayed in pdf format.</P>
 <P>Various performance enhancements have been added to this build.</P>
 <P>An obsolete records flag was added to many records in 7.2. Obsolete records will no longer be displayed in CRMAnywhere and CSRAnywhere drop down lists. </P>
 <P>Login screen message added: “Please Note: This Website is best viewed with Internet Explorer.” </P>
 <P>This build also cancels reporting of 'spurious' os errors.</P>
 <H3>15.1 Enhancements to Various Pages</H3>
 <P><FONT style="font-weight:bold; " >Site View and Completed Work Order Pages</FONT></P>
 <P style="margin-left:36.00pt;">Once a site had been selected, it was difficult for the user to ‘go back’ and show all work orders, or select a different site. A ‘Clear’ button has been added that, when clicked, clears the Site Id and allows the user to easily select a different site.</P>

 <P>In the Logon screen, the system displays the message 'No user record found for the employee linked to this technician' if the Employee Id in the Tech record does not link to a User record. The web server remains running.</P>

A problem may exist for General items received in the Inventory Received Journal – the cost was truncated, not rounded (e.g., .068 was truncated to .06 instead of being rounded to .07).  This problem has been corrected in the Inventory Receipts Journal.  However, if you have existing data with this problem, the Start Close Completed PO function may be used to individually close PO’s.  </P>

 <P style="margin-left:36.00pt;">If the DefaultJobByEquipmentId=true registry value is set, the Job, Cost Code, Billing Item default from the  Equipment record. In this case, the system only defaults job values if the Equipment Id is entered or changed.</P>

 <P style="margin-left:36.00pt;">The system now applies the AutoFillReceived registry setting (from sys-viewer-vprchseordrlst)  when making Subcontractor POs (e.g., when PO’s are created for a subcontractor in Create PM Work Orders). If autofill is enabled by registry, checking the Vendor field Disable PO Autofill prevents the autofill.</P>
