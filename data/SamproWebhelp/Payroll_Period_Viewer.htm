<h1>Payroll Period Viewer</h1>
<h2>Purpose:</h2>
<p>Create and maintain Payroll Periods.</p>
<h2>Usage:</h2>
<p>Required for Payroll.</p>
<h2>Registry Entries:</h2>
<p>Field level verification (for the Accrue to GL, Pay With EFT, Accrue 
 PTO, Remote Tech Use boxes may be enabled via the registry entry described 
 in <a href="Registry_Entry_Payroll_Period.htm">Registry Entry - Payroll 
 Period</a>. This registry may also be used to enable the Post History 
 button for payroll service users.</p>
<p><a href="Registry_Entry_Global_Settings__Column_Compression__Dispatch_Board_Rows__History_Log_Inventory_Markup.htm#PR_Period_Standard_Cost_Only">Designate 
 a Payroll Period to be Standard Cost Only</a> in Global 
 Settings Registry</p>
<h2>Important Fields:</h2>
<p><font style="font-weight: bold;">Note:</font> this Help Topic lists 
 the standard configuration of all fields that may be included in this 
 record. If you are using a customized system, the fields displayed on 
 your screen may not exactly match the fields described in this Topic.</p>
<p><font style="font-weight: bold;">Pay Period Id:</font> (15 character, 
 only . and - special characters)<br/>
This required field must uniquely identify this record.</p>
<p style="text-indent: 30.25pt;"><font style="font-weight: bold;">Hint:</font> 
 include the year as part of your Id.</p>
<p><font style="font-weight: bold;">Description:</font> (40 character)<br/>
Briefly describes this Payroll Period or its use. This field is optional.</p>
<p><font style="font-weight: bold;">Default Period</font><br/>
If this box is flagged for an active accounting period, it will default 
 in the following cases:</p>
<p style="margin-left: 48px;"> When creating a new Labor Journal transaction 
 (in the regular Labor Journal)<br/>
 When entering a Work Order Labor line</p>
<p>Double-click on this box to check/clear it. If you use the current default 
 payroll period to create the new default payroll period (and you leave 
 the Default Payroll Period box checked), the system will ask if this period 
 should replace the existing period as the default. If you click &#39;Yes&#39;, 
 the system will remove the default flag from the older period, and save 
 the new period with the Default box checked. If you answer &#39;No&#39;, you must 
 clear the Default Payroll Period box (by double-clicking on it or pressing 
 the Spacebar) before the system will let you change the record.</p>
<p style="margin-left: 8px;"><span style="font-weight: normal;">Validation prevents a Payroll Period 
 from being flagged as both Default and Executive Payroll. </span></p>
<p>When a Payroll Period record is saved, 
 the user is warned if there is no Payroll Period flagged as Default.  </p>
<p><font style="font-weight: bold;">Pay with EFT Field</font><br/>
This field must be checked (by double-clicking on it or pressing the Spacebar) 
 in order to produce direct deposit information and an Electronic Funds 
 Transfer (EFT) file. If this field is not checked, employees will be paid 
 with a live paycheck regardless of the status of the DDEP fields in the 
 Employee record. For example, if you wished to hand out live bonus checks, 
 you would assign them to a payroll period with the Pay with EFT field 
 blank. This field effects the Print Paychecks function.</p>
<p><font style="font-weight: bold;">Period:</font><br/>
This Accounting Period will be used as the default when payroll checks 
 are printed. Enter a valid Accounting Period Id or double-click (or press 
 Alt+F7) to select from a list. Note that this Accounting Period should 
 be active when checks are printed.</p>
<p><font style="font-weight: bold;">Accrue to GL?</font><br/>
If this field is checked (by double-clicking or pressing the Spacebar), 
 the system will automatically make GL accruals when you create time card 
 entries in the Labor Journal for Earnings (and Earning Groups) also flagged 
 as Accrue to GL. If this field is checked, t<font style="font-weight: bold;">he 
 GL Credit Account (and Entity, if appropriate) in your Earnings records</font> 
 <font style="font-weight: bold;">that are flagged to Accrue</font> <font style="font-weight: bold;">must be completed with the appropriate 
 accrued payroll account.</font></p>

<p>If this box is not checked, earnings for this Payroll Period will not 
 be automatically accrued to GL, regardless of how the Accrue to GL flag 
 is set in the Earnings or Earnings Group records.</p>
<p style="margin-left: 36.00pt; border-top: 0.50pt solid #000000; border-bottom: 0.50pt solid #000000; 
	 border-left: 0.50pt solid #000000; border-right: 0.50pt solid #000000;"><font style="font-weight: bold;">NOTE:  BONUS</font> amounts (entered 
 on the Labor Journal) will <font style="font-weight: bold;">NOT</font> 
 Accrue/post to<br/>
the GL, regardless of how this field is checked.</p>
<p><font style="font-weight: bold;">Accrue PTO</font><font style="font-weight: bold;"><br/>
</font>If this field is blank, Paid Time Off hours (as defined in the Employee 
 record PTO tab) will not be accrued for this Payroll Period (e.g., for 
 bonus pay). This field effects the Compute Payroll function. Note that 
 the PTO accrual will only take place when compute payroll is run if the 
 Start and End dates of the payroll period intersect with the Start and 
 End Dates of the PTO tab of the Employee record.</p>
<p style="margin-left: 36.00pt;"><font style="font-weight: bold;">Note: 
 PTO Accrual and Special Pay Periods<br/>
</font>Typically, PTO Hours would <font style="text-decoration: underline; ">not</font> 
 be accrued on payroll periods created for special purposes such as cutting 
 yearly <a href="Bonus_Payroll_Checks.htm">Bonus Payroll Checks</a>. Accruing 
 PTO Hours for these special periods would result in more than the desired 
 number of accruals being made (for example, 13 instead of 12 for employees 
 that are paid monthly).</p>
<p><font style="font-weight: bold;">Period Start Date:  Period End 
 Date:</font><br/>
Enter the range of work dates included in this pay period in <font style="font-style: italic;">mmddyyyy</font> 
 format (or double-click on this field to access the Calendar to do so). 
 <span id="BugEvents2711">Validation ensures that the Payroll Period End 
 Date does NOT precede the Payroll Period Start Date when the record is 
 saved.  The system also validates that the Check End Date does 
 not precede the Check Start Date. Note that it is not an error when the 
 Start Date and End Date are the same.</span></p>
<p><font style="font-weight: bold;">Start Check Date:  End Check Date:</font><br/>
Enter the range of payroll check dates valid for this pay period. This 
 Check Date may fall after the Payroll Period date range, but it must fall 
 within the Accounting Period Date range; the system will verify this when 
 you save or change this record. Validation also ensures the Start and 
 End Check dates are both within the payroll Year.</p>
<p><font style="font-weight: bold;">Period Status: Active Inactive</font><br/>
Select the correct status for this payroll period (Active, Inactive) by 
 double-clicking on the circular radio button next to the desired Period 
 Status (keyboard users should Tab to the desired radio button and then 
 press the Spacebar to select it). If a Payroll Period Record is flagged 
 as inactive, you will be unable to complete a journal entry with it.</p>
<p><img src="assets/images/Post History.bmp" alt="" style="border: none;" border="0"/></p>
<p>This button should only be enabled (via registry) for payroll service 
 users who export data (e.g, to ADP), but do not print and post checks.  If 
 you use the Post History function, you cannot afterwards print and post 
 a paycheck for the select Pay Period for employees impacted by the post. 
  When run, it sets the Payroll History Date Effective to the Last 
 Check Date from the Payroll Period, and the Source Journal to the text 
 you specify via registry  ‘ADP Export’ by default. This process replaces 
 the print/post check functionality to enable the use of certain payroll 
 reports.  </p>
<p>If SAMPro versions prior to 9.1.611.058, if an error is noted, the Payroll 
 Period will show an &quot;ERROR&quot; which was not addressed. Since the 
 sort of errors noted in this process do not impact the ADP and other payroll 
 services, the error count will be set to zero so that updates will not 
 display as Errors on the Payroll Period. </p>
<p> </p>

<p><font style="font-weight: bold;">Prior Period Accruals:<br/>
Period End Date:  Accounting Period Id:</font><br/>
If the Accrue to GL box is flagged, <font style="font-weight: bold; font-style: italic;">and</font> 
 this Payroll Period crosses an Accounting Period, enter the last work 
 date of the period to be accrued to the specified Prior Period Accounting 
 Period. The system will verify the date ranges that are selected. The 
 display-only Period Status field defaults from the Accounting Period record. 
 <font style="font-weight: bold;">If prior period accruals are implemented, 
 the GL Credit Account (and Entity, if appropriate) in your Earnings records</font> 
 <font style="font-weight: bold;">that are flagged to Accrue</font> <font style="font-weight: bold;">must be completed with the appropriate 
 accrued payroll account.</font></p>
<p style="margin-left: 36.00pt;"><font style="font-weight: bold;">Important 
 Note on</font> <font style="font-weight: bold;">Start WO Entry:</font> 
 if your firm uses the Start Work Order Entry function to entry time and 
 materials, this field must be completed if your Pay Periods cross monthly 
 boundaries.</p>
<p style="margin-left: 36.00pt;"><font style="text-decoration: underline; ">Example 
 1: Prior Period Accruals Not Needed</font></p>
<p style="margin-left: 36.00pt;">Payroll Period Start: Jun 6, 2004  End: 
 Jun 6, 2004<br/>
Check Start: Jun 17, 2004 Check End: Jun 17, 2004<br/>
Accounting Period Start: Jun 1, 2004 End: Jun 30, 2004</p>
<p class="Reference_Line" style="margin-left: 102.25pt; margin-bottom: 0.00pt;">Since 
 the Payroll Period does not cross an Accounting Period, there is no need 
 to complete the Prior Period Accrual fields should remain blank.</p>
<p style="margin-left: 36.00pt;"><font style="text-decoration: underline; ">Example 
 2: Prior Period Accruals Needed</font></p>
<p style="margin-left: 36.00pt;">Payroll Period Start: Jun 27, 2004 End: 
 Jul 3, 2004<br/>
Check Start: Jul 10, 2004 End: Jul 10, 2004<br/>
Accounting Period Start: Jul 1, 2004 End: Jul 31, 2004</p>
<p class="Reference_Line" style="margin-left: 102.25pt; margin-bottom: 0.00pt;">Since 
 the Payroll Period <font style="text-decoration: underline; ">does</font> 
 cross an Accounting Period, the Prior Period Accrual fields should be 
 completed. Note that the Check Dates should fall within the Accounting 
 Period, <font style="text-decoration: underline; ">not</font> the Prior 
 Period Accounting Period.</p>
<p style="margin-left: 102.25pt;">Prior Period Accruals:<br/>
Period End Date: Jun 30, 2004<br/>
Accounting Period Start: Jun 1, 2004 End: Jun 30, 2004</p>
<p><font style="font-weight: bold;">Year: Quarter: Month:</font><br/>
Indicate which Year, Quarter and calendar Month this Payroll Period should 
 be assigned to for Reporting and Deduction Limit calculations. Should 
 be based upon the date of the check.</p>
<p style="margin-left: 36.00pt;"><font style="font-weight: bold;">941 Report:<br/>
</font> For the 941 Report to show daily tax liability, the month must 
 be entered as the calendar month (1-12) and not the month in the quarter.</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: bold;">Deduction 
 Cycles</span><br/>
 If completed, this field provides the default values for Start Compute 
 Payroll&#39;s Pay/Deductions fields so that Deduction will not be accidentally 
 skipped. Deduction Cycle information is maintained in the Deductions Group 
 record (for union payroll) and the Employee Deduction tab (non-union). 
 Up to five Deduction Cycles may be specified; they should NOT be separated 
 by commas.</p>
<p style="margin-left: 48px; text-decoration: underline; ">Examples:</p>
<p style="margin-left: 48px;">If a Deduction 
 Code of M is used for Monthly deductions, it would be entered in the Deduction 
 Cycle of Payroll Periods used for Monthly pay.</p>
<p style="margin-left: 48px;">If Deductions 
 Codes are not used for Bonus pays, the Deduction Cycle could be set to 
 XXXXX to prevent all Deductions from being taken. A Deduction will not 
 be taken unless its cycle is specified; if a Deduction Cycle is blank 
 in the Employee or Deduction Group, it wlll be taken if one of the Deduction 
 Cycle fields in the Payroll Period is blank. Setting all fields to X or 
 another character never used for Deduction Cycles will prevent this.</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: bold;">Accrue 
 Bonus Pay:</span><br/>
This field is in conjunction with the <a href="Registry_Entry_Global_Settings__Column_Compression__Dispatch_Board_Rows__History_Log_Inventory_Markup.htm#Enable_Optional_Accrual_for_Bonus_Pay">AccrueBonusPay 
 registry setting</a> in sys-ffv-global-settings.  If this field is 
 set to True AND the registry is set to true, bonus pay entered for this 
 Payroll Period will accrue. If this field is set to False or is blank, 
 bonus pay will NOT accrue regardless of whether or not the AccrueBonusPay 
 setting is enabled.</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: bold;">Executive 
 Payroll</span><br/>
 When this field is flagged, only users who have the Executive Payroll 
 field flagged in their User record can:</p>
<p style="margin-left: 48px;">Access the 
 Payroll Period Record<br/>
 Access Labor Journal Transaction for Executive Payroll Periods<br/>
 Run Compute Payroll for Executive Payroll Periods<br/>
 Print Payroll Checks for Executive Payroll Periods<br/>
 Print PR Miscellaneous Deduction Checks for Executive Payroll Periods<br/>
Flag a new Payroll Period as Executive Payroll</p>
<p style="margin-left: 48px; box-sizing: border-box;">The 
 Executive Payroll status of the Payroll Period is NOT considered when 
 printing W2&#39;s or T4&#39;s.  Employees flagged as Executive Payroll will 
 only appear on these reports if the User running the report is flagged 
 as Executive P/R. </p>
<p style="margin-left: 48px; font-weight: normal;">Validation 
 prevents a Payroll Period from being flagged as both Default and Executive 
 Payroll. </p>
<p><font style="font-weight: bold;">Remote Technician Applet:<br/>
Ok to Use?<br/>
</font>Check this box if this Payroll Period may be selected for time entries 
 made from TechAnywhere or TimeAnywhere.</p>
<p style="font-weight: bold;">Pay Period User1:  Pay Period User2:<br/>

 enabled via registry (<a href="Registry_Entry_Global_Settings__Column_Compression__Dispatch_Board_Rows__History_Log_Inventory_Markup.htm#PR_Period_Standard_Cost_Only" style="font-weight: normal;">Designate a Payroll 
 Period to be Standard Cost Only</a> in Global Settings Registry) setting 
 a field true will designate this Payroll Period for Standard Costing only. 
  Note that a Standard Cost Payroll Period should never be set as 
 Default. </span></p>
<p>If not used to implement Standard Costing, 
 these optional fields may be used for entering any information your company 
 wishes to retain.</p>
<p class="Tab">Hours Tab</p>
<p style="font-weight: bold;">Employee - Regular – Overtime – Dbl Time 
 Holiday – Vacation – Sick – Other – Total</p>
<p>These fields indicate the number of hours recorded for each employee 
 for this Payroll Period.</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: bold;">T</span>he Hours Tab is filtered based 
 on the User&#39;s Executive PR and Branch Filter fields. Data for Executive 
 Payroll Employees (Executive P/R flagged in the Employee record) will 
 only be displayed if the User&#39;s Executive PR? box is checked in their 
 User record.</p>
<p><span>Filtering based on the User&#39;s Branch Filter only comes into play 
 when the hard-block filtering option is turned on via the global registry 
 option BranchFilterWithHardBlock enabled.</span></p>
<p style="font-weight: bold;">Status:</p>
<p>The Status of each line is determined for each employee as follows:</p>
<p style="margin-left: 48px;">**ERRORS**: errors prevented Compute Payroll 
 from being run successfully for this employee OR Labor was changed AFTER 
 the Compute Payroll was run for this employee.  No check will 
 be created until the Compute Payroll is run and the error has cleared.</p>
<p style="margin-left: 48px;">*NOT COMPUTED*: Compute Payroll has not yet 
 been run for this employee.</p>
<p style="margin-left: 48px;">*UNPOSTED*: Payroll has been computed successfully, 
 but either a pay check has not been posted, or the Post History button 
 has not been used to post history. </p>
<p style="margin-left: 48px;">Check #: This pay check was printed and posted 
 in SAMPro.</p>
<p style="margin-left: 48px;">The Status column shows the &#39;PostSourceDescription&#39; 
 value for exports to a payroll service  when none of the other options 
 apply. </p>
