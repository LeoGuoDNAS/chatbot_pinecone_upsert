<h1>Currency Conversion Notes</h1>
<p>These notes assume that Currency Conversion for GL and Job History are both enabled via the <a href="Registry_Entry_Currency_Adjustment.htm">Currency Adjustment Registry</a> and the <a href="Currency_Master_Record.htm">Currency Master</a> record.</p>
<h2>AR and Invoicing Records:</h2>
<h3>Client Viewer</h3>
<p><font style="font-weight: bold;">Currency Id:<br/></font>If you will be billing your foreign clients in their currency, and receiving their payments in their currency, this field must be completed.</p>
<p>If you are updating an existing Client record, this field must only be changed if there is no current activity on the account (e.g, unpaid bills). In this way, new invoices will be sent and received in the Client’s currency. If you cannot clear an account, you may need to create a new client and job records so that all new revenues will be in the correct (foreign) denomination.</p>
<h3>Rate Schedule</h3>
<p>Separate Rate Schedules must be created for your foreign currency customers and referenced in the applicable Job records. These Rate Schedules must reference Labor, Material and Other Rate Tables that specify the revenues in terms of the foreign currency – as you wish them to appear on invoices.</p>
<p><font style="font-weight: bold;">Vendor Record – Service Provider Rates: Rate Schedule Id:<br/></font>If foreign currency processing is implemented on your system, the Rate Schedule should be maintained in the currency of the subcontractor.</p>
<h3>Labor Rate Table</h3>
<p>Separate Labor Rate tables must be created for your foreign currency customers. These tables must specify the Labor revenue in terms of the foreign currency – as you wish it to appear on the invoices.</p>
<p style="margin-left: 48px;"><font style="font-weight: bold;">Note:</font> Typically, you would not need to create a whole new set of individual labor rates. Instead, simply use the Labor Rate Table to provide appropriate revenue rates for the foreign currency.</p>
<p style="margin-left: 8px;"><span style="font-weight: bold;">Rate: Bill Type Id:</span><br/>
If your Bill Type Id is set to Unit Price, your Rate must be specified in terms of the foreign currency, as it will appear on the invoice.</p>
<p>If you are marking up labor based on costs (for Bill Types of Margin, Markup or Multiplier), remember that the costs will be maintained in your local currency. The Rate must include the adjustment from the local cost to the foreign revenue.</p>
<h3>Other Rate Table</h3>
<p>Separate Other Rate tables must be created for your foreign currency customers. These tables must specify the Other revenue in terms of the foreign currency – as you wish it to appear on the invoices.</p>
<p><font style="font-weight: bold;">Note:</font> Typically, you would not need to create a whole new set of individual other rates. Instead, simply use the Other Rate Table to provide appropriate revenue rates for the foreign currency.</p>
<p><font style="font-weight: bold;">Level:<br/></font>If used, levels are specified in terms of local costs.</p>
<p><font style="font-weight: bold;">Rate: Bill Type Id:</font><font style="font-weight: bold;"><br/></font>If your Bill Type Id is set to Unit Price, your Rate must be specified in terms of the foreign currency, as it will appear on the invoice.</p>
<p>If you are marking up other items based on costs (for Bill Types of Margin, Markup or Multiplier), remember that the costs will be maintained in your local currency. <font style="font-weight: bold; font-style: italic;">The Rate must include the adjustment from the local cost to the foreign revenue.</font></p>
<h3>Material Rate Table</h3>
<p>Separate Material Rate tables must be created for your foreign currency customers. If your inventory items are not ‘unit price’, these tables must specify the material markup such that your material costs (which are maintained in your local currency) are marked up to an appropriate foreign revenue. Note that this material markup will also be applied to miscellaneous materials.</p>
<p><font style="font-weight: bold;">Level:<br/></font>If used, levels are specified in terms of local costs.</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: bold;">Rate:</span><br/>
Costs will be maintained in your local currency. The Rate must include the adjustment from the local cost to the foreign revenue.</p>
<h3>Inventory Item</h3>
<h5>Pricing/Costing Tab</h5>
<p><font style="font-weight: bold;">Unit Prices:<br/></font><font style="font-weight: bold;">If you are not using price codes:</font> Up to 9 unit prices may be specified per item. Your firm may choose to reserve one or more of these levels to use with foreign currency (e.g., levels 1-3 for local currency, 4-6 for foreign currency A, 7-9 for foreign currency B). If so, the price should be entered in terms of the foreign currency, as it should appear on the foreign customer’s invoice.</p>
<p><font style="font-weight: bold;">If you sometimes use price codes:</font> since price codes only support 5 levels, your firm should limit the pricing structure to 5 levels. In this case, your firm may choose to reserve one or more of these levels to use of foreign currency (e.g., levels 1-3 your local currency, 4 for foreign currency A, 5 for foreign currency B). If so, the price should be entered in terms of the foreign currency, as it should appear on the foreign customer’s invoice.</p>
<p><font style="font-weight: bold;">Important Note:</font> Be sure to correctly specify the <font style="font-weight: bold; font-style: italic;">Material Price Level in the Job and the Client Site records</font>. These fields provide the default price levels for Job and COP invoices.</p>
