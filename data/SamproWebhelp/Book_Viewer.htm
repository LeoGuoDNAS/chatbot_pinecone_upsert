<h1>Book Viewer</h1>
<h2>Purpose:</h2>
<p>This viewer makes it easier for users to create a &quot;package&quot; of documents that can be easily transmitted to their customers. For example, service invoices along with supporting collateral such as scanned paper work orders or TechAnywhere receipts for a specific customer may be assembled into a .PDF Book and emailed to that customer. Currently, this function supports Invoice related documents as well as any attachments to the work order associated with the invoice.</p>
<p>The Book viewer is security-aware based on the Security Id in the Invoice Master Record.</p>
<p>Books were designed to be used for assemble a discrete batch of documents (such as all invoices w/associated collateral for January 2013 for a particular client).</p>
<h2>Registry Entry:</h2>
<p>See <a href="Registry_Book_Viewer.htm">Registry Book Viewer</a> for an entry that specifies where the Book’s PDF files are saved. If this registry entry is not in places, these files will be saved in their respective folders in the main SAM Pro directory. This registry is strongly advised.</p>
<p>In previous releases, when .PDF files were created, they were immediately displayed. Since this could generate an alarming number of windows, the default is to NOT display the .PDF or Workspace files. If you would prefer that the .PDF files be displayed as they are generated, see <a href="Registry_Book_Viewer.htm">Registry Book Viewer</a> for a registry to restore the previous behavior.</p>
<h2>Usage:</h2>
<p style="margin-left: 36.00pt;">1. Complete the required fields on the Main and User fields tab as discussed below.</p>
<p style="margin-left: 36.00pt;">2. On the Select Documents tab, set the Client Id, Start and End Dates, and PDF by Chapters field (if desired). Also complete any desired Range fields.</p>
<p style="margin-left: 72.00pt;"><font style="font-weight: bold;">Tip:</font> The Save Model button lets you save your Chapters, PDF and Ranges settings. The Select a Model button may then be used as a shortcut to setting these fields.</p>
<p style="margin-left: 36.00pt;">3. Click the Autopopulate button to generate the list of documents in the lower section that will be used to create the Book.</p>
<p style="margin-left: 72.00pt;"><font style="font-weight: bold;">Important Note:</font> Workorders Invoiced More than Once<br/>
If a Work Order has been invoiced more than once, and one of the invoices falls within the Start and End Date, ALL Invoices and other allowed documents for that Work Order will be included when the Autopopulate button is clicked. The user should carefully review the documents added to the list, and delete the lines for those that do NOT pertain to the selected invoices, as well as for possible duplicates.</p>
<p style="margin-left: 36.00pt;">4. Add or Save the Book record.</p>
<p style="margin-left: 36.00pt;">5. Click the Make PDF button; the system will generate one or more PDF files consisting of the documents specified below, and display them for you. In version 8.1 and above, a registry entry is required for the files to be automatically displayed.</p>
<p style="margin-left: 36.00pt;">6. You may email your pdf’s directly from the Adobe Reader windows, or via the Book Viewer’s Email button (which attaches all saved PDF’s for this Book to the email).</p>
<p style="margin-left: 72.00pt;"><font style="font-weight: bold;">Note for Outlook Users:<br/></font>Since the Outlook mail client may have issues with pathing on multiple attachments, the SAMPro mailer is launched if multiple attachments exist, even if UseOutlook is set to True in the sys-email registry. If only a single attachment exists, the Outlook email form will be used if UseOutlook is set to true.</p>
<p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"> </p>
<h2>Important Fields: Upper Section</h2>
<p class="Tab" style="background-color: #e5e5e5; border-top: 1.50pt solid #000000; border-bottom: 1.50pt solid #000000; border-left: 1.50pt solid #000000; border-right: 1.50pt solid #000000;">Main Tab</p>
<p><font style="font-weight: bold;">Book Id:</font> <font style="font-weight: bold;"><br/></font>This field is required, and should uniquely identify this Book record. It is 50 characters in length to allow for a very descriptive Id. <font style="font-weight: bold;">You may use letters and numbers in the Id, but the characters \ / :</font> <font style="font-weight: bold;">*</font> ? <font style="font-weight: bold;">“ &lt; &gt; and | must not be used because they are denied for Windows folder names, and the Id is used to generate the name of the folder the PDF will be placed in. <span style="font-weight: normal;">The system will not allow these restricted characters to be entered.</span> </font></p>
<p>The Book Id will also be used to generate the Document Description and the filename of the PDF file(s). If PDF by Chapters is flagged, the filename will consist of the Book Id followed by the Site Id (if the Chapters By Site option is selected) or the Invoice Id (if the Chapters by Invoice is selected).</p>
<p><font style="font-weight: bold;">Book Name:</font><font style="font-weight: bold;"><br/></font>This 60-character field allows additional description of the Book’s purpose/contents for lookup and documentation purposes. For example, if your Book Id begins with a Client or Site Id, you might was to start the Name with Invoices or Job Invoice.</p>
<p><font style="font-weight: bold;">Book Description:</font><font style="font-weight: bold;"><br/></font>This field allows for a more detailed description of this Book to be entered by the user.</p>
<p><font style="font-weight: bold;">Reference Type:<br/></font>This display only field is maintained by the system when the record is saved. Currently, the Reference Type of Client is supported.</p>
<p><font style="font-weight: bold;">Reference Id:<br/></font>This display only field is maintained by the system. Currently, it is set based on the Client Id selected on the Select Documents Tab when the record is saved.</p>
<p class="Tab" style="background-color: #e5e5e5; border-top: 1.50pt solid #000000; border-bottom: 1.50pt solid #000000; border-left: 1.50pt solid #000000; border-right: 1.50pt solid #000000;">UserFields Tab</p>
<p><font style="font-weight: bold;">BookUser1-5:<br/></font>These fields may be completed for informational purposes.</p>
<p class="Tab" style="background-color: #e5e5e5; border-top: 1.50pt solid #000000; border-bottom: 1.50pt solid #000000; border-left: 1.50pt solid #000000; border-right: 1.50pt solid #000000;">Select Documents Tab</p>
<p><font style="font-weight: bold;">Client Id:<br/></font> This field is required in order to use the Autopopulate feature.</p>
<p><font style="font-weight: bold;">Chapters: By Site – By Invoice<br/>
PDF by Chapters?<br/></font>These fields details how the PDF will be created: if the PDF by Chapter box is blank, a single PDF will be generated. If the PDF by Chapter box is check a separate PDF will be made for each Invoice or for each Site.</p>
<p><font style="font-weight: bold;">Omit Booked Invoices</font><font style="font-weight: bold;">?</font><font style="font-weight: bold;"><br/></font>When this field is flagged, only those documents related to invoices that have not yet been included in a Book document will be included list when the Autopopulate button is clicked.</p>
<p><font style="font-weight: bold;">Start Date: End Date:<br/></font>The system uses the effective date of posted invoices to control which documents are selected via the Auto Populate button. Unless limited by the range fields below, all documents associated with the invoice, plus those associated with the invoice’s work order are eligible for inclusion.</p>
<p>Note that the Date fields are NOT stored in the Book record or range Models.</p>
<p><font style="font-weight: bold;">Category:</font> <font style="font-weight: bold;">Description:</font> <font style="font-weight: bold;">Site Id:</font> <font style="font-weight: bold;">Job Id:</font> <font style="font-weight: bold;">Invoice Numbe</font><font style="font-weight: bold;">r:</font><br/>
These range fields allow for additional filtering.</p>
<p style="margin-left: 36.00pt;"><font style="font-weight: bold;">E</font><font style="font-weight: bold;">xample</font><font style="font-weight: bold;">:</font> <font style="font-weight: bold;">Invoices Only</font><br/>
If this Book is being used to assemble only SAM Pro invoices, the Category should always be set to Invoice to avoid including worksheets or other documents in the run to the work order in the run.</p>
<p style="margin-left: 36.00pt;"><font style="font-weight: bold;">Example: TechAnywhere Attachments and Invoices<br/></font>If TechAnywhere is implemented for your company, you may wish to set the Category range to pick up invoices as well as those TechAnywhere document categories your customer requires for payment. The following list specifies the standard document categories used by TechAnywhere:</p>
<p style="margin-left: 72.00pt;"><font style="font-weight: bold;">Document Category (</font><font style="font-weight: bold;">Description</font><font style="font-weight: bold;">)</font></p>
<p style="margin-left: 72.00pt;">Receipt   (Completed TA non-COD workorders)</p>
<p style="margin-left: 72.00pt;">Invoice   (Completed TA COD workorders)</p>
<p style="margin-left: 72.00pt;">Signature  (Signature captured at time of completing workorder)</p>
<p style="margin-left: 72.00pt;">TA Attachments  (Document/File attached from TA Android)</p>
<p style="margin-left: 72.00pt;">Other   (Document/File attached from TA Windows)</p>
<p style="margin-left: 72.00pt;">Picture    (Camera photo attached from TA Android)</p>
<p style="margin-left: 72.00pt;">Tech Completed PDF (PDF forms filled out from TA Android)</p>
<p style="margin-left: 72.00pt;">CC Authorization  (Credit card authorization forms from TA Android)</p>
<p style="margin-left: 36.00pt;">In this example setting the Category range to: Invoice,Receipt,Picture</p>
<p style="margin-left: 36.00pt;">would include SAM Pro invoices, TechAnywhere receipts, and photos from the TechAnywhere Android app.  </p>
<p style="margin-left: 36.00pt;"><font style="font-weight: bold;">Tip:</font> Be sure to save your ranges as a Model: your next batch of documents will be quicker to assemble because you can simply Select a Model with the click of a button. Models will also ensure consistency in the document selection process between runs.</p>
<p style="margin-left: 36.00pt;"><font style="font-weight: bold;">Tip:</font> These fields are NOT stored in the Book record. They should be completed (by keying them in, or selecting a Model) AFTER the Book record is saved/added but BEFORE clicking Autopopulate.</p>
<h3>Important Buttons:</h3>
