  <h1>Version 9.1 Customer Release Notes - 9.1.611.062c</h1>
  <h3>Escalation Statuses in SAMPro And DBAnalytics in 9.1.611.052+</h3>
  <p>The Work Order Escalation Statuses of Travel, Onsite, and On Break have been added to support additional granularity in Scheduled Events and reporting. These statuses were previously grouped together as Active. This will impact the existing range of Work Order Escalation filter and sub-filter settings in DBAnalytics. These filters should be reset manually when upgrading to SAMPro 9.1.611.052+ to ensure that your Work Orders are accurately displayed in DBAnalytics. See <a href="#An_Important_Note_for_Users_Upgrading_to_SAMPro_9.1.611.052_">An Important Note for Users Upgrading to 9.1.611.052+</a> for details.</p>

  <h1>1  System</h1>
  <h2>1.1 Registry Viewer</h2>
  <p><img alt="" border="0" src="assets/images/SKIN1_SortLines.bmp" style="border: none; cursor: nesw-resize;"/>  Due to the need to maintain certain Registry records in a specific order the Registry&#39;s lower pane is no longer sorted automatically when it is saved. Instead, the new Sort Lines button allows the user to resort to individual registry entries alphabetically.</p>
  <p>To do</p>
  <p>1. Complete any needed changes to the Registry record.</p>
  <p>2. Save (or Add) the Registry record.</p>
  <p>3. Click the Sort Lines button.</p>
  <p>4. Save the record again to retain the new Sort Order.</p>
  <p style="margin-left: 48px;"><span style="font-weight: bold;">Important:</span> The Registry viewer does NOT warn the user about losing unsaved changes if all the user did to a record is push the new SortLines button.  </p>
  <h3>1.1.1 Registry to Limit Software Expiration Warnings</h3>
  <p>By default, all SAMPro Users are warned if their software is close to expiration.  This registry changes the expiration warning so that only the specified Users or members of the specified User Groups are warned. If this registry is not present, all Users will continue to get the expiration warning on login.</p>
  <p><span style="font-weight: bold;">Id:</span> sys-expiration-notification</p>
  <p><span style="font-weight: bold;">Setting Key:</span> GroupId   <span style="font-weight: bold;">Setting Value:</span> <span style="font-style: italic;">comma-delimited list of User Group Id&#39;s</span></p>
  <p>This registry specifies the User Group(s) to receive the expiration warning. The system will evaluate the User Groups on the User&#39;s Main and Additional Groups tabs.</p>
  <p><span style="font-weight: bold;">Setting Key:</span> UserId   <span style="font-weight: bold;">Setting Value:</span> <span style="font-style: italic;">comma delimited list of User Id&#39;s</span></p>
  <p>This registry specifies the User or Users who should receive the expiration warning. The system will evaluate the User Groups on the User&#39;s Main and Additional Groups tabs.</p>
  <p style="margin-left: 48px;">TIP:<br/>
    Include the support user login in the list of UserId&#39;s to be alerted.</p>
  <p style="text-decoration: underline; ">Example:</p>
  <p style="margin-left: 48px;"><span style="font-weight: bold;">Id:</span> sys-expiration-notification</p>
  <p style="margin-left: 48px;"><span style="font-weight: bold;">Setting Key:</span> GroupId   <span style="font-weight: bold;">Setting Value:</span> IT, Executive </p>
  <p style="margin-left: 48px;"><span style="font-weight: bold;">Setting Key:</span> UserId   <span style="font-weight: bold;">Setting Value:</span> OfficeMgr,dbasics</p>
  <p style="margin-left: 48px;">In this example, members of the IT and Executive User groups as well as User OfficeMgr and dbasics support users would receive the expiration warning.</p>
  <h3>1.1.2 Disable Warning When User Accesses a Journal Entry That Has Been Replaced</h3>
  <p>When most SAMPro journals are edited, the revised entry&#39;s id is appended with a &#39;tack&#39; number. The original journal entry cannot be edited if it has been replaced with a new entry (with a &#39;tack&#39; number).  In this release, users are warned if they access a journal entry which has been replaced.  For example:</p>
  <p style="margin-left: 48px;">WARNING: Purchase Order 123456 has been replaced by 123456-01.</p>
  <p style="margin-left: 48px;">This record cannot be changed.</p>
  <p>This warning is designed to prevent the user from wasting time by attempting to make changes to a journal entry record that cannot be saved because it has already been replaced. This new default behavior may be disabled globally or by individual viewers:</p>
  <p><span style="font-weight: bold;">Registry Id:</span> sys-ffv-global-settings  (or by the individual viewer)</p>
  <p><span style="font-weight: bold;">Setting Key:</span> DisableCase6552 <span style="font-weight: bold;">Setting Value:</span> truethe </p>
  <h3>1.1.3 Saving reports to Disk (dbreportfiles)</h3>
  <p>Previously, there was no check to make sure that the path in the dbreportfiles directory entry referenced a valid file system directory. In this release:</p>
  <p style="margin-left: 48px;">- If a directory path is found in the Registry, but that path does not exist, an attempt will be made to create that directory.   </p>
  <p style="margin-left: 48px;">- If that directory creation fails (or no Registry entry is found) a default path referencing the &#39;Reports&#39; sub-directory within the SAMPro directory will be used. That directory will be automatically created if needed.   </p>
  <p style="margin-left: 48px;">- If all else fails, the path to the SAMPro directory itself will be used. This is what previously happened if the Registry entry was absent.</p>
  <h3>1.1.4 Default Journals&#39; Balance Sheet Entity for Intercompany Installations</h3>
  <p style="margin-left: 8px;">For installations not running with Intercompany enabled, &#39;sticky&#39; GL Entity fields in many Journals provided for the setting of the default balance sheet entity.</p>
  <p style="margin-left: 8px;">However, if Intercompany is enabled, the &#39;sticky&#39; behavior is turned off.  The following registries have been created to support a global registry key for Default Balance Sheet Entity setting as well as journal-specific override/exception registry keys. <span style="font-weight: bold;">These registries are particularly useful for single-company Intercompany new installations.</span>  </p>
  <h5>Registry to Enable Use of Default Balance Sheet Entity</h5>
  <p style="margin-left: 8px;">The following journals are impacted by this registry:</p>

  <p style="margin-left: 8px;"><span style="font-weight: bold;">Setting Key:</span> UseDefaultBalanceSheetEntity    <span style="font-weight: bold;">Setting Value:</span> true  (default is false)</p>
  <p style="margin-left: 8px;">If this registry is enabled, there are two ways to specify the Default Balance Sheet GL Entity Id:</p>
  <p style="margin-left: 8px;">1.  Use the following registry setting that explicitly provides the Id.</p>
  <p style="margin-left: 8px;">2.  Derive the GL Entity from the Company record if possible and default that. If the default has been explicitly defined in the following option, it overrules this option.</p>

  <p style="margin-left: 8px;"><span style="font-weight: bold;">Setting Key:</span>  DefaultBalanceSheetEntity  <span style="font-weight: bold;">Setting Value:</span> <span style="font-style: italic;">GLEntityId</span></p>
  <p style="margin-left: 8px;">The Setting Value should be replaced by an appropriate balance sheet GL Entity. If this registry is present it will be used and the system will not attempt to derive it from the Company record.</p>
  <p style="margin-left: 48px;"><span style="font-weight: bold;">Note:</span> Version 9.1.611.048 and above corrects a spurious &#39;has changed&#39; message in recent releases. This occurred when a blank journal entry form was left when the DefaultBalanceSheetEntity is designated.</p>
  <h3>1.1.5 Registry To Control Maximum Size of Error.log</h3>
  <p>Extremely large error logs are difficult for programmers to research and time-consuming for support to download.  In this release, after a successful logon if the error.log size is more than the maximum size of 1 gigabyte, then the error.log will be renamed as &#39;error [date/time stamp].log&#39;. Next, the system will send a new &#39;error&#39; message to the log stating &#39;error.log archived as whatever the renamed file name is&#39;. This will force the creation of a new error.log file. It will also document who did it and what the archived file name is.</p>
  <p>The following registry allows the user to override the maximum size for archiving the Error Log.</p>
  <p><span style="font-weight: bold;">Id: </span>sys-ffv-global-settings of the registry</p>
  <p><span style="font-weight: bold;">Setting Key:</span>  ErrorLogMaxSize  <span style="font-weight: bold;">Setting Value:</span> <span style="font-style: italic;">size in bytes</span></p>
  <p>The default is currently 1 Gigabyte (1073741824 bytes).  </p>
  <p style="margin-left: 48px;"><span style="text-decoration: underline; ">Example: Set maximum size of error.log to 250 Meg (a quarter of a gig).</span>  </p>
  <p style="margin-left: 48px;"><span style="font-weight: bold;">Id: </span>sys-ffv-global-settings of the registry</p>
  <p style="margin-left: 48px;"><span style="font-weight: bold;">Setting Key:</span>  ErrorLogMaxSize  <span style="font-weight: bold;">Setting Value:</span> 262144000 </p>
  <h3>1.1.6 Report Performance Enhancement</h3>
  <p>This release supports new registries which enable performance enhancements for all or specific user-defined reports such as the Service Invoice that are imported into the user&#39;s database. Note: This does NOT apply to system reports such as the Purchase Order.</p>
  <p style="font-weight: bold;">Apply Performance Enhancements to All or Selected Reports</p>
  <p><span style="font-weight: bold;">Id:</span> sys-behavior-reports  </p>
  <p><span style="font-weight: bold;">Setting Key:</span> ReportExtended   <span style="font-weight: bold;">Setting Value:</span> true   (default false)</p>
  <p>This option allows a user to invoke the performance enhancements contained in this case for all reports.</p>
  <p>The registry setting ReportExtended can also be added to any report registry to enable (true) or disable (false) the performance enhancements.</p>
  <p>For example, to enable for the Service Invoice only:</p>
  <p><span style="font-weight: bold;">Id:</span> sys-report-serviceinvoice</p>
  <p><span style="font-weight: bold;">Setting Key:</span> ReportExtended   <span style="font-weight: bold;">Setting Value:</span> true   (default false)</p>
  <p>This will enable the functionality for the Service Invoice (assuming that the sys-behavior-reports registry is not enabled or set to false).</p>
  <h3>1.1.7 Require Work Order for Service Compute Jobs - Various Journal-type viewers</h3>
  <h5>Registry Setting Global</h5>
  <p><span style="font-weight: bold;">Registry Id:</span> sys-ffv-global-settings</p>
  <p><span style="font-weight: bold;">Setting Key:</span> NeedWOInServiceComputeJobs  <span style="font-weight: bold;">Setting Value:</span> Warning, Error or Neither (default is Neither)</p>
  <p>Jobs indicated as &quot;Service Compute&quot; get billed by the Work Order, yet we allow costs to be entered and posted to Jobs w/o reference to any specific work order, leaving these unbilled costs in limbo. This new feature may be activated to warn or error if a Work Order is not specified for Jobs flagged as &#39;Service Compute&#39;.</p>
  <p>When this option is set in the global registry, it impacts the following Journals/Records:</p>
  <p style="margin-left: 48px;">AP Journal (tests are ignored for lines imported from a PO)<br/>
    AR Sales Journal<br/>
    Job Journal<br/>
    Labor Journal (tests are ignored on lines imported from TechAnywhere/TimeAnywhere<br/>
    Purchase Order</p>
  <p>When the Setting Value is set to <span style="font-weight: bold;">Error</span>, the user will be alerted when leaving a line lacking a Work Order Id and will not be able to save the record. Note: Implementing an Error on an existing system impacts the user&#39;s ability to edit existing entries. It should be implemented with caution.</p>
  <p>When <span style="font-weight: bold;">Warning</span> is implemented, the user will be alerted when leaving a line lacking a Work Order Id but will be able to save the record.</p>
  <p>If <span style="font-weight: bold;">Neither</span> is implemented (or the registry option does not exist) the user will not be alerted if a Service Compute type Job lacks a Work Order reference.</p>
  <h5>Registry Setting by Journal to Require Work Order for Service Compute Job</h5>
  <p>The NeedWOInServiceComputeJobs option may also be set for a specific journal. If so, it will trump the global setting. For example, to use the Warning option globally, but the Neither option in the Job Journal (to simplify making corrections), the following registry entries would be made:</p>
  <p><span style="font-weight: bold;">Registry Id:</span> sys-ffv-global-settings</p>
  <p><span style="font-weight: bold;">Setting Key:</span> NeedWOInServiceComputeJobs  <span style="font-weight: bold;">Setting Value:</span> Warning</p>

  <h3>1.1.8 Login Processing - WebHelp</h3>
  <p>This release supports new logging to help support diagnose issues where WebHelp does not launch. If enabled via registry, the new DefaultHTML.log file will be updated on each login with the user, date and time and the .HTML path used display a html document. The Log file will be created in the SAMPro Base Directory if it does not exist.<br style="font-family: Verdana, &#39;Helvetica Neue&#39;, Helvetica, Arial, sans-serif;

  <h3>1.1.9 Fillable Forms - Do Not Auto-Display PDF</h3>
  <p>This release adds registry-enabled functionality to skip the auto display of the PDF version of fillable forms such as Lien Waiver Report Fillable (AR) report. If this registry is not in place, clicking the Fillable Form button to generate the formatted, PDF version of the report will open the PDF. If the following registry is in place, the PDF will be created but not opened.</p>

  <h3>1.1.10 View SQL Button Registry</h3>
  <p><img alt="" border="0" src="assets/images/SKIN1_ViewSQL.bmp" style="border: none;"/> The ViewSQL button is now generally available in SAMPro Record viewers. This button adds the ability to have custom add-in Special Query Results List Panes defined and called via stored procedures maintained in a user’s database.</p>
  <p style="margin-left: 48px;"><span style="font-weight: bold;">Note:</span> Utilizing this feature will generally be a decision made in coordination with Data-Basics representative to provide a rapid deployment solution alternative to a standard SAMPro programming modification request.</p>
  <p style="margin-left: 8px;">When enabled via registry in conjunction with a corresponding stored procedure added to the database, results list panes can be launched to present additional information about the selected record as per the definition of the stored procedure.</p>
  <p style="margin-left: 8px;">The 9.1.611.059 release refines the SQL output display when the ViewSQL button is clicked.  The SQL display window can now be resized so that columns are not cut off.</p>
  <p style="margin-left: 8px;">The following registry is presented as an of the example the settings needed to enable this. In this simple example, the View SQL button would ALL fields from a the work order header (select * from wrkordr). This example is presented for learning purposes.</p>
  <h5><b>Sample Registry to Enable View SQL button </b></h5>
  <p style="margin-left: 8px;"><b>Registry I</b><span style="font-weight: bold;">d:</span>  sys-sql-vwrkordr:WO List</p>
  <p style="margin-left: 8px;">The Id must reference the record the ViewSQL button is to be enabled. In the above example, this will be for the work order viewer. The text following the colon defines this specific entry (more than one View SQL entries may be defined for a viewer).</p>
  <p style="margin-left: 8px;"><span style="font-weight: bold;">Registry Name:</span> View SQL - Work Order</p>
  <p style="margin-left: 8px;"><span style="font-weight: bold;">Setting Key:</span> MenuTitle   <span style="font-weight: bold;">Setting Value:</span> WO List</p>
  <p style="margin-left: 8px;">This Setting defines the Menu Title that appears when the user clicks the button if more than one SQL function has been specified for this record.</p>
  <p style="margin-left: 8px;"><span style="font-weight: bold;">Setting Key:</span> ListTitle  <span style="font-weight: bold;">Setting Value:</span> WO List For: ^wo_id^</p>
  <p style="margin-left: 8px;">This setting provides title used in the report itself. Tokens appropriate to the stored procedure and record must be used. For the ListTitle registry the token set in the Setting Value field <u style="box-sizing: border-box;">must be lowercase</u>.</p>
  <p style="margin-left: 8px;"><span style="font-weight: bold;">Setting Key:</span> Token~wo_id  <span style="font-weight: bold;">Setting Value:</span> wrkordr.id</p>
  <p style="margin-left: 8px;">This setting defines the token passed to the stored procedure from the record. Lowercase values for tokens and field names should be used.</p>
  <p style="margin-left: 8px;"><span style="font-weight: bold;">Setting Key:</span> SQL  Setting Value: sp_WO_List ^wo_id^</p>
  <p style="margin-left: 8px;">The Setting Key specifies the procedure object (typically SQL). The Setting Value specifies the stored procedure object name followed by the appropriated token to be passed to it. Lowercase values for tokens should be used.</p>
  <p style="margin-left: 8px;"><span style="font-weight: bold;">Setting Key:</span> Error~wo_id  <span style="font-weight: bold;">Setting Value:</span> Work Order ID must be specified</p>
  <p style="margin-left: 8px;">The setting defines the error processing message the user does not (in this case) specify a Work Order Id.</p>
  <p style="margin-left: 8px;">The following is the stored procedure for that example:</p>
  <p style="margin-left: 48px;">CREATE PROCEDURE dbo.sp_WO_List</p>
  <p style="margin-left: 48px;">@wrkordr_id NVARCHAR(10)</p>
  <p style="margin-left: 48px;">AS</p>
  <p style="margin-left: 48px;">SELECT *</p>
  <p style="margin-left: 48px;">FROM wrkordr</p>
  <p style="margin-left: 48px;">WHERE wrkordr_id = @wrkordr_id</p>
  <h3>1.1.10 Change to AutoDocumentAfterChange Notes Option</h3>
  <p>The existing AutoDocumentAfterChange registry option may be enabled in viewer registries to automatically add a Note when a record is saved. In previous releases, these Notes were set to Public by default, resulting in them being uploaded to Service Channel when certain records were saved. In this release, the Notes default to Private when generated via this registry.</p>
  <p style="margin-left: 8px; font-weight: bold;">Id: <span style="font-weight: normal;">s</span><span style="text-indent: 30.25pt; font-weight: normal;">ys-viewer-<font style="font-style: italic; font-weight: normal;">vFunctionId  or sys-ffv-global-settings</font></span></p>

    <font style="font-weight: bold;">Setting Key:</font> AutoDocumentAfterChange <font style="font-weight: bold;">Setting Value:</font> true
  </p>
  <h3>1.1.11 Report Registry to Require Company Selection</h3>
  <p>When intercompany is enabled, the user is only required to select a Company if some sort of posting is generated when the user confirms that the report has printed correctly. This registry may be enabled to require that the user select a Company when printing a report that does not include a print confirmation. This may be enabled to ensure that the correct bitmap is used on the report or for some other reason.</p>
  <p style="font-weight: bold;">Registry Id: <span style="font-weight: normal;">sys-report-</span><span style="font-style: italic; font-weight: normal;">functionid</span></p>
  <p style="font-weight: bold;">Setting Key: <span style="font-weight: normal;">CompanySelectionRequired</span></p>
  <p style="font-weight: bold;">Setting Value: <span style="font-weight: normal;">true, t, y, yes, or intercompanyonly   (default is not enabled)</span></p>
  <p style="font-weight: bold;"><span style="font-weight: normal;">By default, this functionality is not enabled. The intercompanyonly key should only apply if the intercompany is enabled.</span></p>
  <p style="font-weight: bold;">WARNING: <span style="font-weight: normal;">This registry should NOT be applied to reports run via the Scheduled Report Manager.</span></p>
  <p style="margin-left: 48px; text-decoration: underline; ">Example: Require Company Selection for COP Order Acknowledgement</p>
  <p style="margin-left: 48px;">Id: sys-report-rordracknwldgmnt</p>

  <p style="margin-left: 48px;">Company/Security specific registries (e.g., sys-report-rordracknwldgmnt-securityid) must also be established to specify appropriate bitmaps.<span style="font-weight: bold;"> </span></p>
  <h3>1.1.12 Registry to Improve the Loading Speed of SQL Results </h3>
  <p>This registry improves the loading speed when processing SQL results.</p>
  <p><strong>Id:</strong> sys-ffv-global-settings</p>
  <p><strong>Setting Key:</strong> MaxCharacterCountToCompress    <strong>Setting Value:</strong> 50000000</p>
  <h2>1.2 User Viewer</h2>
  <h3>1.2.1 New Tab: Other</h3>
  <p><span style="font-weight: bold;">User Security 1-3:</span><br/>
    These fields are designed for use with certain custom analytics. They are not currently referenced by the SAMPro code.</p>
  <h3>1.2.2 New Tab - Apps</h3>
  <p><span style="font-weight: bold;">App Name: Last Session Id:</span><br/>
    Reserved for Future Use.</p>
  <h3>1.2.3 Main Tab</h3>
  <p style="font-weight: bold;">Import / Export Profile Buttons</p>
  <p>This release corrects a Key Is Missing error when importing certain older analytics with a missing query name.  </p>
  <h2>1.3 Reports</h2>
  <h3>1.3.1 Start Report Import</h3>
  <p>When a new report is added to your database, the system automatically creates a new User Defined Function for it so that it can be assigned to the appropriate User Groups. This process was not always reliable in previous versions.</p>
  <h3>1.3.2 Global Registry to Enable Windows Printer Dialog</h3>
  <p><span style="font-weight: bold;">Id:</span> sys-ffv-global-settings</p>
  <p><span style="font-weight: bold;">Setting Key:</span> OldPrinterDialog    <span style="font-weight: bold;">Setting Value:</span> true    (default false)</p>
  <p>Enabling this setting will display the Windows (OldPrinterDialog) screen instead of SAMPro&#39;s Printer List when printing a report. This allows the use to select a different paper tray and other functions not supported on the SAMPro printer list.</p>
  <p>This may be disabled on a function by function basis by the following:</p>
  <p><span style="font-weight: bold;">Id:</span> sys-printer-dialog-<span style="font-style: italic;">funtionid</span></p>
  <p><span style="font-weight: bold;">Setting Key:</span> olddialog   <span style="font-weight: bold;">Setting Value:</span> false</p>
  <p>The system handles existing local report registry oldDialog=&#39;&#39; as oldDialog = true to preserve old-style registry settings turning on this functionality.</p>
  <p style="margin-left: 48px;">Note:<br/>
    When OldPrinterDialog/Olddialog is enabled, the From - To Pages settings in the Report viewer are NOT carried to the Second Windows printer box where it must be set. To print only a few pages of a report, the page number must be entered in the Windows Dialog.</p>
  <h3>1.3.3 Generic Text Printer Files: Start Move Generic Documents  </h3>
  <p>Some users &#39;print&#39; to a generic text printer; this may generate a file with NO FILENAME EXTENSION instead of paper. In some cases, the file is written to the directory containing the SAMPro executable which clutters up the folder. <span style="font-weight: bold;">In this function, &#39;generic document&#39; refers to these files, not SAMPro Document records. In this function, &#39;generic document&#39; refers to these files, not SAMPro Document records.</span></p>
  <p>If the following registry entry exists, this new function will move all files with no filename extension from the SAMPro base directory to the Destination Directory specified in the registry. If this registry does not exist, running the function will have no impact on your files. This function is designed to be run &#39;headless&#39; so that it can be scheduled to run as a scheduled event.</p>
  <p>If there is an exception list of files in the registry these files will not be moved. If the file already exists in the Destination Directory then a count will be added to the file name before it is stored. Special Characters in File names will be replaced by Underscore before the file is moved.</p>
  <p><span style="font-weight: bold;">Id:</span> sys-start-smvegnrcdcmnts</p>
  <h5><span style="font-weight: bold;">Specify the Destination Directory</span></h5>
  <p><span style="font-weight: bold;">Setting Key:</span> DestinationDirectory   <span style="font-weight: bold;">Setting Value:</span> <span style="font-style: italic;">PathToDestinationDirectory</span></p>
  <p><span style="font-style: italic;">The Setting Value should provide the full path of an existing directory.</span> Start Move Generic Documents will move files with no Filename Extension from the base SAMPro directory to the folder defined in this option.</p>
  <h5><span style="font-weight: bold;">Specify Files to Excluded from the Move (required)</span></h5>
  <p><span style="font-weight: bold;">Setting Key:</span> FileExceptions   <strong>Setting Value:</strong> <span style="font-style: italic;">ListOfFilesToIgnore</span></p>
  <p>Some files with no filename extension are used by SAMPro and should be excluded from the move. At this point, LabelRemap and inetlog should be excluded. It is possible that others should also be excluded.</p>
  <p style="margin-left: 48px;">Example:</p>
  <p style="margin-left: 48px;"><span style="font-weight: bold;">Setting Key:</span> FileExceptions   <span style="font-weight: bold;">Setting Value:</span> LabelRemap,inetlog</p>

  <h3>1.3.4 Report Scheduling Enhancement</h3>
  <p>Previously, when scheduling the DGLHSTRY report and including single quotes in the text in the range field, it would result in an error. The DGLHSTRY reports can run correctly when single quotes are used in the range fields. This update corrects this defect. </p>
  <p>Previously, if a new version of a currently scheduled report was installed, a System Primitive error was generated if the report included a new Button field that would appear on the report. In this release, the software will display the text &quot;Unknown&quot; for the value of the missing field instead of crashing the report manager. The report should be manually rescheduled so that it will be generated with the new report parameters.</p>
  <p>The Day and Time Repeat Options validation is also performed when the GO button is clicked: previously validation was only performed when the OK button was clicked on the Schedule Report Pane.</p>
  <p>In previous releases, there was not a way to edit the settings made when users schedule a Report Anywhere report. Users have to delete the scheduled report and then re-schedule it from scratch. In this release, the system allows users to easily update, copy or cancel a scheduled report. To do so:</p>
  <p>Assess the scheduled report to change and select the Schedule Report option in the upper left-hand pane. The following new fields will be displayed:</p>
  <p><span style="font-weight: bold;">Event Id:</span><br/>
    Double-click on the Event Id. This field allows users to select from the list of existing Scheduled Events for this report. Select the Schedule Event for this report to be changed.</p>
  <p><span style="font-weight: bold;">Process Type:</span><br/>
    This field allows users to select what they want to change to the selected Event when the OK button is pressed. The 3 choices are:</p>
  <p><span style="font-weight: bold;">Create Only</span> -This will create a new Scheduled Event; the currently selected Event will not be modified.</p>
  <p><span style="font-weight: bold;">Create/Cancel</span> - This will create a new Scheduled Event and remove the selected Schedule Event selected in the Event Id field.</p>
  <p><span style="font-weight: bold;">Update</span> - This option will update the selected Scheduled Event.</p>
  <p>When OK is pressed on the Scheduled Report screen, the fields on the Scheduled Event screen will be validated and the Report Range screen displayed. Make any needed changes to any of the Range or other input field. When the report options correctly configured for the new/revised event, click GO. Doing so will create/remove/update the scheduled event table based on the process type.</p>
  <h3>1.3.4a Schedule Report Enhancement - Recent Update</h3>
  <p>A scheduled report may be edited by selecting it&#39;s Event Id.  This release corrects an issue where the value set in the report&#39;s Date fields via the right click Repeat Date Strategy was not retained when the report was edited or copied.</p>
  <p>This release corrects the problem with Report Trial Balance (a landscape-oriented system report) being emailed/saved as a portrait when run as a Scheduled Report. This fix prevents an orientation override for non-User Reports. </p>
  <h3>1.3.5 Reprinting Reports</h3>
  <p>This release refines the functionality used to reprint a DBR report where the server with the original bitmaps was changed (a problem if mapped drivers were NOT specified). In this release, when the original bitmap location no longer exists and the system checks the \bitmaps folder of the SAMPro base directory, and supports  bitmap overrides (BitmapOverrideBasedOn=branch) as long as a bitmap= option is NOT in the report registry. However, if the bitmap= option is active, it overrides the override.</p>
  <h3>1.3.6 Start Report Import</h3>
  <p>SAMPro&#39;s User Defined Reports share field definitions. Importing an older report (with a smaller field size) will reduce the field size for all reports that use it in the database; this can result in other reports throwing errors. In this release, the user is alerted when a field being imported is smaller than that found in the database (unless the global registry setting ReportImportReportFields=Keep is enabled).</p>
  <p>Field size comparisons are calculated as follows:</p>
  <p>Decimal fields (Precision - Scale) for both fields<br style="color: #000000; 
														 font-family: Verdana, &#39;Helvetica Neue&#39;, Helvetica, Arial, sans-serif; 
														 font-size: 14px; 
														 font-style: normal; 
														 font-variant-ligatures: normal; 
														 font-variant-caps: normal; 
														 font-weight: 400; 
														 letter-spacing: normal; 
														 orphans: 2; text-align: start; 
														 text-indent: 0px; 
														 text-transform: none; 
														 white-space: normal; 
														 widows: 2; word-spacing: 0px; 
														 -webkit-text-stroke-width: 0px; 
														 text-decoration-style: initial; 
														 text-decoration-color: initial;"/>
    Textbox fields (Precision * Scale) for both fields<br style="margin-bottom: 0px; 
														 color: #000000; 
														 font-family: Verdana, &#39;Helvetica Neue&#39;, Helvetica, Arial, sans-serif; 
														 font-size: 14px; 
														 font-style: normal; 
														 font-variant-ligatures: normal; 
														 font-variant-caps: normal; 
														 font-weight: 400; 
														 letter-spacing: normal; 
														 orphans: 2; text-align: start; 
														 text-indent: 0px; 
														 text-transform: none; 
														 white-space: normal; 
														 widows: 2; word-spacing: 0px; 
														 -webkit-text-stroke-width: 0px; 
														 text-decoration-style: initial; 
														 text-decoration-color: initial;"/>
    All other types of fields compare only the Precision.</p>
  <p>If the report field definition being imported is smaller that the corresponding report field in the database, the following message will be displayed:</p>
  <p style="margin-left: 48px;">The Field Id: xxxxx now in your database for Report: yyyyyyy</p>
  <p style="margin-left: 48px;">has Field Size: 15 greater than the report you are importing with Field Size: 10</p>
  <p style="margin-left: 48px;">Do you want to import the smaller field  (not recommended)?</p>
  <p>We recommend selecting &#39;No&#39; if this message appears.  Please take a screen capture of this message if it appears, and contact Support with this information so that the problem with the report can be corrected.</p>
  <h3>1.3.7 Report Input Screens</h3>
  <p>This release extends the Custom Fields (right-click) relabel functionality implemented in record viewers to also display on report input screens. For example, if &#39;Client Id&#39; is changed to &#39;Customer#&#39; in the Client viewer, report ranges previously labeled &#39;Client Id&#39; will now be labeled &#39;Customer#&#39;. Note that this enhancement is for the &#39;user&#39; reports obtained from Data-Basics and applies to the report input fields, not the text in the report itself.</p>
  <h3>1.3.8 Fillable Forms Reports - Registry to Prevent Auto-Open</h3>
  <p>This release adds registry-enabled functionality to skip the auto display of the PDF version of fillable forms such as Lien Waiver Report Fillable (AR) report. If this registry is not in place, clicking the Fillable Form  button to generate the formatted, PDF version of the report will open the PDF. If the following registry is in place his, the PDF will be created but not opened.</p>
  <p><span style="font-weight: bold;">Registry Id:</span> sys-report-<span style="font-style: italic;">reportfunctionid</span></p>
  <p><span style="font-weight: bold;">Setting Key:</span><span style="font-weight: normal;"> showdocumentfillableform   </span><span style="font-weight: bold;">Setting Value:</span><span style="font-weight: normal;"> false (default true)</span></p>
  <h3>1.3.9 Crystal Reports</h3>
  <p>This release corrects a recent problem where the Crystal Viewer Web did not launch correctly if Chrome as the default web browser.</p>
  <h3>1.3.10 Word Wrap on User Defined Reports</h3>
  <p>This release corrects a sporadic issue where the word wrap on report textbox fields would split a word at the end of a line incorrectly instead of wrapping it. This issue was noticed on the Service Invoice and Service Worksheet but would have been present in other reports. Note: In certain cases, it may be necessary to use the textboxwidth report registry to obtain the desired results.</p>
  <h3>1.3.11 General Reports</h3>
  <p>This update adds an indicator in the title bar when a cached report is in use.</p>
  <p>In 9.1.611.060 and up,his update saves pre-compile report definitions to reduce the load time of any report, including the service invoice report.</p>
  <p style="margin-left: 34px;"><strong>Id:</strong> sys-behavior-reports <strong>Setting Key:</strong> UseCompiledReport         <strong> Setting Value:</strong> true</p>
  <p style="margin-left: 34px;"><b>Note: This registry is important for performance improvement for every report. Contact your Data Basics Support member for more details. </b></p>
  <p>This update allows the message box to automatically close after running reports. User can click “Yes” on the message box to close it before it automatically closes. <br/>
    <strong>Note: This registry is vital for efficiency.</strong><br/>
    <strong style="margin-left: 28px">Id: </strong>sys-messagebox
  </p>
  <p><strong style="margin-left: 28px">Setting Key:</strong> ReportPrintConfirmationTimeout    <strong>Setting Value:</strong> 30 Seconds (0 default)</p>
  <p>When searching terms on a report, the select search terms font color is now a darker green, for better readability.</p>
  <h2>1.4 Start Archive Record Change Log</h2>
  <p>In 9.1.611.061 and up, this update improves performance when using the Archive Record Change Log function by executing deletes in batches.</p>
  <p>This function improves performance when accessing records in SAMPro. Internal changes in Version 9.1.611.056 support the synchronization of the Record Change Log and Archive tables to allow this function to run successfully. The user will be asked to confirm the table changes if this function is run manually. Errors will be reported if manual intervention is needed to support archiving; contact your Support Rep if this occurs. This fix is only supported for MS SQL databases. Corrects a problem that prevented this function from running in recent versions.</p>
  <h2>1.5 Document Management</h2>
  <p>Internal changes in this release improve performance by Document Archiving and TechAnywhere document posting when folders contain a very large number of files.</p>
  <p style="margin-left: 8px;">This release corrects a timing issue where SAMPro would attempt to create an archive before the original document is done being scanned/saved. This could result in a 0KB archive file being created. </p>
  <p style="margin-left: 8px;">This release corrects a sporadic &#39;Runtime error: index: 1 is outside of collection bounds&#39; which showed up in Windows 10 (fresh install) when trying to show an image in a Document record.</p>
  <h3>1.5.1 Scanning</h3>
  <p>Using Attach&gt;Scan now logs the User Id in addition to the date and time.</p>
  <h3>1.5.2 Start Document Archive Maintenance</h3>
  <p>Start Document Archive Maintenance&#39;s option to convert DBR&#39;s to PDF&#39;s generated PDF&#39;d PO&#39;s as portrait instead of landscape in previous releases. The correct orientation is now maintained when a report is converted to PDF.</p>
  <p>When Force Archive and Convert to PDF are both flagged, the archived .dbr file is now converted to a PDF. Previously, the file extension was changed but the file remained in .dbr format.</p>
  <p>The DBR to PDF function now uses the report&#39;s internal bitmap path to set the pdf graphics if available.</p>
  <p>This function now puts convertedDBRs in the root of the document\archive\convertedDBRs with subfoldering (YYYY-MM) if it is enabled.</p>
  <p><span style="font-weight: bold;">New Field: Days Past to Check PDF Archives</span><br/>
    This field controls a new purchase which has been added to this function to look for documents which failed to be converted from XML to PDF&#39;s; if any are found, the system will convert them to PDF&#39;s.  </p>
  <p>When this function is run, the system subtracts the NumberOfPastDaysToCheckPDFArchives in the registry from today&#39;s date to check all documents created <span style="font-style: italic;">after</span> that date; if the archive file is a PDF file then it checks if it exists. If it doesn&#39;t then it checks if there is an XML document for that archive, and if there is it converts it to the PDF Archive.</p>
  <p>By default, this field is set to 7: documents created within the last 7 days will be checked to see if  they need to be converted to PDF&#39;s.  If this field is set to 0, no Documents will be checked to set if they are XML files which need to be converted to PDF.  The following registry allows the default value of the Days Past to Check PDF Archives field to be adjusted.</p>
  <h5>1.5.2a Registry Entry to Provide Default Days Past to Check PDF Archives</h5>
  <p><span style="font-weight: bold;">Id</span>: sys-start-sdcmntarchvemntnnce</p>
  <p><span style="font-weight: bold;">Setting Key:</span> NumberOfPastDaysToCheckPDFArchives   <span style="font-weight: bold;">Setting Value:</span> <span style="font-style: italic;">numberofdays</span> (default is 7)</p>
  <p>This registry entry provides the default value for this field for the manual Start Document Archive Maintenance function and the Start Document Archive Maintenance (Automated) function.</p>
  <h3>1.5.3 Document Viewer</h3>
  <p>Multi-file Document records allow the user to view the files combined into a single PDF, generating a UserId_ViewDocument.pdf in SAMPro&#39;s base directory. This file is deleted when the user logs off for security reasons and to cleanup these extraneous files.</p>
  <p><span style="font-weight: bold;">File Location:</span><br/>
    Some users employ the Document Viewer to store web addresses instead of actual files. The File Location validation applied in earlier releases now ignores the location validation if the Location field begins with &#39;http://&#39;, &#39;https://&#39; or &quot;www.&#39;.</p>
  <p>If a web address is stored in the File Location field, clicking the View Document button launches a web browser pointing to the web address.</p>
  <p><strong>Document Viewer Download Button:</strong></p>
  <p>This update provides a download button to the document viewer. </p>
  <p><strong>Field:</strong> push-saveDocument</p>
  <h3>1.5.3a Document Viewer</h3>
  <p style="font-weight: bold;">Web Viewable  FM - Web Viewable CRM - Web Viewable Tech<br/>
    <span style="font-weight: normal;">Documents uploaded from the web products (DBAnalytics, FMAnywhere, CRM, Dispatch Board) that use the &#39;Start Dashboard Post&#39; or &#39;Start NetFramework Post&#39; functions, now have their appropriate web viewable flags set.</span> 
  </p>
  <h3>1.5.4 Correcting PO&#39;s Saved as Portrait PDF&#39;s</h3>
  <p style="margin-left: 8px;">In previous releases, if the global registry option UseConvertedDBRs was set to true, landscape PO&#39;s that were archived as PDF&#39;s using this functionality were erroneously generated in portrait format. This release corrects this problem.</p>
  <p style="margin-left: 8px;">To correct previously auto-saved PO PDF&#39;s</p>
  <p style="margin-left: 48px;">Access the Purchase Order or Print PO Form</p>
  <p style="margin-left: 48px;">Start the Print PO process to display the report (but do not actually print it),</p>
  <p style="margin-left: 48px;">If your PO&#39;s are set to autosave, this procedure will resave the PO DBReport and regenerate the PDF correctly.</p>
  <h3>1.5.5 Quick Attach</h3>
  <p>Quick Attach documents may now be attached to &#39;locked&#39; journal entries (both the Add and Save button disabled). QA documents are attached immediately when the record is NOT in Add mode.</p>
  <p style="margin-left: 8px;">This release provides a performance enhancement that will be especially noticeable if the save path has many files. In addition, the user will be warned if the Quick Attach Save path does not exists, and will not be allowed to continue. If the Quick Attach New path does not exist, the browser windows will be opened to the SAMPro root directory, and the user will be allowed to continue.</p>
  <p style="margin-left: 8px;">In version 9.1.611.059 and up, the quick attach cancel alert changed to “file selection was cancelled. Please click OK to continue.” Previously, it said “file selection was cancelled. Please click Yes to continue.” The button said OK.  </p>
  <h3>1.5.6 Canadian Date Formats</h3>
  <p style="margin-left: 8px;"><span>This release supports short-format Canadian dates (yyyy-MM-dd) when creating/using YYYY-MM subfolders generated by: Document Archive Maintenance, Quick Attach, Dashboard Post, Netframework Post, TechAnywhere Post, and Project Manager Workbench (RFI, RFQ, Transmittal, Submittal, Other. </span></p>
  <h3>1.5.7 Saving Report Files</h3>
  <p>This release improves the performance of saving report files; this should be especially noticeable if a large number of files already exist in the directory the file will be saved in.</p>
  <h2>1.6 Email</h2>
  <h3>1.6.1 <span style="font-weight: bold;">Emailing Reports</span></h3>
  <p>SAMPro&#39;s Email form supports an expanded Message field of 1200 characters to allow the entire contents of a Common phase to be included in the Message.</p>
  <p>This update allows users who have selected the Use Java Mailer? option to send email tests with commas included in the text. Before, if a user had Use Java Mailer? selected and included a comma in the text, an error message would appear. </p>
  <p>In 9.1.611.060b and up, this update corrects a defect where the spacing and other formatting changes made the email content look warped. This only happened when common phrases were referenced in the email. </p>
  <h3>1.6.2 Use Outlook Enhancements</h3>
  <p>When UseOutlook is enabled in the sys-email registry, this release handles setting the &#39;To&#39; field for multiple addresses. For example, when emailing from the Collection viewer, the Client&#39;s Collections Email containing 0, 1, or 2 addresses (delimited with a comma or a semi-colon) will be inserted in the Outlook form&#39;s Email To field.</p>
  <p>This release also supports setting Outlook&#39;s email &#39;To&#39; field as well as defaulting pdf&#39;d attachments The revised xmlToPdf.jar file (dated 12017/12/29 or later) is also required.</p>
  <h3>1.6.3 CopyAll Registry</h3>
  <p>This release corrects an issue where using the CopyAll registry setting in sys-email resulted in a duplicate email if the email came from an escalation event.</p>
  <h3>1.6.4 New XMLToPDF Files</h3>
  <h5>Corrects Email Address / Subject Concatenation Issue from Client Collections</h5>
  <p>The revised XmlToPdf[2021-05-21 Java8-11].jar file corrects an issue in Outlook 2016. The &quot;Collections Email Address&quot; was having the &quot;Collections Email Subject&quot; concatenated when emailing an invoice from the Client Collections screen. This file must be renamed as XmlToPdf.jar in order for it to be used. This version supports TLS 1.2 and uses Javamail 1.6.2. Java 7 is not supported.</p>
  <h5>Support TLS 1.2 and Uses Javamail 1.6.2</h5>
  <p style="margin-left: 8px;">A new version of the XML to PDF file is included as XmlToPdf[2019-04-05 Java 8-11].jar.  In addition to the features described in the version from 2019-01-16, this version:</p>
  <p style="margin-left: 88px;">Specifies the use of TLS 1.2 (a newer protocol) for emailing<br/>
    Changes how XmlToPdf connects to email servers<br/>
    Updates Javamail to 1.6.2</p>
  <p style="margin-left: 8px;">This file must be renamed as XmlToPdf.jar in order for it to be used. It does not support Java 7.</p>
  <h5>Supports Java 8-11, Monthly Folders and Registry to Retain Sent Files</h5>
  <p style="margin-left: 8px;">XmlToPdf[2019-01-16 Java8-11].jar</p>
  <p style="margin-left: 8px;">This file must be renamed as XmlToPdf.jar in order to be used. This version of the XmlToPdf.jar file supports Java 8-11. It should NOT be installed if Java 7 users will be sending emails from SAMPro.  It also creates Monthly folders in the XmlToPDFSent folder (YYYY-MM format) to store all the sent pdfs (and XML and log files, if enabled via registry) from a particular month.   </p>
  <p style="margin-left: 8px;">This version of the file also corrects the following which existed in the previous Java 8-11 files:</p>
  <p style="margin-left: 48px;">Email Retry files would fail to include the pdf and leave it in the retry folder.</p>
  <p style="margin-left: 48px;">Single report (no attachments, one section) Password-protected PDFs were not properly applying a password.</p>
  <h5>1.6.4a Change to Registry When Using this XmlToPdf[2019-01-03 Java8-11] or Above</h5>
  <p style="margin-left: 8px;">The functionality of the -d and -v flags (enabled via the global appflagsxmltopdf) has been altered for XmlToPdf[2019-01-03 Java8-11] and above. Previously, the -d flag just deleted the log and xml file. That was changed to include the pdf also at some point. This version makes the -d flag only delete the XML file. The PDF file is now always preserved. The log file is now deleted by default. Adding the -v flag will preserve the log.</p>
  <p style="margin-left: 8px;"><span style="font-weight: bold;">Registry Id:</span> sys-ffv-global-settings</p>
  <p style="margin-left: 8px;"><span style="font-weight: bold;">Setting Key:</span> appflagsxmltopdf</p>
  <p style="margin-left: 8px;"><span style="font-weight: bold;">Setting Value:</span> -d</p>
  <p style="margin-left: 8px;">This value retains the PDF files only. This is the default setting if this registry option appflagsxmltopdf is NOT enabled.</p>
  <p style="margin-left: 8px;"><span style="font-weight: bold;">Setting Value:</span>-v</p>
  <p style="margin-left: 8px;">If the Setting Value is set to -v the log, XML, and PDF files (if present) will be retained in the base XmlToPDF_Sent folder.</p>
  <p style="margin-left: 48px;">If the MailerMethod is set to Java in the sys-email registry, running with the -v flag set also retains the XML and log files of emails sent without an attachment. This allows the XML record of scheduled event emails to be retained.</p>
  <p style="margin-left: 48px;">Note: The log files of emails with PDF attached can be quite large, so the monthly folders should be cleared out on a regular basis.</p>
  <p style="margin-left: 8px;"><span style="font-weight: bold;">Setting Value:</span> -d -v</p>
  <p style="margin-left: 8px;">This retains the pdf and log files but not the XML files. If the MailerMethod is set to Java in the sys-email registry, running with the -v and -v flags set also retains the log files of emails sent without an attachment. This allows a log of scheduled event emails and emailed reports to be retained.</p>
  <h3>1.6.4b Installations with some Java 7 Users</h3>
  <p style="margin-left: 8px;">Installations with some Java 7 users should rename the XmlToPdf[2017-12-27].jar XmlToPdf.jar in order for it to be used. This file supports the revised W-2 reporting format. It also corrects a file &#39;cannot find this file&#39; error with UseOutlook enabled for Outlook 2013 and below. This version support Java 7 and 8.</p>
  <h3><span style="font-weight: bold;">1.6.5 Java Detection</span></h3>
  <p>When trying to call XMLtoPDF when Java is not installed, previous versions of SAMPro reported the error &quot;Runtime error: OS Error: The system cannot find the file specified.&quot;  The system will now detect when Java not installed before launching Xml-to-Pdf java program and display the following error instead:</p>
  <p style="margin-left: 88px;">ERROR:<br/>
    You do not have access to the Java runtime.<br/>
    See your system administrator.</p>
  <h3>1.6.6 Revised XMLtoPDF to Correct UseOutlook Issue</h3>
  <p>Revised XmlToPdf.jar file for Java 8-11: TLS 1.2 and Uses Javamail 1.6.2 (no default file; must rename):</p>
  <p>The XmlToPdf[2021-07-26 Java8-11].jar file corrects and causes SAMPro to hang until Outlook is closed under the following condition:</p>
  <p style="margin-left: 48px;">Registry Set to Use Outlook: (Registry Id: sys-email   Setting Key: UseOutlook   Setting Value: True)</p>
  <p style="margin-left: 48px;">Clicking an E-Mail button in SAMPro if Outlook is not currently open/running</p>
  <h3>1.6.7 Provide Support for Image/Logo in Emails</h3>
  
  
  
  
  
  
  <p></p>
  <h3><strong>Scheduled Event Escalation Emails are not Sent with EmailHeaderImage or EmailFooterImage Registries set</strong></h3>
  <p><strong></strong>In the above case, scheduled event escalation emails were not being sent out when a SAMPro environment used the SAMPro emailer instead of XMLtoPDF.jar. This update corrects that defect. <strong>Id:</strong> sys-emailHeaderImage-escalation</p>
  <p><strong>Setting Key:</strong> Escalation Profile Id    <strong>Setting Value: </strong>(path to the image)</p>
  <p><strong>Example:</strong> <em>https://www.databasics.com/images/email/header.png</em></p>
  <p><em></em><strong>Id:</strong> sys-emailFooterImage-escalation</p>
  <p><strong>Setting Key:</strong> Escalation Profile Id      <strong> Setting Value:</strong> (path to the image)</p>
  <p><strong>Example:</strong> <em>https://www.databasics.com/images/email/footer.png</em></p>
  <p><strong>Note: The path to the image must be accessible via the web, otherwise, the image will not appear in the email for the recipient.</strong></p>
  <h3>1.7 Login Processing</h3>
  <p style="margin-left: 8px;">Switching Security from the File&gt;Switch Security Id menu no longer terminates the User&#39;s Web sessions.</p>
  <p style="margin-left: 8px;">For SQL Server database users, SAMPro will check for database table change rights and uncommitted transactions to ensure a successful database conversion.</p>
  <p style="margin-left: 8px;">Corrects a &#39;failed to set read permissions for user&#39; error logging into SAMPro with an SQL 2008 database.</p>
  <p style="margin-left: 8px;">See Customer Note 1.1.1 for a registry to limit software expiration warnings to specific Users/User Groups.</p>
  <p style="margin-left: 8px;"> </p>
  <h3>1.7.1 Test for Intercompany Settings on Login</h3>
  <p>Data-related issues can occur if an Intercompany installation runs with a non-Interco v.cus and vice versa. In this version, the system will display a warning upon login if the v.cus file and global registry intercompanyenabled=true don&#39;t match.  &#39;Special&#39; users will not see the warning to avoid issues with agent-type users started via batch file.</p>
  <p style="margin-left: 48px;"><span style="font-weight: bold;">WARNING:</span> The Inter Company settings on your v.cus and global registry do not match. Please contact your support representative for assistance.</p>
  <h3>1.7.2  Enhanced Login Processing</h3>
  <p>The following three enhancements have been made to the SAMPro Login process in this release:</p>
  <p style="margin-left: 48px;">WHEN the Id is valid AND the Password is valid AND the user&#39;s Failed Login Limit is exceeded</p>
  <p style="margin-left: 88px;">THEN the &#39;User Account has too many Failed Logins&#39; error is issued instead of the &#39;Invalid User Id and/or Password&#39; error.</p>
  <p style="margin-left: 48px;">WHEN the Id is valid AND but Password is invalid AND the user&#39;s Failed Login Limit is exceeded</p>
  <p style="margin-left: 88px;">THEN also, the &#39;User Account has too many Failed Logins&#39; error is issued instead of the &#39;Invalid User Id and/or Password&#39; error. This is the procedure employed by many websites.</p>
  <p style="margin-left: 48px;">WHEN the Id is valid AND the Password is valid AND the Logon process has been successfully completed</p>
  <p style="margin-left: 88px;">THEN the user&#39;s Failed Logon Count is reset to zero. Otherwise, the Failed Logon Count will remain in effect for all future login attempts.</p>
  <p>This is implemated in 9.1.611.059 and up: In previous releases, the following registry setting was enabled to allow users to display a message allowing users to log on back onto SAMPro immediately after logging off, perhaps as a different user.  However, this registry was not working as intended, and was launching the incorrect SAMPro image from the v.exe file rather than via the startme:</p>
  <p><span style="font-weight:bold;">Id:</span> sys-ffv-global-settings <span style="font-weight:bold;">Setting Key:</span> IsOkToLogonAgain <span style="font-weight:bold;">Setting Value:</span> true</p>
  <p>Rather than implement a fix, the functionality was deemed unnecessary and this registry has been deprecated and removed from having any functionality.</p>
  <h2>1.8 <span style="font-weight: bold;">Events Managers</span></h2>
  <p style="margin-left: 8px;">The Dashboard, Point Of Sale, Reports, Scheduled Events and TechAnywhere Events Managers have been refined to better handle recurring events that have been interrupted and need re-scheduled.</p>
  <h2>1.9 Viewers</h2>
  <p>This update corrects a defect with the code when a specific user would clone an employee, a technician, or a client site record, entering a new Id and clicking “Add” would not copy fields, as it did for other users. In addition, a previous defect from a previous case where unintended issues in the Approval Wizard as well as the Service Channel integration impacted all viewers. This update corrects this defect to only impact Cloning records.</p>
  <p>Previously, the SAMPro session run by customers using the AlwaysUp service would not fully close down because it gets hung up on the message box &quot;Are you sure you want to exit?&quot; AlwaysUp did not know what to do, so it waits and then ultimately has to forcibly end the task, leaving an orphaned active lgnhstry entry, and other issues like timeout alarms not being canceled. This update eliminates the &quot;Are you sure you want to exit?&quot; message box for certain users so that SAMPro just exits when the exit button is pressed.</p>
  <p>Previously, the entry in the ranges table would not create when a new user attempted to open the WO viewer. Also, when a user opened a Work Order through another viewer, then cleared the filter for the specific Work Order in Find Data, and then clicked on List, it would generate the record. This update improves the work order viewer’s performance for new users and corrects these defects.</p>
  <p>Previously when a user would clone an employee, a technician, or a client site record, entering a new Id and clicking “Add” would not copy fields. This update corrects this defect. </p>
  <p>This update corrects a defect with the code when a specific user would clone an employee, a technician, or a client site record, entering a new Id and clicking “Add” would not copy fields, as it did for other users. Previously, a defect from a previous case where unintended issues in the Approval Wizard as well as the Service Channel integration impacted all viewers. This update corrects this defect to only impact Cloning records.</p>
  <p>Previously when loading SQL results into memory, there would be a lot of data to load resulting in slow processing. This registry improves the loading speed when processing SQL results.</p>
  <p>This update corrects a defect preventing users from being able to use the &quot;Copy Quote Scope&quot; functionality on all new and existing Quotes, throwing an error when a user clicked the Copy Quote Scope button.</p>
  <p>This release revises the Warning message that when you leave a record that has changes that have not yet been saved.</p>
  <p style="margin-left: 48px;">WARNING: you have not saved all the changes you made to record &#39;&#39;xxx&#39;&#39;,</p>
  <p style="margin-left: 48px;">Click &#39;&#39;Yes&#39;&#39; to return to record &#39;&#39;xxx&#39;&#39; so you can save the changes.</p>
  <p style="margin-left: 48px;">Click &#39;&#39;No&#39;&#39; to continue without saving the changes.</p>
  <p>This release corrects sporadic errors encountered when clicking the End key and then editing an Id field that already contains the maximum number of characters. In order to prevent any loss of data, it is necessary to save all changes before changing the Id (implemented in Version 9.1.611.050). Unfortunately, this resulted in the user sometimes being stuck in a loop when they clicked Yes to save changes and return to the original record. This has been corrected in Version 9.1.611.053. The &#39;No&#39; path also works correctly and takes the user to the new record without saving changes.  </p>
  <h3>1.9.1 Id Lookup Lists</h3>
  <p style="margin-left: 8px;">This release provides improved performance when an Id-lookup list is initially opened (by double-clicking on an Id field or clicking the Lookup button <img alt="" border="0" src="assets/images/image/IdSearch.gif" style="border: none;"/>) and also when the user selects a different sort order in an Id-lookup list.</p>
  <h3><span style="font-weight: bold;">1.9.2  Viewer Status Pane</span></h3>
  <p style="margin-left: 8px;">The Status Pane (the bar at the bottom of SAMPro record windows) now displays the value of the field that the mouse is hovering over. This enhancement enables the user to view the contents of fields (such as the Job Cost Code Id) that are not fully displayed in the data-entry screen. Note: When the Status Pane displays the &#39;in focus&#39; field that changes to that field will not be displayed on the Status Pane until the user has tabbed out of it.</p>
  <h3>1.9.3  List  Pane Column Filtering Enhancement</h3>
  <p>On list panes, users can now right-click on column titles to apply filters to the column. This includes both record lists and lists displayed via child and parent tabs. On record lists, this saves users the trouble of going back and forth to the range screen to do the user&#39;s  filtering.</p>
  <p>* To filter a column, right-click on the column title and enter the filter on the subsequent popup.</p>
  <p class="Support" style="margin-left: 8px;"><img alt="" border="0" height="183" src="assets/images/filterpopup.jpg" style="border: none;" width="585"/></p>
  <p>* The list will be redisplayed with the filter applied. The column title will be displayed with the column title and text colors reverses to indicate that a filter on the column is being applied.</p>
  <p class="Support" style="margin-left: 8px;"> <img alt="" border="0" height="323" src="assets/images/filterstatuspane.jpg" style="border: none;" width="622"/></p>
  <p class="Support" style="margin-left: 48px;"> </p>
  <p>The new list pane filtering functionality is very similar to filtering users are used to in range screens and DBAnalytics. The following documentation provides details and examples on using the list pane filtering.</p>
  <p>* Filters may be applied to multiple columns.</p>
  <p>* To remove a filter, enter a blank filter in the popup.</p>
  <p>* To apply a blank filter, enter a filter value of ‘=’ in the popup.</p>
  <p>* After a filter is applied, the list will always revert to its original sort order.</p>
  <p>* Filters on numeric columns will use numeric comparison operators. Case insensitive String comparison operators will be used on all other columns. This means that for numeric column (but not a String column), a filter of ‘5000’ will match a column value of ‘5,000.00’. A column is deemed numeric if</p>
  <p style="margin-left: 48px;">o All its contents in the list are numeric</p>
  <p style="margin-left: 48px;">o And the entered filter is also numeric.</p>
  <p style="margin-left: 8px;">The filter format is similar to that used by the ‘Find Data’ button  The filter consists of one or more ‘or clauses’ separated by commas.</p>
  <p style="margin-left: 8px;">Each ‘or clause’ can be in one of these two formats:</p>
  <p style="margin-left: 48px;">? &lt;not&gt;&lt;operator&gt;value</p>
  <p style="margin-left: 48px;">&lt;not&gt; is the optional ‘not operator’ (‘!’)</p>
  <p style="margin-left: 48px;">Valid &lt;operator&gt;s are</p>
  <p style="margin-left: 48px;"> ‘=’<br/>
     ‘&lt;&gt;’<br/>
      ‘&gt;’<br/>
     ‘&gt;=’<br/>
     ‘&lt;’<br/>
     ‘&lt;=’</p>
  <p style="margin-left: 8px;">If no operator is present, &#39;=’ is assumed.</p>
  <p style="margin-left: 8px;">Examples:</p>
  <p style="margin-left: 88px;">50 (and the equivalent ‘=50’)<br/>
    &lt;50<br/>
    !&lt;50 (equivalent to ‘&gt;=50)<br/>
    &gt;=2017-01-01<br/>
    &lt;not&gt;&lt;firstValue&gt;_&lt;lastValue&gt;<br/>
    &lt;not&gt; is the optional ‘not operator’ (‘!’)<br/>
    The values represent an inclusive range<br/>
    Example: 2017-01-01_2017-12-31</p>
  <p style="margin-left: 48px;">The list of ‘or clauses’ can be proceeded with a ’global not’ operator ( ‘~’). So while</p>
  <p style="margin-left: 48px;">50,60</p>
  <p style="margin-left: 48px;">will include all lines having a value of 50 or 60 in the column,</p>
  <p style="margin-left: 48px;">~50,60</p>
  <p style="margin-left: 48px;">will include all lines NOT having a value of 50 or 60 in the column.</p>
  <p style="margin-left: 8px;">‘Wild Card’ filters may be used with the actual or implied ‘=’ operators on non-numeric columns. Either ‘%’ or ‘*’ may be used as the Wild Card character.</p>
  <p style="margin-left: 8px;">If users enter a column filter that would result in no lines being displayed:</p>
  <p style="margin-left: 48px;">An Error Message will be displayed.<br/>
    The list will not be updated.<br/>
    The filter will be restored to its previous value.</p>
  <p style="margin-left: 8px;">When users hover the mouse over a title column, the status pane will now display the following:</p>
  <p style="margin-left: 48px;">A reminder that users can left click on a column to sort the list by that column.<br/>
    A reminder that users can right click on a column to apply a filter to that column.<br/>
    In addition, the current value of the filter (if there is one) will be displayed.</p>
  <h3>1.9.4 Viewer Child Tabs </h3>
  <p>This update changes the contact child “Firm” field to “Contact Group” matching the value pulled from Client Site Contacts. This update keeps it consistent throughout SAMPro.  </p>
  <h3>Keyboard Equivalents</h3>
  <p style="margin-left: 8px;">The user may now toggle between the Magnify and Line views of the selected child tab line with the keyboard equivalent Ctrl+Q or Ctrl+q.  </p>
  <h3>1.9.5 All Viewers: Combined Add/Save Sidebar Button</h3>
  <p>In all previous versions of SAMPro, separate buttons were used to Add a new record or Change an existing record. This was useful for managing record cloning as the Add button would be enabled what a new record was started. In this release, a single button will be used to save or add a record. The icon used on the button will indicate if a record is being changed or added, or if the button is disabled. The addition of the + sign to the button when the record is in Add mode will provide a visual clue that a new record is being added while maintaining the standard usage of a single button for the save process.</p>

  <h3>1.9.6 Title Bar</h3>
  <p>In Version 9.1.611.059 and up, users now have their user ID displayed on the SAMPro title bar. This is helpful for users to know which license they are using for SAMPro. </p>
  <h3>1.10 Journals Viewers with Tack Numbers</h3>
  <p>When most SAMPro journals are edited, the revised entry&#39;s id is usually appended with a &#39;tack&#39; number. The original journal entry cannot be edited if it has been replaced with a new entry (with a higher &#39;tack&#39; number). In this release, the user is warned if they access a journal entry which has been replaced. For example, if Purchase Orders are used as controlled documents, the following warning would appear:</p>
  <p style="margin-left: 48px;">WARNING: Purchase Order 123456 has been replaced by 123456-01.<br/>
    This record cannot be changed.</p>
  <p>This warning is designed to prevent the user from wasting time by attempting to make changes to a journal entry record which cannot be saved because it has already been replaced. See Customer Note 1.1.2 for a registry to disable this warning globally or by individual viewer.</p>
  <h2>1.11 Licensing</h2>
  <p>This release closes a loophole which allowed more Full User and TechAnywhere (Technician) records to be created than allowed by the Data-Basics license. If the maximum has been exceeded, the User/Technician records cannot be edited except to disable them. If this occurs:</p>
  <p style="margin-left: 48px;"><span style="font-weight: bold;">User Record:</span> Flag the Disabled flag on any Full User record not in service.</p>
  <p style="margin-left: 48px;"><span style="font-weight: bold;">Technician Record:</span> Active Techs not currently using TechAnywhere should have the Remote Device Type set to None so they will not be included in the TechAnywhere license count. These Technicians will not have access to TechAnywhere.</p>
  <p style="margin-left: 48px;"><img alt="" border="0" src="assets/images/RDTNone.jpg" style="border: none;"/></p>
  <p style="margin-left: 48px;"> </p>
  <p style="margin-left: 8px;">If additional Full User and/or Technician licenses are still required after disabling unused records, contact a SAMPro account manager.</p>
  <h3>1.11.1 <span style="font-weight: bold;">Read-Only Users</span></h3>
  <p style="margin-left: 8px;">This release prohibits any user with Access Type &#39;ReadOnly&#39; from executing any Starter Function.</p>
  <h2>1.12 Positive Pay</h2>

  <h3>1.14 <span style="mso-fareast-font-family: &#39;Times New Roman&#39;;">Default and Java 8 XmlToPdf.jar Files</span></h3>
  <p class="MsoNormal" style="margin-left: 6.0pt;"><span style="mso-bidi-font-weight: bold;">The default XmlToPdf.jar file included in this release will support both Java 7 and 8; it is dated</span> 2017-12-29. It supports the revised W-2 reporting format and corrects a file &#39;cannot find this file&#39; error when running with UseOutlook enabled.</p>
  <p class="MsoNormal"><b style="mso-bidi-font-weight: normal;">Enhanced Java 8 Functionality:</b> The newest XmlToPdf.jar file (included as XmlToPdf [2018-06-29].jar) requires Java 8. <b style="mso-bidi-font-weight: normal;">Java 8 must be installed on ALL machines that will do emails, including one that runs scheduled events.</b>  This file supports enhanced error handling to give a number of different status codes based on where the error was encountered and what type of error it was. It logs the error to a new XmlToPdf.log file in the root SAMPro directory. To use this functionality:</p>
  <p class="MsoNormal" style="margin-left: .5in;">Change the name of the default XmlToPdf.jar file to XmlToPdfOUT.jar and then</p>
  <p class="MsoNormal" style="margin-left: .5in;">Copy the XmlToPdf [2018-06-29].jar and change the name of the copy to XmlToPdf.jar</p>
  <h2>1.15 Database Communications Recovery</h2>
  <p style="margin-left: 8px;">A ‘Comm Link Failure’ (CLF) occurs when SAMPro attempts to access a database on a network-connected server and the communication link to that server is inoperable (e.g., ethernet or wireless issues). This release intercepts CLFs on database queries and enters a ‘Recovery Loop’ which tries to re-establish the connection to the database server. When the connection is successfully re-established, SAMPro continues as if nothing has happened. Registry entries are available from Support if this functionality needs to be adjusted.</p>
  <h2>1.16  PDFJoiner.jar Enhancements</h2>
  <p>Previously, when attempting to use the &quot;Make a PDF&quot; function to merge several documents together, it would occasionally produce an error. In 9.1.611.061 and up, this update improves the performance of the call to find the error, makes multiple attempts, and writes more information to the error log if one does occur. </p>
  <p>The revised PDFJoiner.jar file dated 2018-03-14 supports joining secured PDFs, such as invoices received from Vendors. When the Make PDF button is clicked (or another functionality involving a PDF merge is invoked), PDFs that do not require a password to open will be merged. PDFs that do require a password to open will be skipped.   </p>
  <h2>1.17 Custom Fields</h2>
  <p>In previous releases, the Custom Fields functionality was label-specific. In other words, if a user changed a common label such as &quot;Email Address:&quot; in one viewer (say, the Client record) to &quot;Client Email:&quot; it would appear in all Viewers (e.g, Job, Client Site, etc.) as &quot;Client Email&quot;.  </p>
  <p>In this release the Custom Fields functionality has been enhanced to be <span style="text-decoration: underline; ">viewer-specific with the following exceptions:</span></p>
  <p style="margin-left: 48px;"><span style="font-weight: bold;">Id Field Labels:</span><br/>
    Custom Field Labels for record Id&#39;s are used wherever that record is referenced. For example, if a user changes the label &quot;Client Id:&quot; to &quot;Customer#&quot; the label Customer# will appear in the Client viewer as well as in the Job viewer.</p>
  <p style="margin-left: 48px;"><span style="font-weight: bold;">Labels to the right of the field:</span><br/>
    This release does not support the customization of labels that appear to the right of the fields, as is the case with most Checkbox (boolean) fields.</p>
  <p style="margin-left: 48px;"><span style="font-weight: bold;">Fields without Standard Labels:</span><br/>
    Some fields do not have a standard label defined; these may not be customized.</p>
  <p style="margin-left: 48px;"><span style="font-weight: bold;">Address Fields:</span><br/>
    Address fields may not be changed via Custom Fields but may be changed for all instances via Start Field Label Remap.</p>
  <p style="margin-left: 8px;">A new v.cus field is required to see this new functionality: contact a Support Representative if needed.</p>
  <h2>1.18 User Report Definition</h2>
  <p>Filter: The following token replacement strings are now supported in User Reports Definitions</p>
  <p style="margin-left: 48px;">^executiveprstring^<br/>
    ^executivepyrllprdstring^<br/>
    ^pmfilter^<br/>
    ^dscplnefilter^</p>
  <p>Users can add ^executiveprstring^,^executivepyrllprdstring^,^pmfilter^ or ^dscplnefilter^ in the user query with a corresponding filter.  </p>
  <h2>1.19 Lock Recovery (MSSQL Server Only)</h2>
  <p>In previous releases, when a database access function encountered a record lock condition an ‘Record Lock’ error message was displayed, and the transaction failed.</p>
  <p>This release provides a recovery process to resolve temporary locks for MS SQL databases; this functionality is not supported for Sybase databases. When enabled via the registry (see Customer Note 9.1.1 below), when a record lock condition is encountered, a dialog box will now be displayed. See the sample below.</p>
  <p class="Support"><img alt="" border="0" height="321" src="assets/images/recordlock.png" style="border: none; cursor: nesw-resize;" width="594"/></p>
  <p>The dialog box will include information as to the user who is holding the lock. This gives the locked-out user a chance to confer with the locking user who may be able to resolve the situation. If the user does not have permission to obtain the lock information, an appropriate message will be displayed instead of the lock information itself.</p>
  <p>The dialog box contains 3 buttons:</p>
  <p style="margin-left: 48px;">‘Try Again’. When selected, the dialog box will disappear, and the query will be attempted one additional time.</p>
  <p style="margin-left: 88px;">If after the attempt, the lock is still in effect, the dialog box will be redisplayed.</p>
  <p style="margin-left: 88px;">If, however, the lock has been cleared by the locking user so that the query is now successful, the user will be so notified, and processing will continue as if the lock had never been encountered.</p>
  <p style="margin-left: 48px;">‘Try For 60 Seconds’. When selected, the dialog box will disappear, and the query will be repeatedly attempted for approximately 60 seconds.</p>
  <p style="margin-left: 88px;">If, after the 60 seconds, the lock is still in effect, the dialog box will display ag.</p>
  <p style="margin-left: 88px;">If, however, anytime during the 60-second wait, the lock has been cleared by the locking user so that the query is now successful, the user will be immediately notified, and processing will continue as if the lock had never been encountered.</p>
  <p style="margin-left: 48px;">‘Cancel’ (or ‘X-ing’ out the dialog box). The query will be tried 1 more time.</p>
  <p style="margin-left: 88px;">If, after the additional try, the lock is still in effect, the query attempt will return a failure status and processing will continue as is currently implemented.</p>
  <p style="margin-left: 88px;">If, however, the additional try is successful, the user will be so notified, and processing will continue as if the lock had never been encountered.</p>
  <h3>1.19.1. Registry to Enable Database Lock Recovery Dialog Box</h3>
  <p>The Lock Recovery popup window was implemented in version 9.1.611.053a: when a lock was encountered a dialog box providing lock information and the option to Try Again, Try for 60 Seconds, or Cancel was displayed. In version 9.1.611.055a the default is to not show the new box, but instead display the old record lock message box that only required the user to click OK. The user waiting to make a decision on which of the three options to select could make things worse.  The dialog box can be re-enabled globally via registry setting noted below.  It can also be re-enabled for specific users via the User Registry child table for those users who understood how the use the functionality properly.</p>

  <h2>1.20 Launching External Apps / Documents</h2>
  <p>In Version 9.1.611.036, SAMPro Document opening was changed to try to improve the Windows Registry file extension lookup and to have a fallback to use Windows PowerShell to open the file as a last resort if SAMPro couldn&#39;t determine anything useful from the Windows Registry.</p>
  <p>Version 9.1.611.056 improves SAMPro&#39;s ability to read and interpret Windows. In addition, CMD (the Windows Command line) will be used to open Documents rather than PowerShell. This is important because some clients block their users from being able to use PowerShell. PowerShell is a powerful tool, and therefore many antivirus solutions and IT Systems Administrators restrict this application.  </p>
  <h2>1.21 WebHelp</h2>
  <p>In Version 9.1.611.058 and up, SAMPro&#39;s WebHelp will launch using the user&#39;s default browser.  Previously, Internet Explorer (soon to be retired in 2022) was used for WebHelp.</p>
  <p>In Version 9.1.611.059 and up, this issue was fixed so users are sent to specific WebHelp. Previously for SAMPro WebHelp, when clicking on the help option, the WebHelp would be sent to the default web instead of content-specific help.</p>
  <h2>1.22 Icons</h2>
  <p><span style="font-weight:bold;">MessageBox Icons:</span></p>
  <p>In Version 9.1.611.059 and up, the Microsoft &quot;Information&quot; Icon is now implemented. In previous releases, many of our SAMPro message boxes used the Microsoft &quot;Warning&quot; Icon, when they were not actual warnings. </p>
  <h2>1.23 Directory</h2>
  <p><span style="font-weight:bold;">Cache SAMPro Working Directory: </span></p>
  <p>In version 9.1.611.059 and up, this release solves an issue by caching the SAMPro base directory at login so that SAMPro can always find the XmlToPdf.jar file. In previous releases, a select number of users were unable to convert a file to PDF or email a file with the message &quot;Error: unable to access jar file&quot;. </p>
  <h2>1.24 General System Updates</h2>
  <p><span style="font-weight:bold;">Adobe PDF Printer:</span></p>
  <p>In this release, the Adobe PDF printer will not be displayed in the SAMPro printer list, whether or not it is the default printer. This is the new default behavior. This addresses an issue when customers receive an OS Error 16r6 when selecting &quot;Adobe PDF&quot; when printing. This is due to a new Adobe version update (released 1/12/22), resulting in a failure to post (e.g., Service Invoice) or other issues where a print confirmation is required.</p>
  <h1>2 Client, Site and Equipment</h1>
  <h2>2.1 Registry Entries</h2>
  <h2>2.2. Reports</h2>
  <h2>2.3 Site Equipment</h2>
  <h3>2.3.1 Main Tab</h3>
  <p>The Equipment Type Id is no longer cleared when the PCR Table Id is updated. This corrects a problem in TechAnywhere and in manual changes to the Site Equipment record.</p>
  <p><span style="font-weight: bold;">New Field: Deny TA Edit</span><br/>
    This field should be flagged if TechAnywhere Techs should be allowed to see and add charges to this Equipment, but NOT to edit the equipment details. This would typically be used to prevent technicians from filling in important details into the wrong/generic equipment record.</p>
  <h3>2.3.2 New Tab - Certifications</h3>
  <p>This version supports multiple Certifications per Equipment and Site.</p>
  <p>This new tab allows users to list Certifications required to work on the selected Equipment in addition to the Certification listed on the Equipment&#39;s Main tab.</p>
  <p>When TechFinder is launched from the Dispatch Board or Work Order, all Certifications for the Site and the first piece of Equipment on the Work Order will be listed. When TechFinder is launched from New Call, all Certifications for the selected and Equipment will be listed. This list is prepended with an ampersand &amp; so that only those Techs with all the Certifications listed appear in TechFinder.</p>
  <h3>2.3.3 Site Equipment PM Schedule Tab</h3>
  <p><span style="font-weight: bold;">Changed Field: Cost Category</span><br/>
    This field now supports enhanced filtering provided by the Cost Code&#39;s Job Cost Category Usage Filter. Cost Categories are validated (relative to Cost Codes) during data entry upon leaving the Cost Category Id field. The full relationship is validated again when leaving a childline or saving a record.</p>
  <h3>2.3.3a Site Equipment PM Schedule Lines for Master Contract &#39;Build Outs&#39;</h3>
  <p>If a PM Schedule line has a Master Contract reference but no WO Id it came from a Master Contract &#39;Build Out&#39; (currently supported only by customization). In this release, the user is allowed to edit these lines in order to assign different Parts and/or Task lists when Create PM WorkOrders is run. Note: Lines with a Master Contract Id AND Work Order Id may NOT be edited.</p>
  <h3>2.3.4 Site Equipment Service Tab</h3>
  <p><span style="font-weight: bold;">Service Tasks Id:</span><br/>
    This field is now used to provide a default for PM&#39;s generated from the Master Contract. In previous releases, if a Service Task Id wasn&#39;t specified on the Schedule tab of the Master Contract then no Task List was attached to the PM Work Order generated from that line. In this release, if the Service Task Id is blank on the Master Contract, the system now looks to this field instead. This enhancement allows for different Task Lists to be assigned by the Equipment scheduled. If a Service Task List is specified on the Master Contract&#39;s Schedule line, it will continue to be used for all Equipment scheduled for from that line.</p>
  <p style="font-weight: bold;">New Fields: Replacement Equipment Id:   Replacement (Date):<br/>
    <span style="font-weight: normal;">These display fields will be completed if the currently selected Equipment Id was replaced by the Replacement Equipment Id on the Replacement date listed from TechAnywhere. If the selected Equipment has NOT been tagged as replaced, these fields well be blank.</span> <span style="font-weight: normal;">See Customer Note 19.7 for additional details.</span>

  <h3>2.4.1 Certification Tab</h3>
  <p>This version supports multiple Certifications per Equipment and Site.</p>
  <p>This new child tab allows users to list Certifications required to work at the selected Site. It will apply to all Equipment associated with this Site. Certifications that are only applicable to certain Equipment at a site should be added to the Site Equipment&#39;s Certifications tab.</p>
  <p>When TechFinder is launched from the Dispatch Board or Work Order, all Certifications for the Site and the first piece of Equipment on the Work Order will be listed. When TechFinder is launched from New Call, all Certifications for the selected and Equipment will be listed. This list is prepended with an ampersand &amp; so that only those Techs with all the Certifications listed appear in TechFinder.</p>

  <h3>2.4.6 Site Service Tab</h3>
  <p><span style="font-weight: bold;">New Field: IVR Instructions</span><br/>
    This field is designed for the purpose of IVR instructions for the technician. This field is available for use in escalation emails (using the token ^clntste_ivr^). It is also designed for future use in TechAnywhere.</p>
  <h3>2.4.7 Main Tab</h3>
  <p><img alt="" border="0" src="assets/images/CopyAlias.bmp" style="border: none;"/>  This new button may be clicked to launch the Start Alias Update function with the Client Site filled in.

  <p>The first column of the Past Due summary box has been re-titled &#39;1-30 Days&#39; for clarity. It was previously titled &#39;Current&#39;.</p>
  <p>The &quot;Invoice Date&quot; field in the summary pane has been relabeled as &#39;High Balance Date&#39; to better describe its meaning.</p>
  <p><img alt="" border="0" src="assets/images/clientCollectionPrintStatement.bmp" style="border: none;"/> When this button is clicked, a customer statement report will be launched with the Client Id completed. By default, Report Customer Statements (RCUSTSTMNT) will be launched, but the following registry option allows a different report to be launched instead.</p>
  <p><span style="font-weight: bold;">Id:</span> sys-viewer-vclnt</p>
  <p><span style="font-weight: bold;">Setting Key:</span> StatementReportId   <span style="font-weight: bold;">Setting Value:</span> <span style="font-style: italic;">report function id</span></p>
  <h3>2.5.2 Client Collection Notes</h3>
  <p style="font-weight: bold;">Notes List New Field: Obsoleted<br/>
    <span style="font-weight: normal;">In previous releases, the user was unable to access obsoleted Collection notes. In this release, the Collection Notes List displays these notes so they can be accessed if needed.</span>
  </p>
  <p><img alt="" border="0" src="assets/images/image/SKIN1_SendEmail.gif" style="border: none;"/> The Email button has been added to the Collection Notes viewer to allow these Notes to be emailed directly. If any changes have been made to the note, it must be saved and reopened before it can be sent.</p>
  <p>This release supports the use of Common Phrases in the Notes viewer launched from a record. Commons Phrases may be added to the Notes field in the lower half of the screen by typing the Common Phrase Id and pressing Enter.</p>
  <h3><span style="font-style: italic;">2.5.3 </span>Client Range Screen</h3>

  <h2>2.6 Client Site Import</h2>
  <p>The Security Id has been added as the 94th column in the spreadsheet used with this function. If completed, it is used to set the Security Id of the Site, Job, Job Billing Item, Job Cost Code, and Site Equipment records.</p>
  <p style="margin-left: 48px;"><span style="font-weight: bold;">WARNING:</span> The new Security Id column should NOT be used with Intercompany Security:<span style="font-weight: bold;"> </span>Client Sites are generally not company-specific so it makes no sense for intercompany users to put something in the new column. In addition, Companies that use the older (non-Intercompany) Security that supports Site and Equipment as global records should NOT specify Security in the 94th column.</p>
  <h3><span>2.6.1 C</span>lient Site Import Enhancement - SAMPro 9.1.611.058 and Above</h3>
  <p>This release supports several enhancements to the Start Client Site Import Function.</p>
  <h5>New Columns</h5>
  <p>Rate Schedule Id has been added as a new column (CV) in the spreadsheet. This column is not required but must be valid when specified.</p>

  <p><span style="font-weight: bold;">Setting Key:</span> UseZipCodeTable  <span style="font-weight: bold;">Setting Value:</span> true (default false)</p>
  <p>When enabled, this option uses the Service Zone from the CSV on the import if specified and if not it retrieves it from the Zip Code table.</p>
  <p>In addition, when this registry is enabled, the Branch from the Zip Code will be used for the Site Branch and Job Branch.</p>
  <h5>Registry to Set Tax Group from Avalara</h5>
  <p><span style="font-weight: bold;">Setting Key:</span> SetTaxGroupFromAvalara    <span style="font-weight: bold;">Setting Value:</span> true (default false)</p>
  <p>Enabling this registry uses Avalara&#39;s Avatax Web functionality to set the Job’s Sales Tax Group when appropriate. If this is used the following setup must be observed:</p>
  <p style="margin-left: 48px;">The Sales Tax Group in the Job Template(s) must be blank</p>
  <p style="margin-left: 48px;">The Job Templates must have the Job Tax Status set to Sales</p>
  <p style="margin-left: 48px;">The Sales Tax Group must be blank in the Zip Code table.</p>
  <h5>Registry to Allow an Existing Site to be Used</h5>
  <p><span style="font-weight: bold;">Setting Key:</span> UseExistingSite   <span style="font-weight: bold;">Setting Value:</span> true   (default false)</p>
  <p>This setting eliminates the requirement that the New Site Id must not exist and allow additional jobs to be imported for an existing Site. Note: Any existing Sites will NOT be updated with contents from CSV.</p>
  <h2>2.7 Start Merge Client Sites</h2>
  <p>This release supports the ability to merge Documents from the Site being merged from into the Site being merged to.  If any Documents are attached to the &#39;from&#39; Site, the user will be prompted:</p>
  <p style="margin-left: 48px;">PLEASE CONFIRM: Do You Wish To Merge Client Site Documents?</p>
  <p style="margin-left: 48px;">If you click Yes to confirm, the Document will be attached to the Site you are merging into.</p>
  <h1>3 Accounts Payable</h1>
  <h2>3.1 Accounts Payable Registries</h2>
  <h3>3.1.1 Auto-set Requires Approval Designation  </h3>
  <p>One or both of the following registry entries may be set.</p>
  <p>If an AP Journal Entry would be set to Requires Approval via these registries, the system will display the warning that the A/P invoice will require approval. The user will be warned if the invoice amount or PO amount variance exceeds the registry-set limit. If the user has access to AP Approve Held Invoices (Start AP Payment Approved List), the message will also ask the user &quot;Would you like to approve invoice now?&quot;</p>
  <p style="margin-left: 48px;">If the user clicks Yes, they will be prompted to enter 40 characters of text describing the reason for the approval. This text will be written to the Vendor Invoice record&#39;s changelog.</p>
  <p style="margin-left: 48px;">If the user clicks No, the AP Journal entry will be saved as Requires Approved; it may be approved for payment via the standard Start AP Payment Approved List.</p>

  <p><span style="font-weight: bold;">Setting Key:</span> RequiresApprovalPOVariance   <span style="font-weight: bold;">Setting Value:</span>  <span style="font-style: italic;">percentvalue</span></p>
  <p>This registry enables an invoice to be flagged as Requires Approval if the Invoice Total entered in the AP Journal exceeds the PO Total by the specified percent. Note: Previous receipts against the PO are taken into account during this calculation.</p>
  <p style="margin-left: 48px;">For example, to require approval if the AP Journal amount exceeds the PO total by at least 8 percent:</p>
  <p style="margin-left: 48px;"><span style="font-weight: bold;">Setting Key:</span> RequiresApprovalPOVariance   <span style="font-weight: bold;">Setting Value:</span> 8</p>
  <h3>3.1.2 Registry To Include Only Open POs in Start Create EOM Unvouchered AP GL Entries</h3>
  <p>A new registry setting is available for defaulting the Date Closed range field to the appropriate &#39;sql=&#39; string so that only open PO&#39;s will be considered.</p>

  <h3>3.1.2a Registry to Require Credit by Entity in Create EOM Unvouchered AP GL Entries</h3>
  <p>When IntercompanyEnabled = true, then Balance Sheet GL Entities are universally required. Previously, Start Create EOM Unvouchered AP GL Entries required the following registry to determine a &quot;credit-side&quot; GL Entity. In this release, Credit Side Entities will be specified if EITHER of the following registries is enabled:</p>
  <p><span style="font-weight: bold;">Id:</span> sys-start-seomunvchrdap<br/>
    <span style="font-weight: bold;">Setting Key:</span> CreditsByEntity  <span style="font-weight: bold;">Setting Value:</span> true

  <p>New Button: <img alt="" border="0" src="assets/images/resetTaxOnLines.bmp" style="border: none;"/>  </p>
  <p>In previous releases, the user was allowed to change the Tax Group in the AP Journal. However, a warning was displayed user that the tax groups on the detail lines have to be reviewed and manually changed if needed.</p>
  <p>In this release, the new Reset Tax On Lines button (if enabled via registry) automates the process of changing the Tax Group on all of the Inventory, General, and Subcontractor lines, and automatically adjusting the necessary tax amount on such lines. This eliminates the need to touch every line on the AP Journal. Lines with Copied For Edit checked will be skipped.</p>
  <p>Note: This functionality does NOT pertain to the AP Journal Taxes tab; entries on this tab must be deleted priority to click the Reset Tax On Lines button. The user will be alerted if any lines appear on the Taxes tab when the button is clicked; these lines must be deleted before proceeding.</p>
  <p>A registry is required to enable the usage of the Reset Tax On Lines button. This setting should be discussed with the user&#39;s support representative before it is enabled.</p>
  <p><span style="font-weight: bold;">Registry Id:</span> sys-viewer-vapjrnl<br style="color: #000000; font-family: Verdana, &#39;Helvetica Neue&#39;, Helvetica, Arial, sans-serif;

    <span style="font-weight: bold;">Setting Key:</span> AllowResetTaxOnLines  <span style="font-weight: bold;">Setting Value:</span> true (default false)
  </p>
  <p>When enabled, when the AP Journal parent Tax Group Id is changed the user will be alerted that the Reset Tax On Lines button should be pressed to go thru the Inventory, General, and Subcontractor lines that have a Tax Group Id and emulate changing that field and updating the tax amount. If any errors occurs during the changing of the tax lines an Error Log will display at the end of the process to tell the user what to fix.</p>
  <h3>3.1.3b Registry to Prevent/Warn on Setting Bank GL Account if Vendor Has Expired Insurance/Blocked Payments</h3>
  <p>The following registry may be enabled make sure the user is not allowed to use manual checks/EFT/Credit cards and set the Bank GL Account to be able to pay a vendor with expired insurance that is blocking payments. This closes a &#39;back door&#39; that allowed the payment of blocked vendors.</p>
  <p><span style="font-weight: bold;">Registry Id:</span> sys-viewer-vapjrnl</p>
  <p><span style="font-weight: bold;">Setting Key:</span> BlockedPaymentHandling  <span style="font-weight: bold;">Setting Value:</span> warning or error (default warning)</p>
  <p>If the warning option is set or this option is absent, the user will be warned about the blocked payments but will be allowed to specify the GL Bank Account. If the option is set to error, the AP Journal cannot be added/edited with the GL Bank Account complete for a Block Payments / Insurance Required Vendor.</p>
  <h3><span>3.1.3c A</span>P Journal Registry Setting To Require a Work Order for Service Compute Jobs</h3>
  <p>Jobs indicated as &quot;Service Compute&quot; get billed by the Work Order, yet we allow costs to be entered and posted to Jobs w/o reference to any specific work order, leaving these unbilled costs in limbo. This feature may be activated to warn or error if a Work Order is not specified for Jobs flagged as &#39;Service Compute&#39;. These tests are ignored for lines imported from a PO.</p>
  <p style="margin-left: 48px;"><span style="font-weight: bold;">Note:</span> This setting may also be made globally in the sys-ffv-global-settings registry. If so, the local setting by Journal will trump the global entry.</p>
  <p><span style="font-weight: bold;">Registry Id:</span> sys-viewer-vapjrnl</p>
  <p><span style="font-weight: bold;">Setting Key:</span> NeedWOInServiceComputeJobs  <span style="font-weight: bold;">Setting Value: </span>Error, Warning or Neither (default Neither)</p>
  <p>When the Setting Value is set to <span style="font-weight: bold;">Error</span>, the user will be alerted when leaving a line lacking a Work Order Id and will not be able to save the record. Note: Implementing an Error on an existing system impacts the user&#39;s ability to edit existing entries. It should be implemented with caution.</p>
  <p>When <span style="font-weight: bold;">Warning</span> is implemented, the user will be alerted when leaving a line lacking a Work Order Id but will be able to save the record.</p>
  <p>If <span style="font-weight: bold;">Neither</span> is implemented (or the registry option does not exist) the user will not be alerted if a Service Compute type Job lacks a Work Order reference.</p>
  <h3>3.1.4 Registry to Sort AP Vendor Date-to-Pay List</h3>
  <p>A new registry entry has been added which can be used to control the sort order for the function. For example, this can be used to sort invoices by due date rather than invoice number.</p>
  <p><span style="font-weight: bold;">Id:</span> sys-viewer-sapdtetopylst</p>
  <p><span style="font-weight: bold;">Setting Key:</span>  OrderBy  <span style="font-weight: bold;">Setting Value:</span> <span style="font-style: italic;">field1,field2,...</span></p>
  <p>Any columns in the Vendor or Vendor Invoice tables should be eligible to be included in the  registry entry.  (Note: Default Order By is vndr_alpha, vndr_id, vndrinvce_invce_nmbr)</p>
  <p style="margin-left: 48px; text-decoration: underline; ">Example: Sort checklist by Vendor Alpha, Id and Vendor Invoice Payment Date</p>

  <p>The GLBankAccount and DefaultGLBankAccount options provide a means of defaulting the bank account. <font style="font-weight: bold; text-decoration: underline; ">Use of GLBankAccount and DefaultGLBankAccount should be thought of as mutually exclusive even though the Registry viewer won&#39;t prevent it. Do not use both!</font>
  </p>
  <p style="margin-left: 48px;"><span style="font-weight: bold;">Intercompany Note:</span> If the DefaultGLBankAccount option is set, the GL Bank Account specified in the registry defaults when the user selects the Company (or it defaults if only one Company is specified in the database). The Account is cleared if the user selects a different Company for which the registry is not set.</p>
  <p>The rules for Entity defaulting and validation are similar to the above description for GL Accounts.</p>
  <h5>Option to Disable the GL Entity Field (non-Intercompany installations only)</h5>
  <p><span style="font-weight: bold;">Setting Key:</span> disabledFieldsParent    <span style="font-weight: bold;">Setting Value:</span> <span style="font-style: italic;">glentty.id</span></p>
  <p>This option is designed to prevent the GL Entity from being inadvertently entered for non-Intercompany SAMPro installations. It should only be enabled if the GL Entity should NEVER be entered when printing this type of check.</p>
  <h3><span>3</span>.1.6 Registry to Protect Dollar Amount in Canadian AP Checks</h3>
  <p>By default, Canadian AP checks are set up to show the check amounts as unprotected (no asterisks preceding the dollar amount). The following registry may be enabled to protect the amount with leading asterisks on both the stub and actual check.  This registry entry will only affect Canadian AP checks.</p>
  <p><span style="font-weight: bold;">Id:</span> sys-report-rapchck</p>
  <p><span style="font-weight: bold;">Setting Key:</span> ShowCACheckAmountProtected  <span style="font-weight: bold;">Setting Value:</span> true</p>
  <p style="margin-left: 48px;"><span style="font-weight: bold;">Important:</span> The registry setting PrintDollarSign should be disabled if the registry setting ShowCACheckAmountProtected is invoked.</p>
  <h3>3.1.6a Registry to Specify MICR Font</h3>
  <p>Some recent versions of Troy printer drivers (and other drivers used to print MICR checks) require that a specific MICR font is specified in the SAMPro check reports. In previous versions, this required a customization file to specify the font and font size. In this release, the MICR font may be specified in the registries for Payroll, Accounts Payable, and PR Miscellaneous Deductions checks. The true type GnuMICR font is currently recommended for most applications.</p>
  <p style="margin-left: 48px;"><span style="font-weight: bold;">Important:</span> The MICR font must be installed in Windows on all computers checks will be run from.</p>

  <p style="margin-left: 8px;">Additional registry entries are required for MICR printing: see Help for additional settings for check printing.</p>
  <h3>3.1.6b AP Check Registry to Suppress Dollar Sign for US Installations</h3>
  <p>New functionality allows non-Canadian customers to use the following registry entry to suppress printing the $ sign on the AP Check. Previously, this was only available to users with Canadian customizations. Note that disabling the dollar sign on the check also removes it from the check amount printed on the stubs.</p>

  <h3>3.1.8 Registry to Display Error or Warning if AP Journal Effective Date Precedes Last PO Receipt</h3>
  <p>This registry may be enabled to prevent or warn the user if the PO&#39;s Voucher Effective dates would precede the PO Receipt date. This registry impact AP Journal entries for Purchase Orders with Inventory or General lines. Credit PO&#39;s and dollar-based PO&#39;s (with detail added on the Subcontractor tab) are not impacted.</p>

  <p><span style="font-weight: bold;">Setting Key:</span>  EvaluatePOReceiptDates   <span style="font-weight: bold;">Setting Value:</span> warning or error</p>
  <p>If this registry is not present, the user will not be notified if the Last PO Receipt Date precedes the AP Journal&#39;s Effective Date.</p>
  <p>If a Setting Value of warning is specified, the user will be Warned on adding/saving the entry if the AP Journal&#39;s Effective Date precedes the Last PO Receipt date. If the entry is in Add mode, the user will be given the opportunity to change the Effective Date before adding the entry:</p>
  <p style="margin-left: 48px;">WARNING: Effective Date should not precede PO Last Receipt Date<br/>
    Select YES to use the date or<br/>
    Select No to correct the date before saving.</p>
  <p style="-webkit-text-stroke-width: 0px;"><span style="text-decoration-style: initial; 
												 text-decoration-color: initial;">If a Setting Value of error is specified, the user will be not be allowed to add the entry until the Effective Date is corrected. If the entry was previously saved, the user will be allowed to edit it as long as the Effective Date is not changed to a value preceding the Last PO Receipt.</span></p>
  <p style="margin-left: 48px;"><span style="font-weight: bold;">Note:</span> AP Journal&#39;s Last PO Receipt Date<br/>
    This display field displays the most recent receipt date of the selected PO.</p>
  <p style="margin-left: 48px;">If the AP Journal is in Add mode and the User has selected from a list of IRJ transactions, this field displays the IRJ&#39;s Date Received. NOTE: this refinement ONLY applies during ADD mode because the selected IRJ is not saved with the APJ entry. For edits of existing transactions, the overall last Date Received of all Inventory Receipts will be used.</p>
  <p style="margin-left: 48px;">If items were received on the PO itself, the PO&#39;s Release Date will be displayed.</p>
  <h5>3.1.8a AP Journal Registry to Use Default Service Job in the Equipment record for all but PM WO’s</h5>
  <p>
    <font style="font-weight: bold;">Registry Id: <span style="font-weight: normal;">sys-viewer-</span></font>vapjrnl
  </p>
  <p>
    <font style="font-weight: bold;">Setting Key:</font> DefaultJobByEquipmentId <font style="font-weight: bold;">Setting Value:</font> true
  </p>
  <p>By default, the system uses the Job in the Work Order header as the default job for entering WO-related detail in the AP Journal. This release supports the above registry setting to alter this behavior. If this registry entry is enabled (and the referenced WO is NOT preventative maintenance), the system will check to see if there is a default service job in the Equipment header. If so, the Job, Cost Code and Billing item to the from the Equipment will be defaulted instead of from the WO header. If the job info is blank in the equipment record, the system uses the job info in the work order header.</p>
  <p>For Preventive Maintenance Work Orders, Job information defaults from the WO header, regardless of whether or not this registry entry is enabled.</p>
  <h5>3.1.8b <span style="font-weight: bold;">AP Journal - Set GL Entity for Intercompany Installations </span></h5>
  <p>If Intercompany is enabled, the balance sheet GL Entity is not &#39;sticky&#39;. Customer Note 1.14 details the new registries for setting the Default Balance Sheet Entity for this journal or globally. </p>
  <h5>3.1.8c AP Journal Registry to Retain Date and Period</h5>
  <p>When entering in invoices in the AP Journal, if the Effective Date and the Period ID are changed, they remain the same for the next journal if there is no PO entered. But if you do enter a PO ID, then the period goes back to the default. The effective date does not change. With the following registry enabled, the Accounting Period and Date will not change from the first journal entry in the session, even if a PO Id is specified.</p>
  <p><span style="font-weight: bold;">Registry Id:</span> sys-viewer-vapjrnl        </p>
  <p><span style="font-weight: bold;">Setting Key:</span> retainDateAndPeriodWhileInSession   <span style="font-weight: bold;">Setting Value:</span> true (default false)</p>
  <h3>3.1.9 Registry to Implement Vendor Id Auto-sequencing</h3>
  <p>This release supports the auto-sequencing of the Vendor Id via the following registry. The sequencing will start at 10001 and will automatically skip ahead if a collision is detected. <span style="font-weight: bold;">This registry should be discussed with your support representative before it is implemented.</span></p>
  <p><span style="font-weight: bold;">Registry Id:</span> sys-ffv-global-settings</p>
  <p><span style="font-weight: bold;">Setting Key:</span> autosequenceVendorid  <span style="font-weight: bold;">Setting Value:</span> true  (default false)</p>
  <p>If the registry is true users may not specify the Vendor Id when adding a new record. The Id may be changed once the Vendor record has been added.  </p>
  <h2>3.2 AP Reports</h2>
  <h3>3.2.1 AP Check</h3>
  <p>Corrects extraneous printing of &#39;Void&#39; on 2nd signature line for regular AP Checks. Also modifies print of EFT checks to only print 1 Void line on 1st signature line.</p>
  <p>This release prevents users from printing AP Checks that are currently being updated by the AP Date to Pay function, preventing possible double-payment of the Vendor Invoice.  </p>
  <p>The check total amount has been added to the lower right-hand position of the stub(s) of live and EFT checks.</p>
  <p>This release corrects sporadic locking issues when various users attempted to print AP Checks for different securities at the same time.</p>
  <p style="font-weight: bold;">New Field</p>
  <p><span style="font-weight: bold;">Check Print:  All Checks - Physical Checks - EFT Checks</span><br/>
    This field may be used to separate EFT and Physical Checks. The All Checks option prints both Physical and EFT checks. Select Physical Checks to only print live checks, or  EFT Checks to live the run to EFT&#39;s.</p>
  <h3><span style="font-weight: bold;">3.2.2 R</span>eport AP Check Reconciliation - RCKRECN-AP</h3>
  <p style="margin-left: 8px;">This new report, dated 2015-08-19, excludes PR checks. Only AP and PRMD checks will be listed.</p>
  <h3><span style="font-weight: bold;">3.2.3 Report Unvouchered AP Summary (RUNVCHRDAP3)</span></h3>
  <p style="margin-left: 8px;">The report revised 2016-06-15 adds ending date header and corrections to page header.</p>
  <h3>3.2.4 Report Vendor Payment History (VNDRPYMNTS.rpt)</h3>
  <p style="margin-left: 8px;">The Report Vendor Payment History (VNDRPYMNTS.rpt) dated 2017-01-26 was revised to display the 1099 Category of each Vendor.  Users may also filter on the 1099 Category in this report.</p>
  <h3>3.2.5 Report EFT Accounts Payable</h3>
  <p>Now supports checks of over 1 million in the AP EFT processing. Previously, the leading digit was truncated from the amount field.</p>
  <p style="font-weight: normal;">The ACH file that is generated when Report EFT Accounts Payable is run now specifies the SEC code CCD in the batch header for payments to businesses. Previously, PPD (used for payments to employees) was inappropriately hard-coded into the batch header of the ACH file.</p>
  <p style="font-weight: normal;">This release corrects the landscape formatting of the printed Electronic Payment Register report generated when Report EFT Accounts Payable is run to produce the electronic file for direct deposit.</p>
  <h3>3.2.5a Registry Report EFT AP</h3>
  <p>This registry sets the default GL Account / GL Entity when the printed EFT register is run.</p>
  <p>A separate registry (sys-eftap-glaccountid) is required for the output of the ACH file itself.</p>

  <h3>3.2.5b Report EFT Accounts Payable PaymodeX</h3>
  <p>This release supports custom PaymodeX functionality. A registry setting plus special use of the Vendor User fields is required to implement this functionality.</p>

  <p>This specifies that PaymodeX will be used for AP EFT files. This functionality depends on the following Vendor User Fields instead of the usual Vendor Bank Routing/AccountNo values:</p>
  <p style="font-weight: bold;">Using Custom Fields, designate Vendor User Field 4 as “Collecting Paymode-X Account ID”</p>
  <p>User Field 4 is the Paymode-X account number for the vendor; having this filled in means that it will be picked up by the Paymode-X processing otherwise, it will not be.<span style="font-weight: bold;"> </span></p>
  <p style="font-weight: bold;">Using Custom Fields, designate Vendor User field 5 as “Paymode-X - Method”.</p>
  <p>This field can be set to be ACH, Card, Check, n/a, or blank (if blank or n/a is treated as Check).<span style="font-weight: bold;"> </span></p>
  <p>The AP Check report is sensitive to the above for determining print MICR-Check versus Electronic Payment:</p>
  <p style="margin-left: 48px;">o Paymode-X: Checks and MICR-Checks utilize the existing check # assignment range</p>
  <p style="margin-left: 48px;">o Paymode-X: ACH and Card remittances utilize the EFT # assignment range</p>

In this release, Report AP Check Manual will first reference sys-report-rapchckmnl. In the absence of the sys-report-rapchckmnl registry, if sys-report-rapchck is available is it used.</p>
  <p style="margin-left: 48px;"><span style="font-weight: bold;">Tip:</span> The sys-report-rapchckmnl registry will allow users with special check processing enabled (such as Paymode-X) for Report AP Check to use the single-write check function without the special processing. This will allow these users to easily clear credit memos.</p>
  <h3 style="margin-left: 8px">3.2.17 AP Aging</h3>
  <p>In version 9.1.611.059 and up, resolved a very obscure issue that invoices with Unpaid “non-retainage” equaling Unpaid “retainage” would fail to qualify for the report and would thus throw total out of balance with G/L. Release date: 11-12-2021</p>
  <h2>3.3 AP Journal</h2>
  <p>If multiple Inventory Receipt Journal (IRJ) entries are present, a list will appear when the PO is selected, allowing the user to choose All or a specify IRJ entry (the IRJ&#39;s Trx Id, Date Received, Description and in some cases a Ship Notice).  In this release, the list box has been made wider to allow the user to view more of the information associated with the Inventory Receipt.</p>
  <p>This release corrects incorrect validation that allowed you to create an AP Journal Entry towards a Cancelled Credit PO. Note that PO&#39;s are considered to be Cancelled if the status is &#39;Cancelled&#39; on the Status tab.  </p>
  <p>When Intercompany is enabled and a detail line contains a Job Id, any changes to the line&#39;s GL Entity are validated to ensure that the new GL Entity belongs to the same company as the Job.</p>
  <p>The AP Journal posting logic has been corrected to reverse the sign on JCH Committed Cost $ when posting a PO-SUB line for a Credit Memo.</p>
  <p>This release corrects a currency conversion rounding error between the cost written to the Subcontractor, General and CM tabs and the cost being posted to JCH. This resulted in entries being off by pennies preventing them being vouchered.  APJ line amounts are now rounded to 2 decimals before summing to be comparable to JCH postings.</p>
  <p>This release refines the Manual Check # validation tests so that it ignores check #&#39;s for Check records of type &#39;EFT&#39;.  </p>
  <p>Corrects an error -143 from the previous release when a Credit Purchase Order is selected.</p>
  <p>Job Cost Categories are not needed if a Job/Work Order is not specified. When loading an APJ entry into the viewer, the Job Cost Category will be cleared if a Job is NOT specified on a detail line.</p>
  <p>Postings to the Bank Account specified in the AP Manual Check section ONLY use the GL Entity on the Main tab when InterCompany is enabled via registry. If InterCompany is NOT enabled, the GL Entity is not used for Manual Check / EFT / CC posting and Check records.</p>
  <p>A warning is now displayed if a user accesses a journal entry which has been replaced by one with a higher &#39;tack&#39; number. This warning is designed to prevent the user from wasting time by attempting to make changes to a journal entry record which cannot be saved because it has already been replaced. See Customer Note 1.1.2 for a registry to disable this warning globally or by individual viewer.</p>
  <p>This release corrects the calculation of Tax Cost on subsequent AP entries where the PO had previously been partially vouchered.</p>
  <p>This release refines the allocation of line item Tax Cost credit amounts to Tax Authorities. A Tax Authority only qualifies for inclusion in the allocation when EITHER of the following is true:</p>
  <p style="margin-left: 48px;">1. The APJ line&#39;s Tax Type is Use.<br/>
    2. The Group Tax Authority line&#39;s Job Cost flag is True.</p>
  <p style="font-weight: normal;">The rules regarding allowed Cost Category Types have changed as follows:</p>

  <h2>3.3.1 General Tab</h2>
  <p><strong></strong>This update corrects a defect with Credit APJ that could occur when selecting Reset Tax after changing the tax group creating a GL Out of Balance error. Credits would only pass when the users would not use the Reset Tax button, but leave the Tax Group as is, and edit the tax amount in the lines. This update now allows users to Credit APJ using the Reset Tax button.</p>
  <p>Previously, while running the End Of Month Unvouchered AP function, when a user clicked the Clear All or Check All buttons, the workspace &quot;Month-End Unvouchered Accounts Payable Worksheet&quot; became skewed. This update corrects this defect.</p>
  <p>Previously, users were unable to change the Job Cost Category from one Material type Job Cost Category to another Material type Job Cost Category on the AP Journal Inventory tab. This would result in an error message. This update corrects this defect.</p>
  <p>This update suppresses the pop-up warning if both the Due Days Type and Discount Days Type both have the “number of days” checkbox selected.</p>
  <p>This update adds an import button that imports a .CSV file directly into an AP journal&#39;s child tab General. The new import .CSV file button is located on the General tab sidebar and can only be utilized when the General child tab is in focus. <br/>
    Field: push-importAPJGeneral</p>
  <p>This release corrects a General tab defaulting issue where the Equipment did not default from the Work Order if a PO was NOT specified on the AP Journal header.</p>
  <p>The Other Rate Id AND Cost Category Id fields have both been moved to the right of the Job and Job Cost Code. This was done to prevent issues entering manually created lines that need Job Cost info when Cost Category usage restrictions are in place. This change applies to WinII and WinII derived customizations; a new customization file is needed to see the change.</p>
  <p style="font-weight: bold;"><span style="font-weight: normal;">Reversing General lines are now flagged as No Discount to avoid discount calculation issues when the Date Effective is edited.</span></p>
  <p style="font-weight: bold;"><span style="font-weight: normal;">General items entered on a PO now post the AP General Unit Cost to Inventory History if the cost is changed in AP.</span></p>
  <p style="font-weight: bold;">Changed Field: Cost Category<br/>
    <span style="font-weight: normal;">This field now supports enhanced filtering provided by the Cost Code&#39;s Job Cost Category Usage Filter. Cost Categories are validated (relative to Cost Codes) during data entry upon leaving the Cost Category Id field.  The full relationship is validated again when leaving a child line or saving a record.</span>
  </p>
  <h3>3.3.2 Material Returns Tab</h3>
  <p><span style="font-weight: bold;">Changed Field: Cost Category</span><br/>
    This field now supports enhanced filtering provided by the Cost Code&#39;s Job Cost Category Usage Filter. Cost Categories are validated (relative to Cost Codes) during data entry upon leaving the Cost Category Id field.  The full relationship is validated again when leaving a child line or saving a record.</p>
  <h3>3.3.3 Subcontractor Tab</h3>
  <p><span style="font-weight: bold;">Changed Field: Cost Category</span><br/>
    This field now supports enhanced filtering provided by the Cost Code&#39;s Job Cost Category Usage Filter. Cost Categories are validated (relative to Cost Codes) during data entry upon leaving the Cost Category Id field.  The full relationship is validated again when leaving a child line or saving a record.</p>
  <p><span style="font-weight: bold;">Changed Field: Revenue</span><br/>
    When a subcontractor PO is partially vouchered and the Amount is changed, the Revenue is now correctly recalculated based on the new Amount.</p>
  <h3>3.3.4 Inventory Tab</h3>
  <p><span style="font-weight: bold;">Changed Field: Cost Category</span><br/>
    This field now supports enhanced filtering provided by the Cost Code&#39;s Job Cost Category Usage Filter. Cost Categories are validated (relative to Cost Codes) during data entry upon leaving the Cost Category Id field.  The full relationship is validated again when leaving a child line or saving a record.</p>
  <h3>3.3.5 Main Tab</h3>
  <p><span style="font-weight: bold;">Changed Field - AP Terms:</span> The AP Terms is now written to the Vendor Invoice whether it defaults in from the PO or is manually added or changed by the user. Updating the AP Terms in the APJ also successfully updates the Vendor Invoice.<span style="font-weight: bold;"> </span></p>
  <p><span style="font-weight: bold;">Changed Field - Due Date:</span><br/>
    This release corrects errors in computing the Due Date based on the AP Terms and the Invoice Date.  </p>
  <p>If the Discount Days &lt;&gt; 0 the Discount Date is established first, then the “Dues Days” rule needs to be processed using that Discount Date as the basis for establishing Due Date when the Type is: “Day This Month” or “Day Next Month”. This will prevent the Due Date from preceding the Discount Date.  In addition, if the AP Terms code is configured badly, a message box will be displayed, warning the user that &quot;AP Terms Discount Days exceeds Due Days, cannot correct Due Date.&quot; when the AP Terms is selected or Invoice Date edited.</p>
  <p><span style="font-weight: bold;">Changed Field - Invoice #:</span> By default, the system now prevents the same Vendor Invoice from being vouchered multiple times; previously a registry was required for this validation.</p>
  <p><span style="font-weight: bold;">New Button:</span> <img alt="" border="0" src="assets/images/resetTaxOnLines.bmp" style="border: none;"/>  </p>
  <p>The new Reset Tax On Lines button (if enabled via registry in Customer Note 3.1.3a) automates the process of changing the Tax Group on all of the Inventory, General and Subcontractor lines, and automatically adjusting the necessary tax amount on such lines.</p>
  <p><span style="font-weight: bold;">New Field: Last PO Receipt</span><br/>
    This display field displays the most recent receipt date of the selected PO.</p>
  <p>If the AP Journal is in Add mode and the User has selected from a list of IRJ transactions, this field will be displayed based on the IRJ&#39;s Date Received. WARNING: this refinement ONLY applies during ADD mode because the selected IRJ is not saved with the APJ entry. For edits of existing transactions, the overall last Date Received of all Inventory Receipts will be used.</p>
  <p>If items were received on the PO itself, the PO&#39;s Release Date will be displayed.</p>
  <p>See Customer Note 3.1.8 for a registry to display an Error or Warning when selecting a PO whose Last PO Receipt date precedes the AP Journal&#39;s Effecting Date.</p>
  <p style="font-weight: bold;">Branch Id:<br/>
    <span style="font-weight: normal;">Corrects setting the Branch Id when the global setting BranchOverrideFrom=job is enabled and the Work Order is completed before the Vendor is selected.</span>
  </p>
  <p style="font-weight: bold;">New Field - New Line JC Defaults:</p>
  <p style="font-weight: bold;">Job Id:  Job Code: Cost Category:<br/>
    <span style="font-weight: normal;">When the Purchase Order Id is entered, the system will attempt to determine the Purchase Order can be used to provide default values for any new General lines the user might enter. If all detail (Inventory, General and Subcontract)  lines on the PO match, the result will be displayed and General line defaulting will be as follows:</span>
  </p>
  <p style="margin-left: 48px;">If the Job - Cost Code - Cost Category all match - all values default when adding General lines.</p>
  <p style="margin-left: 48px;">If the Job and Cost Code match but the Cost Category doesn&#39;t, only the Job and Cost Code default when adding new General lines.</p>
  <p style="margin-left: 48px;">If the Jobs match but the Costs Codes don&#39;t, the Job is not defaulted.</p>
  <p style="margin-left: 48px;">If only the Cost Categories match, the Cost Category will be used for defaulting General line.</p>
  <h3>3.3.6 Held Invoice Override</h3>
  <p>If a AP Journal Entry would be set to Requires Approval via the registries in Customer Note 3.1.1, the system will display the warning that the A/P invoice will require approval. The User will be warned if the invoice amount or PO amount variance exceeds the registry-set limit. If the user has access to AP Approve Held Invoices (Start AP Payment Approved List), the message will also ask the user &quot;Would you like to approve invoice now?&quot;</p>
  <p style="margin-left: 48px;">If the User clicks Yes, they will be prompted to enter 40 characters of text describing the reason for the approval. This text will be written to the Vendor Invoice record&#39;s change log.</p>
  <p style="margin-left: 48px;">If the User clicks No, the AP Journal entry will be saved as Requires Approved; it may be approved for payment via the standard Start AP Payment Approved List.</p>
  <h3>3.3.7 EFT/Credit Trx Id Validation Relaxed</h3>
  <p style="margin-left: 8px;">In previous releases, the EFT/Credit Trx Id could not be completed in a previously saved AP Journal Entry to turn it into a prepaid one. In this release, the validation has been relaxed to allow an existing AP Journal Entry have the Payment Type set to EFT or CR/DB and have the GL Bank Account set to the appropriate value. If the user does not set the EFT Trx ID the AP Journal Trx. will be entered when the Journal Entry is saved.</p>
  <p style="margin-left: 8px;">Validation prevents the EFT Trx ID from being changed once it has been entered and the entry saved. In addition, the transaction cannot be changed if a check has been printed and posted for it. Validation also ensures that the EFT Trx ID is not repeated for the same GL Account / GL Entity combination.</p>
  <h2>3.4 New Viewer: Check (Vendor)</h2>
  <p>This new Viewer lists ONLY Vendor (AP and PRMD) checks.</p>
  <p>User Group: Since this is a new viewer, access must be assigned to the appropriate User Group(s).  Unless the User Group also need access to PR Checks, we recommend turning off access to View Checks.</p>
  <h5>Registry Settings to Disable Fields</h5>
  <p>Unless Checks are being entered as part of the startup process, edits to View Checks (Vendor) should be disabled. We recommend the following settings for the new View Checks (Vendor) viewer.</p>
  <p><span style="font-weight: bold;">Id:</span> sys-viewer-vchcklstap</p>

  <h2>3.5 Recurring AP Journal</h2>
  <h3>3.5.1 Recurring Lines Tab</h3>
  <p><span style="font-weight: bold;">Changed Field: Cost Category</span><br/>
    This field now supports enhanced filtering provided by the Cost Code&#39;s Job Cost Category Usage Filter. Cost Categories are validated (relative to Cost Codes) during data entry upon leaving the Cost Category Id field.  The full relationship is validated again when leaving a child line or saving a record.</p>

  <h3>3.5.2 Start Release Recurring AP Journal</h3>
  <p>This release writes the Recurring AP Check Description to the corresponding Vendor Invoice and AP Journal Check Description fields. This field will be used when the AP Check is printed.</p>
  <p>This release eliminates the spurious &#39;Add taxes cannot be run if child tax lines exist&#39; message that interfered with the running of this function.</p>
  <h3>3.5.2a Start Release Recurring AP Journal Checklist</h3>
  <p>The following columns have been added to the Checklist screen from the Release Recurring AP Journal starter function:</p>
  <p><span style="font-weight: bold;">Recurring $ - Day: - Payment Type:</span>  </p>
  <p>Note that the Day column refers to the field &#39;Day (0-31)&#39; in the Recurring AP Journal, which is the day of the month that will be used as the effective date for AP Journal entries generated from that record. <span>If the Day (0-31) is set to &#39;0&#39; in the AP Recurring Journal, the Day column will be blank, but the Effective Date entered on the range screen will be used when the AP Journal is released. </span></p>
  <p>The Payment Type now displays for all checklist lines; previously it only displayed for the selected record.</p>
  <h2>3.6 Lien Waiver Processing</h2>
  <h3>3.6.1  Overview</h3>
  <p>SAMPro now supports Partial and Final Lien Waiver Processing.  This expended functionality supports the generation of Partial and Final Lien Waiver documents for subcontractors following the generation of AP Checks. Both the Job and Vendor must be flagged as Lien Waiver Required before a Purchase Order is generated to implement this enhancement so that the PO&#39;s Lien Waiver flag will carry through to the individual Vendor Invoices and AP Checks.  </p>
  <p>The Lien Waiver Documents generated by the new reports would then be sent to the Contractors for their signatures/notarization.</p>
  <h3>3.6.2 Changes / Additions to Related Records</h3>
  <p style="font-weight: bold;">Vendor - New Field</p>
  <p style="margin-left: 48px;"><span style="font-weight: bold;">Lien Waiver Req&#39;d?</span><br/>
    This field should be checked if Lien Waivers are required for this Vendor for a Job that also requires Lien Waivers.  Lien Waiver Processing is only enabled if both the Vendor and Job require Lien Waivers.</p>
  <p style="font-weight: bold;">Job - Changed Field</p>
  <p style="margin-left: 48px;"><span style="font-weight: bold;">Lien Waiver Req&#39;d?</span><br/>
    This field should be checked if Lien Waivers are required for this Job.  Note that Lien Waiver Processing will only be enabled if both the Vendor and Job require Lien Waivers.  In version 9.0, only the Job&#39;s Lien Waiver status was considered.</p>
  <p style="font-weight: bold;">Purchase Order - Changed Field</p>
  <p style="margin-left: 48px;"><span style="font-weight: bold;">Lien Waiver Req&#39;d (below Vendor Id)</span><br/>
    This field is displayed from the Vendor record.  </p>
  <p style="margin-left: 48px;"><span style="font-weight: bold;">Lien Waiver Req&#39;d (to the right of the Job Id)</span><br/>
    When BOTH the Job Record&#39;s Lien Waiver Required and the Vendor&#39;s Lien Waiver Required fields are checked, Purchase Orders for this Job and Vendor will also be flagged as Lien Waiver Required when they are created.  If a Work Order referenced in the PO header, the Lien Waiver flag will also be checked if BOTH the Work Order&#39;s header Job and the Vendor require Lien Waivers.</p>
  <p style="margin-left: 48px;">The PO&#39;s Lien Waiver flag will carry through to individual Vendor Invoices and AP Checks.</p>
  <p style="font-weight: bold;">AP Journal - Changed Field</p>
  <p style="margin-left: 48px;"><span style="font-weight: bold;">Lien Waiver Req&#39;d?</span><br/>
    This field will be checked if the PO used to generate it required Lien Waivers.</p>
  <p style="margin-left: 8px; font-weight: bold;">Vendor Invoice (Internal)</p>
  <p style="margin-left: 48px;"><span style="font-weight: bold;">Lien Waiver Req&#39;d?</span><br/>
    This field will be checked if the AP Journal used to generate it required Lien Waivers.</p>
  <p style="margin-left: 8px; font-weight: bold;">AP Check Record (Internal)</p>
  <p style="margin-left: 48px;"><span style="font-weight: bold;">Lien Waiver Req&#39;d?</span><br/>
    This field will be checked if the AP Journal / Vendor Invoice used to generate it required Lien Waivers.</p>
  <h3>3.6.3 Report Lien Waiver Partial (RLNWVRPRTL.rpt)</h3>
  <h5>Purpose:</h5>
  <p>This report lists Partial Lien Waivers based on the AP Checks which were printed for Lien Waiver Required Vendor Invoices. The Job Name, Site Address, and Client Name will be printed in the left-name Project/Owner section.  The Vendor Name, Address, Check Date and the lien waiver Amount will be printed in the right-hand Contractor section.  </p>
  <h5>Usage:</h5>
  <p>If this report is set to autosave via registry, it will be attached to the applicable Job, Vendor and Check records.</p>
  <h5>Important Fields:</h5>
  <p><span style="font-weight: bold;">Beginning Date:  Ending Date:</span><br/>
    These required fields define the AP Check date range to include when printing the Partial Waivers.</p>
  <p>The following ranges may be use to further limit the Partial Lien Waiver report:</p>
  <p><span style="font-weight: bold;">Vendor Id:</span><br/>
    Enter a Vendor Id to only print Waivers for the specified Lien Waiver Vendor.</p>
  <p><span style="font-weight: bold;">Job Id:</span><br/>
    Enter a Job Id to only print Waivers for the specified Lien Waiver Job.</p>
  <p><span style="font-weight: bold;">Purchase Order Id:</span><br/>
    If this field remains blank, the Lien Waiver Amount will reflect all Lien Waiver PO&#39;s processed each AP Check. Entering a PO Id (or list of Id&#39;s) in this range will limit the Amount listed on the Waiver to that allocated for the specified PO(s).</p>
  <p><span style="font-weight: bold;">Vendor Invoice Number:</span><br/>
    If this field remains blank, the Lien Waiver&#39;s Amount will reflect all Lien Waiver Vendor Invoices processed on each AP Check. Entering a Vendor Invoice Number (or list of numbers) in this range will limit the Amount listed on the Waiver to that allocated for the specified Vendor Invoice(s).</p>
  <p><span style="font-weight: bold;">Check Number:</span><br/>

  <h3>3.6.4 Report Lien Waiver Final (RLNWVRFNL)</h3>
  <h5>Purpose:</h5>
  <p>The Final lien waiver should be printed when it is determined that the check being sent to the Vendor is the last payment being made for work performed on a specific Job.</p>
  <p>This report lists Final Lien Waivers based on AP Checks which were printed for Lien Waiver Required Vendor Invoices. The Job Name, Site Address, and Client Name will be printed in the left-name Project/Owner section.  The Vendor Name, Address, Check Date and Amount will be printed in the right-hand Contractor section.</p>
  <p>If this report is set to autosave via registry, it will be attached to the applicable Job, Vendor and Check records.</p>
  <h5>Important Fields:</h5>
  <p><span style="font-weight: bold;">Beginning Date:  Ending Date:</span><br/>
    These fields define the AP Check date range to include when printing the Final Waivers.</p>
  <p>The following ranges may be use to further limit the Partial Lien Waiver report:</p>
  <p><span style="font-weight: bold;">Vendor Id:</span><br/>
    Enter a Vendor Id only print Waivers for the specified Vendor.</p>
  <p><span style="font-weight: bold;">Job Id:</span><br/>
    Enter a Job Id to only print Waivers for the specified Job.</p>
  <p><span style="font-weight: bold;">Purchase Order Id:</span><br/>
    If this field remains blank, the Lien Waiver&#39;s Amount will reflect all PO&#39;s processed on the AP Check. Entering a PO Id (or list of Id&#39;s) in this range will limit the Amount listed on the Waiver to that allocated for the specified PO(s).</p>
  <p><span style="font-weight: bold;">Vendor Invoice Number:</span><br/>
    If this field remains blank, the Lien Waiver&#39;s Amount will reflect all Vendor Invoices processed on the AP Check. Entering a Vendor Invoice Number (or list of numbers) in this range will limit the Amount listed on the Waiver to that allocated for the specified Vendor Invoice(s).</p>
  <p><span style="font-weight: bold;">Check Number:</span><br/>

  <h2>3.7 Vendor Type Record</h2>
  <p>
    <font style="font-weight: bold;">New Field - Obsolete?</font><br/>
    If this field is checked, the record is considered Obsolete, and it may not be directly specified during data-entry (either by entering the Id or selecting it from a list). Obsoleted records can be edited and the Obsolete option can be cleared when necessary.
  </p>
  <h2>3.8 Vendor Record</h2>
  <p>This release suppresses a spurious warning when the Vendor&#39;s status is set to &#39;Inactive&#39; when a new Vendor is added.</p>
  <h3>3.8.1 Vendor Viewer Defaults Tab</h3>
  <p style="font-weight: bold; margin-left: 8px;">New Field: 1 Invoice Per Check?<br/>
    <span style="font-weight: normal;">If this field is flagged, when AP Checks/EFT&#39;s are generated for this Vendor, one Check  will be printed for each Vendor Invoice.</span>
  </p>
  <p style="margin-left: 48px;"><span style="font-weight: bold;">Important Note on Credit Memos:</span><br/>
    Vendor credit memos are separate invoices and an AP Check can&#39;t be negative.  To process a Credit Memo, temporarily uncheck the I Invoice Per Check field and apply the credit memo to an outstanding invoice or 2, or 3.</p>
  <h3>3.8.2 Vendor Insurance Tab</h3>
  <p>This tab is now automatically sorted in descending order by the End Date when the Vendor record is saved. The most recently dated Insurance Entries will appear at the top of the tab so they are easier to review.   </p>
  <h3>3.8.3 Vendor List View</h3>
  <p>A new Sort Order, VendorByNameByAccountNumber has been added. The list displays the Vendor Name and Id, City, State, Address and Account Number (from the Vendor Default tab).</p>
  <h3>3.8.4 Vendor Range View</h3>
  <p>The Vendor&#39;s Account Number has been added as a Range field.</p>
  <h3>3.8.5 Vendor Main Tab</h3>
  <p><span style="font-weight: bold;">Changed Field - Status:</span><br/>
    In Vendor Record, if the user sets the Status to Inactive the system displays the following warning if the Vendor is referenced on any active (not Inactive or Obsolete) Inventory Item&#39;s Purchasing tab:</p>
  <p style="margin-left: 48px;">Warning: this Vendor is listed as the Primary Vendor on one or more active Inventory Items. Purchase Orders cannot be created for Inactive Vendors so the Primary Vendor on these items should be changed.</p>
  <p>When the user click OK to clear the above message, a workspace list of active Inventory Items where this Vendor is the primary Vendor.  This list may be printed so that these Item can be assigned a different primary Vendor on the Inventory Item&#39;s Purchasing tab.</p>
  <h3>3.8.6 Vendor Payments Tab</h3>
  <p>This release corrects an issue on the Vendor Payments Tab where a voided check could show as the LastCheckNo. Voided checks are now excluded from this tab.</p>
  <h2>3.9 Start AP Payment Approved List</h2>
  <p style="font-weight: bold; margin-left: 8px;">New Field: Overhead Jobs Only?<br/>
    <span style="font-weight: normal;">When this box is flagged, direct jobs are excluded and this function will be limited to:</span>
  </p>
  <p style="margin-left: 48px;">AP entries with no PO<br/>
    AP entries for PO&#39;s with no header Job/WO<br/>
    AP entries for PO&#39;s with an Overhead job in the header</p>
  <p style="margin-left: 8px;"><span style="font-weight: bold;">New Range - Job Id:</span><br/>
    This range allows you to limit this function to the Job (from the PO header) with which this payment is associated. If you leave this range blank, all eligible entries (subject to other range restrictions) will be selected.</p>
  <h2>3.10 AP Select Invoices for Payment / AP Date to Pay</h2>
  <p>Corrects an issue where this function caused a record lock; the missing commit has been added.</p>
  <p>This release prevents users from printing AP Checks that are currently being updated by the AP Date to Pay function, preventing possible double-payment of the Vendor Invoice.  </p>
  <p><span style="font-weight: normal;">Previously, overpaid invoices appeared on the AP Date-to-Pay list with the amount overpaid erroneously defaulted into the Discount to Take and Retainage to Pay fields. If the user failed to manually correct this, the credit would not happen and there will be inconsistent history postings. This release implements special handling for &#39;over paid&#39; invoices so that the overpayment is NOT defaulted to the Discount and Retainage fields. </span></p>
  <p style="margin-left: 8px;">In this release, the Next Pay Amount field will be completed appropriately when the Next Pay Day field is blank (01/01/1900).</p>
  <p style="margin-left: 8px;">This custom registry does the following for AP Check: <br/>
    1.    Move &quot;pay to the order of&quot; text value up two lines<br/>
    2.    Remove the bold from the &quot;Pay to the order of&quot; value displayed<br/>
    3.    Move the &quot;date&quot; and &quot;amount&quot; values up one line<br/>
    4.    Always display two asterisks before the dollar amount</p>
  <h2>3.11  PWP Billed List (AR Invoice Billed List)</h2>
  <h3>3.11.1 Selection Criteria</h3>
  <p>In previous releases, cost entered to a Service Compute Job without a work order being referenced &quot;marooned&quot; the cost as unbilled, having never had the opportunity (lacking a WO) to get included and billed on an invoice. The PWP Billing List has been enhanced to include UNBILLED JCH lines for Service Compute Jobs lacking a Work Order reference.</p>
  <h2>3.12 Start Void AP Check</h2>
  <p style="margin-left: 8px;"><span style="font-weight: bold;">New Field: Check Description:</span><br/>
    This field defaults from the Check record. It may be edited by the user to note the reason for the void. If the Check Description field was blank when the Check is voided, the system will continue to default in the Description using the following format: Voided 07/09/2018 01:36:39 PM UserId.</p>
  <h2>3.13 AP Payment Processing - Record Locking</h2>
  <p>This enhancement is designed to reduce the frequency of record locking issues when multiple users are processing AP Checks or running Date to Pay at the same time in a multi-company installation. During AP Check processing, the system will now:</p>
  <p style="margin-left: 48px;">Lock one Vendor Invoice at a time (instead of the whole batch)</p>
  <p style="margin-left: 48px;">Cleanup one Vendor Invoice at a time; and make multiple attempts to cleanup an invoice when sql error code indicates locked resource issue encountered</p>
  <p style="margin-left: 48px;">When posting AP Checks, commit/rollback one check at a time to minimize opportunity for resource locks</p>
  <p>When running Start AP Date to Pay the system will now:</p>
  <p style="margin-left: 48px;">Lock one Vendor Invoice row at a time</p>
  <p style="margin-left: 48px;">Clean up one Vendor Invoice row at a time</p>
  <h1>4 Purchasing</h1>
  <h2>4.1 Purchasing Registries</h2>
  <h3>4.1.1 Adjust Date or Accounting Period for Subcontractor POs Generated in New Call</h3>
  <p>By default, if a Subcontractor PO is auto-generated in New Call, there is no validation as to the Release Date and the Accounting period; today&#39;s date and the default Accounting Period are always used on the auto-generated PO unless trumped by the sys-newcall registry option AutoPOPeriodID.</p>
  <p>In this release, the following registry entry allows either the Date or Accounting Period to be adjusted to keep them in sync for Purchase Orders generated from New Call only.  If this registry is not enabled, the default Accounting Period and today&#39;s date will continue to be used. Note: this setting will also be trumped by the sys-newcall registry option AutoPOPeriodID if enabled.</p>
  <p><span style="font-weight: bold;">Id:</span> sys-viewer-vprchseordrlst</p>
  <p>When the defaulted Release Date and Accounting Period are NOT out-of-sync, NO adjustments are made to the defaulted values when a PO is generated from New Call.  The rules noted below are used only when an adjustment is necessary.</p>
  <p><span style="font-weight: bold;">Setting Key:</span> AdjustDefaultDateOrPeriod   </p>
  <p><span style="font-weight: bold;">Setting Value:</span> period<br/>
    The Accounting Period table is queried for eligible Accounting Periods.  To qualify, the period must be Active and its date range must include the defaulted Release Date.  When multiple periods are eligible, the one with the smallest Period Id is chosen to become the new Accounting Period for the current transaction.  If no eligible period is found, nothing is changed.</p>
  <p><span style="font-weight: bold;">Setting Value:</span> date<br/>
    The Release Date is adjusted to be either the Start Date or the End Date of the defaulted Accounting Period.  The Start Date is chosen when the current date is less than the Start Date.  The End Date is chosen when the current date is greater than the End Date.</p>
  <h5>4.1.1a Use Default Service Job in the Equipment record for all but PM WO’s</h5>
  <p>
    <font style="font-weight: bold;">Registry Id: <span style="font-weight: normal;">sys-viewer-</span></font>vprchseordrlst
  </p>
  <p>
    <font style="font-weight: bold;">Setting Key:</font> DefaultJobByEquipmentId <font style="font-weight: bold;">Setting Value:</font> true
  </p>
  <p>By default, the system uses the Job in the Work Order header as the default job for entering WO-related detail in the Labor, Purchase Order and AP Journal. This release supports the above registry settings to alter this behavior. If this registry entry is enabled (and the referenced WO is NOT preventative maintenance), the system will check to see if there is a default service job in the equipment header. If so, the Job, Cost Code and Billing item to the from the Equipment will be defaulted instead of from the WO header. If the job info is blank in the equipment record, the system uses the job info in the work order header.</p>
  <p>For Preventive Maintenance Work Orders, Job information defaults from the WO header, regardless of whether or not this registry entry is enabled.</p>
  <p>Note: a registry option to provide this functionality in the Work Order itself is already supported in sys-viewer-vwrkordr.</p>
  <p>Note: registry options to provide this functionality are also available in the Work Order, AP Journal and Labor Journal registries.</p>
  <h3>4.1.2 Disable Warning When User Accesses a PO That Has Been Replaced</h3>
  <p>When PO&#39;s are handled as controlled, the PO number (Id) will be appended with a &#39;tack&#39; number when it is saved as Changed. At this point, the original PO record cannot be edited since it has been replaced with a new entry (with a &#39;tack&#39; number).  In this release, users are warned if they access a PO entry which has been replaced.  For example, if Purchase Orders are used as controlled documents, the following warning would appear:</p>
  <p style="margin-left: 48px;">WARNING: Purchase Order 123456 has been replaced by 123456-01.</p>
  <p style="margin-left: 48px;">This record cannot be changed.</p>
  <p>This warning is designed to prevent the user from wasting time by attempting to make changes to a journal entry record which cannot be saved because it has already been replaced. This new default behavior may be disabled globally (sys-ffv-global-settings) or by individual viewer. :</p>
  <p><span style="font-weight: bold;">Registry Id:</span> sys-viewer-vprchseordrlst</p>
  <p><span style="font-weight: bold;">Setting Key:</span> DisableCase6552 <span style="font-weight: bold;">Setting Value:</span> true</p>
  <h3>4.1.3 Changed Purchase Order Registry Option: TechAnywherePostingStyle</h3>
  <p>The registry that controls how TechAnywhere Purchase Orders are handled has been charged so that the default value is now &#39;standard&#39;.  The standard SAMPro posting method (where job history is written) will now be used by default for PO&#39;s generated from TechAnywhere.</p>
  <p>In previous releases, the standard method could only be used if COD work orders were NEVER used. In this version, COD and (and other PO changes) are successfully handled since the Billable Quantity and Price updates are posted to the Purchase Order so the standard posting method is now the default.</p>
  <p><span style="font-weight: bold;">Registry Id:</span> sys-viewer-vprchseordrlst</p>
  <p><span style="font-weight: bold;">Setting Key:</span> TechAnywherePostingStyle <span style="font-weight: bold;">Setting Value:</span> standard  (default standard)</p>
  <p>To return to the old style (where PO&#39;s were NOT created with job history) the Setting Value would be set to nonstandard. This is <span style="font-weight: bold;">NOT</span> recommended, and should be discussed with your TechAnywhere Support Rep.</p>
  <h3>4.1.3a Recommended Purchase Order Registry for TechAnywhere</h3>
  <p>The following registry setting for the Purchase Order viewer should be used to provide control over changes to POs that were generated in the field via TechAnywhere.  In the absence of this setting, changes are allowed and the user is not alerted.</p>
  <p>TechAnywhere Purchase Orders should not be changed while the technician still has control of the work order. It isn’t until the Technician has completed the Work Order that every update is committed to the purchased items (job quantity. Changing a TechAnywhere Purchase Order may have adverse effects during TechAnywhere message posting.</p>
  <p><span style="font-weight: bold;">Setting Key:</span> EditTechAnywherePOs    <span style="font-weight: bold;">Setting Values:</span> warning  OR error</p>
  <p style="margin-left: 8px;">Warning Message: &quot;WARNING:  This PO was created from TechAnywhere.&quot;</p>
  <p>Error Message: &quot;This PO was created from TechAnywhere.  Changes are not allowed.&quot;</p>
  <h3>4.1.4 Invoiced Work Order Validation</h3>
  <p>This release supports the functionality of a registry that controls the validation of Work Orders which have been Invoiced in SAMPro viewers.  By default, when the user enters an invoiced Work Order Id in a journal or purchase order, the warning &#39;Work Order has already been invoiced.  Ok to Continue?&#39; will be displayed. The user will be allowed to select the Work Order. The following registry may be set in Purchase Order (as well as other viewers, such as the Labor Journal) to either error when an invoiced Work Order is entered, or to disable the message altogether.</p>
  <p><span style="font-weight: bold;">Id:</span> sys-viewer-vprchseordrlst  </p>
  <p>(May also be set in other journals (e.g, the Labor Journal (sys-viewer-vlbrjrnl))</p>
  <p><span style="font-weight: bold;">Setting Key:</span> WorkOrderInvoiceValidation  </p>
  <p><span style="font-weight: bold;">Setting Value:</span> error, warning, or disabled  (default warning)</p>
  <p>Note that &#39;error&#39; does not allow the user to continue, &#39;warning&#39; gives an option to continue, and &#39;disabled&#39; eliminates the warning/error. The default behavior with the registry absent is to give a warning.</p>
  <h5>4.1.5 Purchase Order - Auto Receive Credit PO&#39;s</h5>
  <p>If the Quantity Received amount is not set in a Credit PO, JCH posts as a negative committed cost versus negative actual cost...and isn&#39;t eligible for import to WO prior to the credit memo getting posted in APJ. To prevent this issue, when enabled via the following registry, only Credit type PO&#39;s will be auto received. When the user enters the Quantity in the Inventory or General tab of the Purchase Order, the Quantity Received field will default from the Quantity only for Credit PO&#39;s (which cannot be received in the Inventory Receipt Journal.</p>
  <p>This option would be a recommended companion to disabling QTY Received fields in the PO.</p>
  <p><span style="font-weight: bold;">Registry Id:</span> sys-viewer-vprchseordrlst</p>
  <p><span style="font-weight: bold;">Setting Key:</span>  AutoFillReceivedCreditOnly   <span style="font-weight: bold;">Setting Value:</span> true (default is false)</p>
  <p style="margin-left: 48px;"><span style="font-weight: bold;">Note:</span> The &#39;quantity ordered less than quantity received&#39; error message will not appear if the autoFillReceived or autoFillReceivedCreditOnly registry entries are enabled. Other existing validations still apply.</p>
  <h3>4.1.6 Purchase Order Registry To Require a Work Order for Service Compute Jobs</h3>
  <p>Jobs indicated as &quot;Service Compute&quot; get billed by the Work Order, yet we allow costs to be entered and posted to Jobs w/o reference to any specific work order, leaving these unbilled costs in limbo. This feature may be activated to warn or error if a Work Order is not specified for Jobs flagged as &#39;Service Compute&#39; when manual entries are recorded.</p>
  <p style="margin-left: 48px;"><span style="font-weight: bold;">Note:</span> This setting may also be made globally in the sys-ffv-global-settings registry. If so, the local setting by Journal will trump the global entry.</p>
  <p><span style="font-weight: bold;">Registry Id:</span> sys-viewer-vlbrjrnl</p>
  <p><span style="font-weight: bold;">Setting Key:</span> NeedWOInServiceComputeJobs  <span style="font-weight: bold;">Setting Value: </span>Error, Warning or Neither (default Neither)</p>
  <p><span style="font-weight: bold;">W</span>hen the Setting Value is set to <span style="font-weight: bold;">Error</span>, the user will be alerted when leaving a line lacking a Work Order Id and will not be able to save the record. Note that implementing Error on an existing system impacts your ability to edit existing entries. It should be implemented with caution.</p>
  <p>When <span style="font-weight: bold;">Warning</span> is implemented, the user will be alerted when leaving a line lacking a Work Order Id but will be able to save the record.</p>
  <p>If <span style="font-weight: bold;">Neither</span> is implemented (or the registry option does not exist) the user will not be alerted if a Service Compute type Job lacks a Work Order reference.</p>
  <h3>4.1.7 Purchase Order viewer (EDI)</h3>
  <p>This release includes an Add ShipVia line element to the PO XLM export if so requested in either of the following Registries.</p>
  <p><span style="font-weight: bold;">Id:</span> sys-edi  OR <span style="font-weight: bold;">Id:</span> sys-edi-haller</p>
  <p><span style="font-weight: bold;">Setting Key:</span> ExportShipVia  <span style="font-weight: bold;">Setting Value:</span> Y</p>
  <p>To turn on the export, the Setting key must be present, and the Setting Value must begin with ‘Y’, ‘y’, ‘T’, or ‘t’.</p>
  <p style="margin-left: 48px;"><span style="font-weight: bold;">NOTE:</span> An installation using this EDI functionality should have either the registry<b style="color: #000000; font-family: &#39;Segoe UI VSS &#39;, , &#39;Segoe UI&#39;, -apple-system, BlinkMacSystemFont, Roboto, &#39;Helvetica Neue&#39;, Helvetica, Ubuntu, Arial, sans-serif, &#39;Apple Color Emoji&#39;, &#39;Segoe UI Emoji&#39;, &#39;Segoe UI Symbol&#39;; 
	 font-size: 14px; font-variant-ligatures: normal; font-variant-caps: normal; 
	 text-align: start; -webkit-text-stroke-width: 0px; background-color: #ffffff; 
	 text-decoration-style: initial; text-decoration-color: initial;"> </b>sys-edi-haller  OR sys-edi implemented. If for some reason both are implemented, sys-edi-haller will take precedence.  </p>
  <h3>4.1.7a Random Inventory Purchase Lines Set to Tax Type = Prepaid</h3>
  <p>Previously when creating Purchase Orders for sales taxable jobs, utilizing the inventory tab, random inventory parts would get coded as tax type = &quot;prepaid&quot; due to existing logic set on data input, when in some uses cases they should not be.</p>
  <p>To add a check to ensure the value for the Tax Group on the purchase order General and Inventory tabs match the values on the child lines, a registry has been created:</p>
  <p><strong>Id:</strong> sys-viewer-vprchseordrlst</p>
  <p><strong>Setting Key:</strong> ValidateTaxGroupMismatch    <strong>Setting Value:</strong> (blank), error, warn</p>
  <p>When this registry is set to &quot;warn&quot; then on save, an error message will display stating that the Tax Group on all child lines should match that in the header, but the Purchase Order will be allowed to save.</p>
  <p>When it is set to &quot;error&quot; - a similar message will appear but the save will NOT complete until the tax group is manually updated on to match.</p>
  <p>When blank or disabled, no message displays and saves are allowed.</p>
  <h2>4.2 Purchasing Reports</h2>
  <h3>4.2.1 Report PO Form</h3>
  <p>The following Ranges have been added to the Purchase Order Report: Vendor Id, WO Id and PO Date Entered.</p>
  <p>This release corrects a spurious &#39;trim blanks&#39; error when the Windows Printer Dialog box is enabled and the &#39;PrintConfirmationDisabled&#39; registry entry was not enabled.  </p>
  <p>This release corrects the spurious error &quot;You cannot change this Purchase Order because it was spooled to the printer, but it was not marked as being successfully printed&quot; which could occur if the Print Confirmation was disabled by registry entry.</p>
  <h3>4.2.1a PO Forms Report - Portrait Format</h3>
  <p>By default, the PO prints in landscape mode. This option will allow it to print in portrait orientation, and will fit in most typical window envelopes when folded. The following registry option enables the portrait format:</p>
  <p>
    <font style="font-weight: bold;">Registry Id:</font> sys-printer-dialog-rpofrm
  </p>
  <p>
    <font style="font-weight: bold;">Setting Key: </font>orientation <font style="font-weight: bold;">Setting Value:</font> 1
  </p>
  <p style="margin-left: 48px;"><span style="font-weight: bold;">Important Note on Graphics:</span><br/>
    <span style="font-weight: normal;">If your company changes to the portrait format from landscape you will need to have new graphics supporting the change in place. The existing landscape graphics should NOT be removed (to supported previously archived reports). The new portrait graphics should have a different name, and the bitmaps option of the sys-report-rpofrm registry should be updated with the new graphics name at the same time when the registry enabling the portrait format is enabled</span>
  </p>
  <h3>4.2.1b PO Forms Report - Landscape Format</h3>
  <p>From 9.1.611.058d and up, a new runtime option &quot;Show Estimated Tax&quot; has been added to the SAMPro Purchase Order. When this option is selected, the fields as defined below will display on the standard landscape Purchase Order. This will also be added to the Purchase Order when printed via the web (standard and SubPO) to ensure compatibility.  <br/>
    If the Show Estimated Tax box is checked:</p>
  <p>1. A line for &quot;Subtotal&quot; will label the current total value (without estimated Tax).</p>
  <p>2. Added a new line for Estimated Tax.  Estimated Tax is defined as the sum of the following fields:<br/>
    Inventory Child Tab = prchseordrlst_tx_cst<br/>
    General Child Tab = prchseordrlstgn_tx_cst<br/>
    Subcontractor Child Tab = prchseordrlstsb_tx_cst<br/>
    Important: The Estimated Tax will only appear on the PO if the Tax Group is completed in the PO header.<br/>
    3. If the Show Estimated Tax box is selected, a line labeled &quot;Grand Total&quot; will also be printed. This is defined as the subtotal prices + total estimated taxes<br/>
    NOTE: Portrait PO’s<br/>
    If your system is set up to print SAMPro PO’s in portrait, the Show Estimated Tax option will appear, but will be ignored when the PO is run in this release.</p>
  <h3><span style="font-weight: bold;">4.2.2 PO Reorder Advice Report</span></h3>
  <p>This report now gets Security from Location/GL Entity/Company/Security links if Intercompany is enabled. Previously the report would always try to pull the Security from the Location. This system report does not need to be imported.</p>
  <h2>4.3 Purchase Order</h2>
  <p>Previously for a specific user, the tax was included in average cost stopped being accurate after 2019. As a result of the bug, their inventory item average costs are understated by the 8% tax. This update corrects this defect. </p>
  <p>Previously, the markup price on both the Inventory and General tabs for purchased items was calculated on cost without Use tax when the Income Receipts Journal is used to receive items. If the items are received directly on the Purchase Order, the markup is correctly calculated on cost with use tax. This update corrects this defect. </p>
  <p>Previously, when a user ran the Quote Approval Wizard for a quote where a PO needs to be generated, it would result in an error. This update corrects that defect.</p>
  <p>This update prevents users from saving a Purchase Order if a tab mismatch has occurred on the page. This is done to prevent the user from saving data with an error in it, forcing the user to reload the tab and re-enter data.</p>
  <p>This update displays the Sales Tax Group from the Job in the PO&#39;s header or the Work Order&#39;s Job from the PO header. This allows users to easily view their tax group if needed.<br/>

  <p>This release eliminates a sporadic error when saving a PO when Unvouchered A/P box is flagged in the Accounting Period and receipts are made directly on the PO.</p>
  <p style="margin-left: 8px;">When a PO record is loaded or saved, the Job Cost Category will be cleared if a Job is NOT specified on a detail line. This release also tightens Job Cost Category / Job validation.</p>
  <p>This release corrects sporadic Tab Mismatch errors encountered when a PO was created or edited  for a foreign currency Vendor (e.g., Currency Id set in the Vendor record).</p>
  <h3>4.3.0 Replaced PO Warning</h3>
  <p>The user is now warned when the user first accesses a Purchase Order which has been replaced by one with a higher &#39;tack&#39; number. This warning is designed to prevent the user from wasting time by attempting to make changes to a journal entry record which cannot be saved because it has already been replaced.  For example, if Purchase Orders are used as controlled documents, the following warning would appear:</p>
  <p style="margin-left: 48px;">WARNING: Purchase Order 123456 has been replaced by 123456-01.</p>
  <p style="margin-left: 48px;">This record cannot be changed.</p>
  <p style="margin-left: 8px;">See Customer Note 4.1.2 for a registry to disable this warning globally or by individual viewer.</p>
  <h3>4.3.1 Purchase Order Inventory Tab</h3>
  <p><span style="font-weight: bold;">New Field Magnify View: Billable Quantity</span><br/>
    This field supports the scenario where a TechAnywhere technician changes the Billable Quantity of an item so that it will be correctly imported into the Work Order. By default this field is set from the Job Quantity Ordered.  Previously, the Billable Quantity always defaulted from the Job Quantity Ordered when the Work Order&#39;s Import Costs button was clicked.</p>
  <p><span style="font-weight: bold;">Changed Field: Cost Category</span><br/>
    This field now supports enhanced filtering provided by the Cost Code&#39;s Job Cost Category Usage Filter. Cost Categories are validated (relative to Cost Codes) during data entry upon leaving the Cost Category Id field.  The full relationship is validated again when leaving a child line or saving a record.</p>

  <p><span style="font-weight: bold;">New Field  (click Magnify) - Order Details:</span><br/>
    This display-only field shows data retrieved from the PO Details table generated by a custom PO Analytic. Validation prevents changes to PO-SUB lines that originated in the PO Analytic and have details stored in the PO Detail table.</p>
  <h3>4.3.4 Subcontractor Tab Taxes</h3>
  <p>In this release, the Tax Cost (if applicable) is successfully recomputed when the C.O. Amount is changed on an existing line.</p>
  <p style="font-weight: bold; margin-left: 8px;">Changed Fields: Tax Cost  - Tax Group Id<br/>
    <span style="font-weight: normal;">If a Tax Group flagged as Job Cost is specified on the Purchase Order header, it will now be used to calculate the Tax Cost on the Subcontractor tab: the committed cost will include the tax.  When the AP journal is recorded, the tax shown in the Subcontractor will be job costed on top of the value, and would debit the expense account and credit the tax payable account. In previous releases, this functionality was only supported on the Inventory and General tabs, and the PO header Job&#39;s (or Work Order&#39;s Job) Tax Group was incorrectly referenced on the Subcontractor tab.</span>
  </p>
  <h3>4.3.5 Purchase Order List</h3>
  <p>A new sort order, PurchaseOrderByJobIDByDescription has been added.  The Job Id will only appear in the Job Id column if it is completed on the Purchase Order Main. No attempt is made to derive the Job Id from the Work Order (if completed) in the PO header.</p>
  <p style="font-weight: bold; margin-left: 8px;"><span style="font-weight: normal;">The PO&#39;s &quot;ordered by&quot; field has been added to the sort option PurchaseOrderByVendorAlphaByIdByDescription after the status column.</span> </p>
  <h3>4.3.6 Work Order Sub/PO NTE Warning</h3>
  <p>In previous releases, If the Work Order&#39;s Sub NTE field was completed, a warning was displayed if <span style="font-weight: bold;">any</span> of the actual / committed costs on the WO exceeded the Sub NTE. In this release, the message will only be displayed if actual and committed costs associated with PO&#39;s (of any kind) exceed the Work Order&#39;s Sub/PO NTE value. The message itself has been changed to reflect this:</p>
  <p style="margin-left: 48px;">WARNING:  Work Order has a Sub/PO NTE amount of $ #####<br/>
    This limit is exceeded by its to-date PO costs (actual+committments) of $ #####</p>
  <h3>4.3.7 Purchase Order Main Tab</h3>
  <p><span style="font-weight: bold;">Removed Button:</span> <img alt="" border="0" src="assets/images/SKIN1_Receive1.bmp" style="border: none;"/></p>
  <p>This top button-bar icon opened the Inventory Receipts Journal with the PO Id specified. It has been replaced by a Main tab button with enhanced functionality.</p>
  <p><span style="font-weight: bold;">New Button:</span><img alt="" border="0" src="assets/images/RecordReceipt.bmp" style="border: none;"/></p>
  <p>Click the Record Receipt Transaction button to open the Inventory Receipts Journal to receive the items on this Purchase Order. If any items are available for receipt, the system will prompt: &quot;Do you want to fully receive all ordered items?&quot;</p>
  <p style="margin-left: 48px;">Click Yes to auto-receive all items that have not yet been received, the system will receive the items, save the Inventory Receipt, and return to the Purchase Order.</p>
  <p style="margin-left: 48px;">Click No if you wish to manually received the items. You will need to save the receipt manually; you will then be returned to the Purchase Order.</p>
  <p style="margin-left: 8px;">Note that the List button is disabled when the Inventory Receipt is accessed via the PO&#39;s Record Receipt TRX button. This validation prevents a runtime error when the Inventory Receipt is accessed in this special manner. Note that existing Inventory Receipts may also be accessed via the PO&#39;s IMH tab.  </p>
  <h3>4.3.8 SubAnywhere PO Processing</h3>
  <p>Version 9.1.611.056 release correctly prevents PO level cancellation of the PO when a subcontractor line has been vouchered / partially vouchered. This validation was previously only supported for PO&#39;s with received or vouchered Inventory or General lines, not dollar-based (subcontractor) PO&#39;s.</p>
  <p style="margin-left: 8px;">Previous releases added consistency to whether or not Subcontractor PO&#39;s are set to released based on the presence or absence of a password in a tech record flagged as Web Access - Subcontractor and Remote Devise Tab - none. If the Password is set in the Subcontractor Tech record, the PO should be set to Unreleased. Previously only PO&#39;s generated in New Call were handled correctly.  In this release, Subcontractor PO&#39;s generated from selecting a Subcontractor in TechFinder, and from the Work Order, are also set to Unreleased.</p>
  <h3><span style="font-weight: bold;">4.3.9 Purchase Order - IMH Tab</span></h3>
  <p style="margin-left: 8px;">Version 9.1.611.056 supports opening the IMH record source (e.g., AP Journal, Inventory Receipts) listed on this tab. Double-click on a line to open the record.</p>
  <h2><span style="font-weight: bold;">4.4 Start Close Open POs</span> </h2>
  <p style="margin-left: 8px;">This release corrects a problem where this function did not always apply Security to the history reversals lines generated by this function.</p>
  <p style="margin-left: 8px;">This function currently does not support scenarios where a PO has receipts entered in the Inventory Receipts Journal viewer; do so resulted in data being incorrectly updated. In this release, this function now automatically excludes POs that have one or more lines with net IRJ receipts &lt;&gt; zero in case it is inadvertently run where receipts are not exclusively made on the PO.</p>
  <h2>4.5 Start Generate Purchase Order</h2>
  <p>This function no longer allows you to create POs for Inactive Vendors. In this release, a list of ineligible Vendors and a message will be displayed when the Checklist appears:</p>
  <p>The following vendors are inactive,therefore ineligible for Purchase Order creation.</p>
  <p>Vendor 1</p>
  <p>Vendor 2 ....</p>
  <p>In order to complete the Generate Purchase Orders  function, all Inactive Vendors must be removed as Primary Vendors on any of the Inventory Items listed in the Checklist. If a Vendor was marked Inactive in error, switching them back to Active will allow the function to be run.</p>
  <h3>4.5.1 Start Generate Purchase Orders - Inventory Cost Includes Tax</h3>
  <p style="margin-left: 8px;">This release resolves consistency issues for stock PO&#39;s generated via Start Generate PO versus stock PO&#39;s created manually under the following scenario:</p>
  <p style="margin-left: 48px;">The global (sys-ffv-global-settings) registry has the option InventoryCostIncludesTax=True</p>
  <p style="margin-left: 48px;">Vendor&#39;s Sales Tax Group has tax authority set to Job Cost</p>
  <p style="margin-left: 48px;">Inventory group has cost category set to material</p>
  <p style="margin-left: 48px;">Inventory item has Default Vendor</p>
  <p style="margin-left: 8px;">Creating a PO manually creates a tax cost to the line marked as a tax type of prepaid. Previously, the auto-generated PO has no tax cost and a tax type of n/a.  In this release, Start Generate Purchase Orders also results in Tax Costs going to Inventory and a tax type of prepaid given the above settings.</p>
  <p style="margin-left: 8px;">This release also corrects the inconsistency when the InventoryCostIncludesTax=True registry is set but a Tax Group is NOT in the Vendor record. In this case, manually adding a stock PO and auto-generating one both set the Tax Type Id to (space) n/a.</p>
  <h1>5 Inventory</h1>
  <h2>5.1 Inventory Registries</h2>
  <h5>5.1.1 Inventory Adjustments: Job Cost Burden Applied to Inventory Costs</h5>
  <p>SAMPro now provides for an option job cost burden to be applied to inventory costs when Inventory Adjustment Journal transactions are generated. To do so, the Burden Rate % field would be completed in one or both of the following places:</p>
  <p style="margin-left: 48px;">In the Inventory Item record</p>
  <p style="margin-left: 48px;">In the Location Rate record (the Apply Location Burden field must be flagged in the applicable Inventory Item Groups)</p>
  <p style="margin-left: 8px;">In addition, the following registry entry is required to specify the income account to be credited with the burden.</p>
  <p><span style="font-weight: bold;">Registry Id:</span> sys-viewer-vinvntryadjstmnt</p>
  <p><span style="font-weight: bold;">Setting Key:</span> AppliedBurdenGLAccountId   <span style="font-weight: bold;">Setting Value:</span> <span style="font-style: italic;">gl account id</span></p>
  <p>where the Setting Value specifies the GL Income Account that will be credited with the applied burden.</p>
  <h3>5.1.1a  Registry to Error or Warn if a Completed or Cancelled Work Order is Selected</h3>
  <p>This registry option enables the user to either warn or error if the Work Order they select is closed (Date Closed is set)  and/or has an Escalation Status of Cancelled. This functionality is supported in the Inventory Adjustment Viewer as well as in the Fill Lines Wizard (when the Next button is clicked).</p>
  <p><span style="font-weight: bold;">Id:</span> sys-viewer-vinvntryadjstmnt</p>
  <p><span style="font-weight: bold;">Setting Key:</span> ValidateWODateClosed   <span style="font-weight: bold;">Setting Value:</span> error or warning</p>
  <p>Note that the default value is no validation. Warning will warn the user while error prevents the use of the Work Order.</p>
  <h3>5.1.2  Registry to Limit Writing to Inventory Vendor Tab to Purchasing Agents</h3>
  <p><span style="font-weight: bold;">Registry  Id:</span> sys-viewer-vinvntryitm</p>
  <p><span style="font-weight: bold;">Setting Key:</span> AllowPriceChangesOnlyByPurchaseAgents</p>
  <p><span style="font-weight: bold;">Setting Value:</span> true   (default false)</p>
  <p>When the above registry is enabled, the following changes to default behavior will be in effect:</p>
  <p style="margin-left: 48px;"> <span style="text-decoration: underline; ">Inventory Item Viewer Vendors Tab</span></p>
  <p style="margin-left: 88px;">Only Users flagged as Purchasing Agents are allowed to directly alter the Price field. When a change is made, a secure note will be created, and the Change Date and User Id on the Detail view will be update</p>
  <p style="margin-left: 88px;">Users NOT flagged as Purchasing Agents are not allowed to delete lines, add lines, or insert with copy.  They are allowed to update the Description filed.</p>
  <p style="margin-left: 48px; text-decoration: underline; ">Purchase Order Viewer</p>
  <p style="margin-left: 88px;">When this registry is enabled, the Purchase Order will no longer update the Price field on existing line on the Inventory Item&#39;s Vendors Tab. When buying an Item from a Vendor for the first time, the PO viewer allows the creation of a new line on the Inventory Item Vendor tab, including the Price field.</p>
  <p style="margin-left: 88px;">This functionality is supported for PO&#39;s created from the Purchase Order viewer, QuoteMaster / Quote Manager, Start Generate Purchase Orders, and TechAnywhere.</p>
  <p style="margin-left: 48px; text-decoration: underline; ">AP Journal Viewer</p>
  <p style="margin-left: 88px;">When this registry is enabled, the AP Journal will no longer update the Price field on the Inventory Item&#39;s Vendors Tab.</p>
  <h3>5.1.3 Compute Corporate Metrics Registry to Refine Turns Calculation</h3>
  <p>The following registry may be used to refine the Compute Corporate Metrics logic so that so that if an item’s on-hand quantity is &lt;=0 AND the transaction will reduce the quantity on hand further, the transaction is NOT used in the turns calculation. This change is incorporated in both the Inventory and Inventory By Location computations.</p>
  <p><span style="font-weight: bold;">Id:</span> sys-corporate-metrics</p>
  <p><span style="font-weight: bold;">Setting Key:</span>  Turns-IncludePositiveOnHandOnly   <span style="font-weight: bold;">Setting Value:</span> Yes  (default No)</p>
  <p>Any value beginning with &#39;Y&#39; or &#39;T&#39; (upper or lower case) will turn this option on.</p>
  <h3>5.1.4 Inventory Receipt Journal Registry to Deny Over Receiving of Stock Items</h3>
  <p>The over-receiving &#39;feature&#39; for items purchased to Stock was added expressly to eliminate the requirement that the PO line had to be changed to match the over-receipt before the IRJ could be recorded. The IRJ posting was made smart enough to make the Qty On Order equal zero in this circumstance.  Thus, the user had no reason to go back and sync the PO Qty Ordered with the IRJ Qty Received. Note that over-receiving it NOT allowed on items purchased to jobs.</p>
  <p>However, some users may prefer to not allow the over-receipt of stock items. The following registry may be implemented to allow the current warning on the over-receipt to be changed to an error.</p>
  <p><span style="font-weight: bold;">Registry Id:</span> sys-viewer-vinvntryrcpt</p>
  <p><span style="font-weight: bold;">Setting Key:</span> AllowOverReceiving   <span style="font-weight: bold;">Setting Value:</span>  false  (true is default)</p>
  <h3>5.1.5 Registry to Create Warnings for Exceeding Quantity / Unit Cost Thresholds in Inventory Adjustments.</h3>
  <p><span style="font-weight: bold;">Id:</span> sys-viewer-vinvntryadjstmnt  </p>
  <p><span style="font-weight: bold;">Setting Key:</span> QuantityNotToExceed   <span style="font-weight: bold;">Setting Value:</span> <span style="font-style: italic;">threshold quantity</span></p>
  <p>When this option is set and the quantity entered exceeds the value,  a warning will display: &#39;Warning: Quantity entered exceeds limit entered in Registry&#39;</p>
  <p><span style="font-weight: bold;">Setting Key:</span> UnitCostNotToExceed   <span style="font-weight: bold;">Setting Value:</span> <span style="font-style: italic;">threshold cost</span></p>
  <p>When this option is set and the unit cost manually entered exceeds the threshold cost value a warning will display: &#39;Warning: Unit Cost entered exceeds limit entered in Registry.&#39;</p>
  <h2>5.2 Inventory Reports</h2>
  <h3>5.2.1 Inventory Receipt Journal - Report Purchasing Packing Slip</h3>
  <p>New Button: <img alt="" border="0" src="assets/images/PrintPackingSlip.bmp" style="border: none;"/></p>
  <p>This button calls a new report, Report Purchasing Packing Slip (RPOPCKNGSLP.rpt). Note that this report must be installed and assigned to the appropriate user groups.</p>
  <p>The report shows received items from the purchase order deriving it&#39;s data from the inventory receipts journal. If the report is launched from the Inventory Receipt Journal, the input fields Beginning Date / Ending Date and Inventory Receipt Id be automatically completed by the system.  This portrait-style report includes space for a company bitmap (1.25&quot; high by 5.25&quot; wide_. The report includes details such as the Purchase Order Id, Work Order or Job Id (from the PO Main tab Site Name/Address, Date Received. All items received are listed with their quantities received and item description.</p>
  <p>Previously in the User Groups record, when filtering to a smaller subset of items and then saving, only the “yes” for the items in the filtered list would save and everything outside of that reverted from “yes” to “no.” This update corrects this defect. </p>
  <h3>5.2.2 Stock Status Report</h3>
  <p>In previous releases, the Report Stock Status excluded entries for locations that have a zero on hand amount (imhstry_qntty_on_hnd - imhstry_qntty_rcvd_jb). As an example, if 0 were on hand but 2 on order for stock, it did not show on the report. In this release, if any of the following columns that are on the report have values that could affect the On Hand amount, then the Location should be shown: On-Hand, Allocated, Cust BO, Shop BO, Reorder and On-Order. Note that this is a system report and does not need to be installed in the system.</p>
  <p>This release corrects a minor rounding problem resulting in the sum of individual Location Totals not adding up to All Reported Locations Total. This system report does not need to be imported.</p>
  <h2>5.3 Inventory Adjustment Journal</h2>
  <p>This update adds the following popup warning for when a quantity picked is greater than the on-hand quantity to COP Pick Tickets: &quot;Warning: The quantity picked is greater than the quantity ordered. Press OK to continue.&quot;<br/>
    For lot-controlled inventory items, if the quantity picked is greater than the quantity available in the specified lot number, a pop-up warning appears: &quot;The quantity picked exceeds the quantity available in the specified lot number. Press OK to continue.&quot;</p>
  <p>Validation has been added that ensures that the GL Entities in the From &amp; To lines are for the same company in Adjustment type entries. Validation also checks that the Job/Location entity matches the GL Entity in the From &amp; To lines for Adjustment type entries. This validation was previously added to Loc-to-Loc; Loc-to-Job; Job-to-Loc and Job-to-Job transaction in version 9.1.611.047.</p>
  <p>This release properly validates that the From GL Entity is required for Intercompany installations. This corrects an issue where the Security was not always written to IM History on Inventory Adjustments.</p>
  <p>This release corrects issues with unbalanced GL entries: extended costs are now correctly rounded instead of being truncated.</p>
  <p>When Location adjustments are edited, the GL Account and Entity from the Inventory Item&#39;s Group are updated if needed when the Inventory Item is changed.</p>
  <p><span style="font-weight:bold;">IM Adjustments Journal viewer: </span><br/>
    Version 9.1.611.059 and up requires the “from” location field to be completed and does not allow any data entered in the job or work order fields. In previous releases, the IM Adjustment Transaction Type did not require a “from” location and allowed data to be entered in the job or work order fields. </p>
  <h3>5.3.1 Optional Job Cost Burden Applied to Inventory Costs</h3>
  <p>SAMPro now provides for an option job cost burden to be applied to inventory costs when Inventory Adjustment Journal transactions are generated. A registry entry (see Customer Note 5.1.1) as required to specify the income account to be credited with the burden.</p>
  <p>This functionality is currently supported by the following functions and processes that emulate the journal:</p>
  <p style="margin-left: 48px;">Fill Lines Wizard (button in IM Adjustments Journal parent)</p>
  <p style="margin-left: 48px;">Start Work Order Material Pickup</p>
  <p style="margin-left: 48px;">Start Import Inventory Adjustments (custom)</p>
  <p style="margin-left: 8px;">This functionality will be extended to other records/functions in a future release.</p>
  <p style="margin-left: 8px;"><span style="font-weight: bold;">New Field: Material Burden Unit Cost</span><br/>
    This display-only field will be calculated by the system when the adjustment involves a Job transfer and</p>
  <p style="margin-left: 48px;">The Inventory Item and/or Location has the Burden Rate % field set</p>
  <p style="margin-left: 48px;">The Inventory Item&#39;s Inventory Group has the Apply Location Burden? field checked (and the Location&#39;s Burden Rate % field is set)</p>
  <p style="margin-left: 8px;">The calculated unit burden is added to the inventory unit cost for Job History, debits COS and credits the registry set income account (see registry below) when the Inventory Adjustment Journal entry is recorded.</p>
  <h3>5.3.2  Transfer From / Transfer To Lines</h3>
  <p><span style="font-weight: bold;">Changed Field: Cost Category</span><br/>
    This field now supports enhanced filtering provided by the Cost Code&#39;s Job Cost Category Usage Filter. Cost Categories are validated (relative to Cost Codes) during data entry upon leaving the Cost Category Id field.  The full relationship is validated again when leaving a child line or saving a record.</p>
  <p>Cost Categories with a Selection Cost Type of Equipment or Material are now supported.</p>

  <h2>5.4 Inventory Item Record</h2>
  <h3>5.4.1 Pricing/Costing Tab</h3>
  <p><span style="font-weight: bold;">Changed Field: Unit Cost Average</span><br/>
    This release computes an Item&#39;s overall Average Unit Cost as the Weighted Average of each Location&#39;s Average Unit Cost. The Average Unit Cost for each Location that has quantity on hand &gt; zero will be included; the system will then compute the weighted Average Unit Cost for all Locations. Obsolete Locations cannot be excluded because the date a Location became obsolete is not known.  It is the user&#39;s responsibility to clear on hand balances for all Items from each obsolete Location. Previously, the Inventory Item Average Unit Cost was determined via a running total, which could lead to inaccurate results if the cost was entered incorrectly in one or more locations at some point.</p>
  <p><span style="font-weight: bold;">New Field: Burden Rate %</span><br/>
    If this field is completed, it will be will be used to calculate the Unit Burden Cost in Job History when an Inventory Adjustment Journal entry is created which involves a Job / WO transfer.  If a Burden Rate % is specified in both the Inventory Item and Location Record, the cumulative Burden Rate total will be applied. A registry entry (Customer Note 5.1.1) specifies the income account to be credited.</p>
  <h3>5.4.2 Locations Tab</h3>
  <p><span style="font-weight: bold;">New Field - Obsolete:</span><br/>
    Obsolete Locations are now displayed at the bottom of the Inventory Item Location tab. The Obsolete flag has been added as a column on the far right of the tab.</p>
  <h3>5.4.2.a Locations Tab</h3>
  <p style="font-weight: bold;">Changed Fields: Average Cost - Last Cost</p>
  <p>In previous releases, loading the Inventory Item viewer suffered poor performance for items that had a history for many Locations.  This was the result of computing the Last and Average Cost for presentation on the Location tab.  </p>
  <p>By default  the Average and Last Cost calculation is no longer applied when loading the viewer. To improve performance, the Average and Last Cost will only be calculated on each line when clicking &quot;Show Computation&quot; on the detail view.  The Average and Last Cost columns will display as &quot;Needs Compute&quot; until they are individually computed.</p>
  <p>Note that the overall costing information for the Inventory Item is displayed on the Pricing/Costing tab as usual.</p>
  <p>The following registry may be enabled to display the Average and Last Costs on the Location tab as in previous releases:</p>
  <p><span style="font-weight: bold;">Id:</span> sys-viewer-vinvntryitm</p>
  <p><span style="font-weight: bold;">Setting Key:</span> DelayInvItmAvgLastCost   <span style="font-weight: bold;">Setting Key:</span> false (default true)</p>
  <h3>5.4.3 Inventory Item List View</h3>
  <p>The Inventory Item&#39;s Extended Description columns have been added to the InventoryItemByGroupByIDByExtendedName Inventory Item list.</p>
  <p>A saved range can be added to enable the user to search on the first Extended Description column: sql=(invntryitm_dscrptn_extndd like &#39;%text%&#39;)</p>
  <h3><span style="font-weight: bold;">5.4.4 BOM Tab</span></h3>
  <p>A CVS file is generated by the BOM-CVS button. The column heading for the Master Inventory Item Description has been changed from &quot;Description&quot; to &quot;MasterDescription&quot; to avoid conflict with the Component Inventory Item Descriptions which also has a column heading of &quot;Description&quot;.</p>
  <h3>5.4.5 Inventory Item Purchasing tab</h3>
  <p><span style="font-weight: bold;">Changed Field - Vendor Id:</span>  <br/>
    The user is now warned &quot;Purchase Orders cannot be created for Inactive Vendors&quot; if an Inactive Vendor is referenced. The user will not be able to save the record if the Vendor they just selected is Inactive.</p>
  <p><span style="font-weight: bold;">New Field: Vendor Status</span><br/>
    The Vendor Status (Active, Inactive or Mail List) is now displayed to the right of the Vendor Id.</p>
  <h3>5.4.6 Inventory Item Availability Tab</h3>
  <p>Previously when processing a Physical Count, if the quantity for a Lot Controlled Item needed adjusting (up or down), the system would throw a message that the Quantity for Serialized Inventory cannot be greater than 1 and would not let the user continue or leave the field or Save the record. User would have to refresh the viewer and then lose all other quantity adjustments entered.  Now the Physical Count viewer allows for the adjustment of Lot Controlled quantities. </p>
  <p>Previously when a user would adjust the on-hand inventory below -1,000,000, it would cause an error. This update corrects this defect.</p>
  <p>The Security Id has been added to the Inventory Item Availability child tab that queries IMH and presents totals by Location for the Item in the viewer to support the use of Security (including Intercompany) and identify the items available for Fill Backorders.</p>
  <h3>5.4.7 Inventory Item Purchases Tab</h3>
  <p><span>In previous releases, if a Vendor&#39;s Id/Name were changed, the Inventory Purchases tab continues to display the original values written to history. In this release, this tab has been refined to display the Vendor Id and Name as it is currently set. </span></p>
  <h2>5.5 Inventory Group</h2>
  <h3>5.5.1 Job Cost Burden</h3>
  <p><span style="font-weight: bold;">New Field: Apply Location Burden?</span><br/>
    If this field is checked, the Burden Rate % in the Location record will be used to calculate the Unit Burden Cost in Job History when an Inventory Adjustment Journal entry is created which involves a Job / WO transfer. Note that if  a Burden Rate % is specified in both the Inventory Item and Location Record, the cumulative Burden Rate total will be applied. A registry entry (Customer Note 5.1.1) specifies the income account to be credited.</p>
  <h3>5.6.1 Cost Category</h3>
  <p>A Cost Category with the Selection Cost Type of Equipment is now supported.</p>

  <h2>5.6 Location Record</h2>
  <p><span style="font-weight: bold;">Import Stock Levels:</span><br/>
    When the Import Stock Levels button is clicked, the system validates that a valid Location Id is selected.  The user may double-click on the field to select an Id.</p>
  <p><span style="font-weight: bold;">LocationItems Tab</span><br/>
    The LocationItem tab has been repositioned as a parent tab so that the information on this tab is only assembled/displayed when the tab is clicked. This enhances performance when the user only wishes to access / edit the Main tab when the Location includes a very large number of items.</p>
  <h3>5.6.1 Job Cost Burden</h3>
  <p><span style="font-weight: bold;">New Field: Burden Rate %</span><br/>
    If this field is completed AND the Apply Location Burden flag is checked in the Inventory Group, it will be will be used to calculate the Unit Burden Cost in Job History when an Inventory Adjustment Journal entry is created which involves a Job / WO transfer.  Note that if  a Burden Rate % is specified in both the Inventory Item and Location Record, the cumulative Burden Rate total will be applied. A registry entry (Customer Note 5.1.1) specifies the income account to be credited.</p>
  <h3>5.6.2 Special Handling of Obsolete Locations</h3>
  <p><span style="font-weight: bold;">Changed Field - Obsolete?</span><br/>
    In addition to the standard references checking, when a user flags the Obsolete field and saves the record, the system will also check to see if there are any references to this Location exist on the Inventory Item&#39;s Locations tab. If Inventory Item Tab entries for this Location are found with 0 quantities (On Hand, On Order, Cust BO, Shop BO, Pick and Rejected) the system will ask if you wish to remove these entries:</p>
  <p style="margin-left: 48px;">&#39;Would you like to remove ** items with zero quantities for this Location from the Inventory Item&#39;&#39;s Locations tab?&#39;</p>
  <p>If you click Yes these lines will be removed; clicking No retains the Inventory Location lines.</p>
  <p> </p>
  <h2>5.7 Inventory Receipts Journal</h2>
  <p>Previously, the unit price for inventory items marked as “Use Price Levels with valid Unit Prices” were being changed to cost times markup/multiplier/margin when received for a Purchase Order using the Inventory receipt journal, which had a direct work order attachment. When the inventory receipt journal was used to receive the items from the PO, the job rate schedule pricing method was used to calculate the unit price (revenue) for the work order when the item’s unit pricing should be used.This only affected builds 9.1.611.057a to 9.1.611.061d. This update corrects this defect. </p>
  <p>Version 9.1.611.056 corrects an issue with missing revenue from PO-GEN lines on Job-based PO&#39;s. The Billable quantity is now set from the Job quantity received. In addition, if the global registry InventoryCostIncludesTax is enabled, the system now correctly includes prepaid - use tax when calculating markup on General lines received in the Inventory Receipts Journal.</p>
  <p style="margin-left: 8px;">Prior to this correction, if a PO line description received an edit during Inventory Receipt Journal recording the quantity received evaluation could get confused and prevent &quot;reversal&quot; or undoing of the transaction.</p>
  <p style="margin-left: 8px;">The List button is disabled when the Inventory Receipt is accessed via the PO&#39;s Record Receipt TRX button. This validation prevents a runtime error when the Inventory Receipt is accessed in this special manner. Note that existing Inventory Receipts may now be accessed via the PO&#39;s IMH tab.   </p>
  <p><span style="font-weight: bold;">Auto Set Quantity Received Button:</span> The use of this button is denied if one or more items are flagged as Serialized since the validation to require a serial number is not supported. If any serialized lines are detected, the error message will indicate which lines refer to serialized items.</p>
  <p>This release corrects an issue where some general items not referencing an Other Rate wrote to Job History with Labor as the jchstry_type if the Auto Set Quantity Received button was used.</p>
  <p>This release refines the precision in used in cost calculations to correct a problem where received POs could not close at AP voucher due to pennies left committed.</p>
  <p><span style="font-weight: bold;">Important:</span> Un-receipted lines are no longer displayed to enforce the requirement that a new Inventory Receipt entry must be created to re-receipt items.</p>
  <p>This release corrects a sporadic Tab Mismatch error receiving quantities via the Auto Set Qty Rec&#39;d  button.</p>
  <p>A warning is now displayed when the user first accesses a Journal entry which has been replaced by one with a higher &#39;tack&#39; number. This warning is designed to prevent the user from wasting time by attempting to make changes to a journal entry record which cannot be saved because it has already been replaced. See Customer Note 1.1.2 for a registry to disable this warning globally or by individual viewer.</p>
  <p style="font-weight: bold;">Changed Field: Cost Category</p>
  <p>The Job Cost Category validation now allows Equipment Selection Cost Types. The Cost Category field is display-only and is set from the Purchase Order.</p>

  <p>1. Access the View Lot Master record for the serialized item to be re-received.</p>
  <p style="margin-left: 48px;">Verify that the Quantity on Hand = 0.</p>
  <p style="margin-left: 48px;">Change the Lot Status to Reuse S/N.</p>
  <p style="margin-left: 48px;">Save the record.</p>
  <p>2. Create a new Inventory Receipt entry to re-receive the item. You will be warned that the serial number already existed but you will be allowed to save the Inventory Receipt.</p>

  <h2>5.8 Start Import IM Adjustments</h2>
  <h3>Purpose:</h3>
  <p>Used to import Inventory Adjustment entries from a Database table or a csv file. The import file can be created by a custom barcode program that writes to a database table or manually entered in a spreadsheet.  </p>
  <h3>Usage:</h3>
  <p>When this function is run, the date effective (from the .cvs file or database table) is used to get a valid Accounting Period which includes that date. If no valid Accounting Period is found,  an error message &#39;Effective date has no valid Accounting Period&#39; is displayed and the adjustment will be rejected.</p>
  <h3>Range Screen:</h3>
  <p style="font-weight: bold;">Import From: Database - Text CSV File</p>
  <p>Choose whether you will be importing from a database table or a csv file.</p>
  <p style="margin-left: 48px;">If you choose to import from a table, the checklist will appear with available (unposted) transactions.</p>
  <p style="margin-left: 48px;">If you choose to import from a csv file, you will browse and choose the file and the checklist will appear.</p>
  <p>Select the transactions to be posted and hit Go.</p>
  <p>A message will display when the import is complete.  </p>
  <p style="margin-left: 48px;">If there are failed transactions, a file containing those transactions will be created and the location of the file will be displayed in a message box.  The Email-to address define in the registry will also receive an email.  A user needs to go to that file and fix the errors which will be noted in the file.</p>
  <p style="margin-left: 48px;">The user should then run the manual function selecting the csv file, and browse to and choose the fixed file.</p>
  <p>Start Import IM Adjustments (Automated) may be used to run this function as a scheduled event:  </p>
  <h3>Spreadsheet Format:</h3>
  <p>The import expects a header row; the file must be comma delimited. The specifications are as follows:</p>
  <p style="margin-left: 48px;">Date - date(10) (if blank today&#39;s date) format (YYYY-MM-DD)<br/>

  <h2>5.10 Inventory Adjustments Journal</h2>
  <p>Additional validation has been added to this viewer to prevent incorrectly entered &#39;Adjustment&#39; transaction types from generating out of balance GL and/or Job History entries.</p>
  <p>When a line is copied and the Inventory Id is changed, the Tax Cost will be re-evaluated for Use Tax jobs.  Previously, the Tax Cost was not recomputed from the line it was copied from.</p>
  <p>This release corrects a rounding issue that caused the amount expensed/relieved from inventory to differ from Intercompany transactions.</p>
  <p>This function now supports the &#39;creation&#39; of serialized item records (via an Adjustment entry) for Intercompany users.  </p>
  <p>This release corrects posting to GLH if single company Intercompany is enabled. Previously, this posting was only correct if the AppliedBurdenGLAccountId was enabled. <span style="font-weight: bold;"> </span></p>
  <h3>5.10.1 Adding Serial Items</h3>
  <p>This release corrects the validation so that Serial Numbers can be added from an Adjustment both for Intercompany (where the &quot;To&quot; line&#39;s GL Entity is completed) and non-Intercompany (where the GL Entity should be blank). Note that the following registry must be enabled to allowed the addition of serial items:</p>
  <p><span style="font-weight: bold;">Id:</span> sys-viewer-vinvntryadjstmnt</p>
  <p><span style="font-weight: bold;">Setting Key:</span> CreateNewSerialNumber  <span style="font-weight: bold;">Setting Value:</span> true</p>
  <p>When this registry is enabled, the adjustment would be made with the Location on the &#39;To&#39; line completed. The GL Entity would be required on the &#39;To&#39; line if Intercompany was enabled.   </p>
  <p>Note that the following procedure must be used to create the Item.</p>
  <p>1.Enter the Period Id and Effective Date, and set the Entry Type to ‘Adjustment’.<br/>
    2. Enter the Inventory Item Id of the serialized item.<br/>
    3. If the number does not exist, click Yes to create it.<br/>
    4. Enter a Quantity of 1 and the appropriate Unit Cost.<br/>
    5. Select the ‘To’ Location where you want the new Serial item to be created. The GL Entity should default for Intercompany installations; the GL Account must NOT be entered.<br/>
    6. When you save the journal entry, the new item will be available at that Location.</p>
  <h3>5.10.2 Intercompany Validation</h3>
  <p>Validation has been added that ensures that the GL Entities in the From &amp; To lines are for the same company in Adjustment type entries. Validation also checks that the Job/Location entity matches the GL Entity in the From &amp; To lines for Adjustment type entries. This validation was previously added to Loc-to-Loc; Loc-to-Job; Job-to-Loc and Job-to-Job transaction in version 9.1.611.047.</p>
  <h2>5.11 View Inventory Physical Count</h2>
  <p>This release corrects an error when the Load on Hand button was clicked if serialized items were brought in.   </p>
  <p>The Inventory module must be enabled in order to access this function.</p>
  <h2>5.12 Return Authorization</h2>
  <p>This viewer now supports Intercompany Security; the Company&#39;s Security is correctly written to inventory history.</p>
  <h2>5.13 Inventory History</h2>
  <p>This release corrects an issue where just changing the Work Order Name could cause a reversal and forwarding of gl and inventory history entries using the original items date effective and accounting period (even if the accounting period was closed). </p>
  <h1>6 Accounts Receivable</h1>
  <h2>6.1 Accounts Receivable Registries</h2>
  <h3>6.1.1 AR Cash Receipts<span style="font-weight: bold;"> Journal - Set GL Entity for Intercompany Installations </span></h3>
  <p>If Intercompany is enabled, the balance sheet GL Entity is not &#39;sticky&#39;. Customer Note 1.14 details the new registries for setting the Default Balance Sheet Entity for this journal or globally.</p>
  <h3>6.1.1a AR Cash Receipts Journal - Force GL Bank Account from Payment Type</h3>
  <p>The following registries may be enabled to force the GL Bank Account to be set from the corresponding field in the Payment Type record. When the following registries are set:</p>
  <p style="margin-left: 48px;">1. Do not allow user to manually enter a GL Bank Account Id.</p>
  <p style="margin-left: 48px;">2. Do not allow transaction to save without a Payment Type Id.</p>
  <p style="margin-left: 48px;">3. Always default GL Bank from selected Payment Type.</p>

  <p style="margin-left: 8px;"><span style="font-weight: bold;">Setting Key:</span> DisabledFieldsParent   <span style="font-weight: bold;">Setting Value:</span> gl-bnk: glaccnt.id</p>
  <p style="margin-left: 8px;">Disable manual entry to the GL Bank Account field to prevent the user from attempting to do so and getting an error.</p>
  <p style="margin-left: 48px;"><span style="font-weight: bold;">Important:</span> If credit card processing is enabled the specified Payment Type must have the Bank GL Account field set. Preferably, all active Payment Type records should have the Bank GL Account field set.</p>
  <h3>6.1.2 AR Sales <span style="font-weight: bold;">Journal - Set GL Entity for Intercompany Installations </span></h3>
  <p>If Intercompany is enabled, the balance sheet GL Entity is not &#39;sticky&#39;. Customer Note 1.14 details the new registries for setting the Default Balance Sheet Entity for manual entries in this journal or globally.</p>
  <h3>6.1.2a AR Sales Journal Registry - Require Work Order for Service Compute Jobs</h3>
  <p>Jobs indicated as &quot;Service Compute&quot; get billed by the Work Order, yet we allow costs to be entered and posted to Jobs w/o reference to any specific work order, leaving these unbilled costs in limbo. This feature may be activated to warn or error if a Work Order is not specified for Jobs flagged as &#39;Service Compute&#39; when manual entries are recorded.</p>
  <p style="margin-left: 48px;"><span style="font-weight: bold;">Note:</span> This setting may also be made globally in the sys-ffv-global-settings registry. If so, the local setting by Journal will trump the global entry.</p>
  <p><span style="font-weight: bold;">Registry Id:</span> sys-viewer-varslslst</p>
  <p><span style="font-weight: bold;">Setting Key:</span> NeedWOInServiceComputeJobs  <span style="font-weight: bold;">Setting Value: </span>Error, Warning or Neither (default Neither)</p>
  <p>When the Setting Value is set to <span style="font-weight: bold;">Error</span>, the user will be alerted when leaving a line lacking a Work Order Id and will not be able to save the record. Note that implementing Error on an existing system impacts your ability to edit existing entries. It should be implemented with caution.</p>
  <p>When <span style="font-weight: bold;">Warning</span> is implemented, the user will be alerted when leaving a line lacking a Work Order Id but will be able to save the record.</p>
  <p>If <span style="font-weight: bold;">Neither</span> is implemented (or the registry option does not exist) the user will not be alerted if a Service Compute type Job lacks a Work Order reference.</p>
  <h3 style="mso-fareast-font-family: &#39;Times New Roman&#39;;">6.1.3 OpenEdge / Global Payments Credit Card Processing - Option to use DBXChange Payfields Portal</h3>
  <p>Previously, the UserID column in Open Edge did not populate in reports due to OpenEdge integration no longer supporting their &#39;User Defined&#39; fields through their new APIs.<br/>
    The following updates have been added to the following fields:</p>
  <p>User ID: Provides SAMPro or TechAnywhere User ID depending on if it is created via SAMPro or TechAnywhere<br/>
    Invoice Number: Customer Notes:  Provides invoice numbers for TechAnywhere, cash receipts for single and multiple invoice, and Create PM Billing Adjustments.</p>
  <p>Previously, when a client used USAePay to negative credit card charge (credit), the processor was posting it as a positive charge against the credit card account. This update corrects this defect and negative credit card charges will now be a credit.</p>
  <p>By default, SAMPro&#39;s interface with OpenEdge / Global Payments continues to be managed by OpenEdge&#39;s X-Web portal. However,  this functionality will ultimately be sun-setted. The following registries are required to use DBXchange instead to PayFields portal for OpenEdge transactions (TechAnywhere already uses this functionality).</p>
  <p>The following registry entries are required to run OpenEdge with the new Payfields portal; we recommend running this in your test system first. Note that company-specific registries may be made if needed. Data-Basics&#39; DBXchange will be used in conjunction with an updated version of SAMPro Secure Communication. Please contact Data-Basics Support for assistance with the installation. Note that company-specific registries may be made if needed.  </p>
  <p>The registry to control whether the old vs new portal is used is the sys-ffv-global-setting&#39;s defaultpaymentprocessor. To use the new Open Edge portal it must be OEDBX. To use the old portal they should either leave it blank or use OE (as it has always been in the past).</p>
  <p><span style="font-weight: bold;">Registry Id:</span> sys-ffv-global-settings</p>
  <p><span style="font-weight: bold;">Setting Key:</span> defaultpaymentprocessor  <span style="font-weight: bold;">Setting Value:</span> OEDBX  (OE or blank uses the old portal)</p>
  <p>If the value is blank or OE the old X-Web portal will be used.  If the new Payfields portal (hosted on DBXChange) the Setting Value should be OEDBX.</p>
  <p>The following registry entries are required to run OpenEdge with the new Payfields portal (hosted on DBXChange). Note that company-specific registries may be made if needed. They should be used if the global settings registry defaultpaymentprocessor is set to OEDBX.</p>
  <p><span style="font-weight: bold;">Id:</span> sys-payment-processor</p>
  <p><span style="font-weight: bold;">Id:</span> sys-payment-processor-company:CompanyId  </p>
  <p>For example, the OpenEdge payment processor registry for Company 01 is:  sys-payment-processor-company:01</p>
  <p>To set up for Company-Specific processing, the Company-specific registries could contain either  </p>
  <p style="margin-left: 48px;">All required options for sys-payment-processor  </p>
  <p style="margin-left: 48px;">Or only the options that distinguish the companies, with the remaining settings in the basic directories (sys-payment-processor</p>

  <p style="margin-left: 8px;">It is recommended that you create a new Payment Type record with the Id set to OpenEdge or CRDCRD and the GL Bank Account set to the appropriate bank or sweep account for OpenEdge Payments. This will be used for recurring payment processing for preventative maintenance.</p>
  <h5><span style="font-weight: bold;">Obsolete Settings:</span> these registries should be <span style="font-weight: bold;">disabled or</span> for the New Portal (OEDBX):</h5>

  <h5>User Interface Changes:</h5>
  <p style="margin-left: 8px;">End users will notice a different user interface when specifying and alias or processing a payment.  Instead of the Open Edge X-Web portal appearing, the Payfield portal hosted on DBXChange will appear, as shown below. The user will simply enter the credit card number, expiration date, CVV code and then click the Submit button.  Note that the Country field (defaulted from the ZIP or Postal Code) is required for a successful submission.</p>
  <p><img alt="" border="0" src="assets/images/OENewPortal.png" style="border: none;"/></p>
  <p>In 9.1.611.059 and up, this release allows a smoother procedure in OpenEdge Processing when the User Id contains a space.</p>
  <h3>6.1.4 Registry Id to Enable Intercompany support for OpenEdge / Global Payments Processing</h3>
  <p>This release supports Company-specific functionality for OpenEdge / Global Payments processing. A new  Interco v.cus file must be installed (which includes the Company Id on Start Create PM Billing) and Company-specific registry settings must be created to support this functionality. If all Companies will be using the same settings only the base registry is needed.</p>
  <p>These Company-specific registries are identified by a special suffix on the Registry Id to define that the Company Id is being referenced.  The general form of the suffix is:</p>
  <p><span style="font-weight: bold;">Id:</span> sys-payment-processor-company:<span style="font-style: italic;">CompanyId</span>  </p>
  <p style="margin-left: 48px;">For example, the Open Edge payment processor registry for Company 01 is:  sys-payment-processor-company:01</p>
  <p style="margin-left: 48px;">To set up for Company-Specific processing, the Company-specific registries could contain either</p>
  <p style="margin-left: 48px;">All required options for sys-payment-processor</p>
  <p style="margin-left: 48px;">Or</p>
  <p style="margin-left: 48px;">Only the options that distinguish the companies, with the remaining settings in the basic directories (sys-payment-processor).  </p>
  <h3>6.1.5 AR Terms Processing To Enable Decimal Places in The Discount Percent</h3>
  <p>The AR Terms Discount % field is an integer field that did not support fractional percentage amounts (e.g., 1.5%) by default. This release supports a registry setting to implement an implied Decimal Place in the AR Terms Discount % Field which will allow the user to specify one (e.g, 10.5%) or two (e.g., 7.25%) decimal places.</p>
  <p><span style="font-weight: bold;">Registry Id:</span> sys-ffv-global-settings</p>
  <p><span style="font-weight: bold;">Setting Key:</span> ARTermsDecimals   Setting Value: 1 or 2  (default is 0 - registry absent)</p>
  <p style="margin-left: 40px;"><span style="font-weight: bold;">IMPORTANT:</span> Reset the AR Terms Discount Percent After Entering the Registry and Logging In Again<br/>
    <span style="font-weight: bold;">The user MUST review all AR Terms records and reset the Discount percent as needed after entering the Registry and logging in again.</span> If the registry was set to 1, for example, an AR Discount previously set to 7.00 would now be changed to 0.70% and must be manually adjusted as needed.
  </p>
  <p style="font-weight: bold; margin-left: 48px;">AR Terms Viewer - Changed Field: Discount Percent<br/>
    <span style="font-weight: normal;">The AR Terms viewer now displays the Discount Percent as 000.00 but validation will prevent setting the decimal places unless the above registry is set. Validation also controls the hundreds / tens settings (XX0.00) in AR Terms when the registry is set.</span>
  </p>
  <h2>6.2 Accounts Receivable Reports</h2>
  <h3>6.2.1 Report AR Aging</h3>
  <p>The DARAGE report (drill down aging) currently uses the Branch specified in the Client Site (of the COP order) for filtering COP orders. The revised report date 2017-09-19 uses the branch specified in the COP order itself and if blank steps defers to the Branch specified in the Site.</p>
  <p>The revised report dated 2017-09-18 now includes logic to get the customer&#39;s PO# from the Job if PO is blank in Invoice Master or on the Work Order. This corrects a problem where the PO# was not always shown for RININV3 Invoices.</p>
  <p>The revised Report AR Aging (DARAGE.rpt) dated 2016-04-05 now gets the PO from the Work Order if the PO is blank in the invoice. It also supports the following enhancements:</p>
  <p><span style="font-weight: bold;">New Option:</span> Show Collection Notes</p>
  <p><span style="font-weight: bold;">New Option: Age By - Invoice Date - Date Due</span><br/>
    Previously, this report always aged by the Invoice Date.  The user may now select the option to age by the Date Due instead.</p>
  <p><span style="font-weight: bold;">New Range: GL Entity Id</span><br/>
    This range allows the user to filter within AR Control Accounts</p>
  <h3>6.2.2 Report Customer Statement  (RCUSTSTMNTv80b048.rpt)</h3>
  <p><span style="font-weight: bold;">New Field: Print Statements With Balance Over</span><br/>
    The revised report dated 2017-11-15 replaces the Print Zero Balance Statements option with a Print Statements With Balance Over option. By default, this field is blank (zero) so that only positive balance statements will be generated. If a user wants to include zero balance statements they would enter $.01- in the Print Statements with Balance Order field. If a user wants to include credit balance statements they would enter $99999.99- (or some negative value) in the new input field.</p>
  <p>The revised report dated 2017-10-06 prints the consolidated invoice description for consolidated invoices.</p>
  <p>Report revised 2016-06-16 adds an option to Omit Invoice Description.</p>
  <p>This also supports an option to include the PDF&#39;d invoices referenced on the statement as part the PDF version of the statement report. Both job/service based invoices (document category INVOICE) and COP Invoices (document category COPINVOICE) will be included.</p>
  <p>If invoices were not originally saved as PDF&#39;s, the Start Document Archive Maintenance function may be used to convert these document types to PDF.</p>
  <p style="margin-left: 48px;"><span style="font-weight: bold;">Important:  Only the PDF&#39;d Statement Includes the Attachments</span><br/>
    The .dbr version of the Customer Statement will not display the attached invoices; it does display a list of attached files. Only the PDF&#39;d version of this report includes the &#39;package&#39; of invoice attachments.</p>
  <p style="margin-left: 8px; font-weight: bold;">Required File:</p>
  <p style="margin-left: 8px;">A whitesquare.bmp file (available from support) should be added to the directory where your bitmap graphics are stored.</p>
  <p style="margin-left: 8px; font-weight: bold;">Required Registry:</p>
  <p style="margin-left: 8px;"><span style="font-weight: bold;">Id:</span> sys-report-rcuststmnt  </p>
  <p style="margin-left: 8px;"><span style="font-weight: bold;">Setting Key:</span> IncludeInvoiceDocuments   <span style="font-weight: bold;">Setting Value:</span> Y    (default N)</p>
  <p style="margin-left: 8px;">This option is required to implement the new &#39; invoice package&#39; functionality.</p>
  <p style="margin-left: 8px;"><span style="font-weight: bold;">Setting Key:</span> sectionbackerbitmap   <span style="font-weight: bold;">Setting Value:</span> <span style="font-style: italic;">Pathname</span>\whitesquare.bmp</p>
  <p style="margin-left: 8px;">This registry is recommended to prevent the invoice bitmap from &#39;stepping on&#39; the attached documents. The bitmap may be obtained from support. Note that ONLY the bmp version of this file should be installed.</p>
  <p style="margin-left: 8px; font-weight: bold;">Additional Registries:</p>
  <p style="margin-left: 8px;">These reports support auto emailing.  The appropriate registry entries should be made to implement this functionality if invoice documents are included:</p>
  <p style="margin-left: 8px;">
    <font style="font-weight: bold;">Setting Key:</font> emailbysection <font style="font-weight: bold;"> Setting Value:</font> true

  </p>
  <h5>6.2.2b Client Status</h5>
  <p>The revised report (RCUSTSTMNTb80v048.rpt) dated 2016-08-26 includes the following new features:</p>
  <p><span style="font-weight: bold;">New Range: Client Status</span><br/>
    This field defaults to Active so to limit this reports to Client with an Active status. It is recommended that this range remains set to Active if the Print Zero Balance Statements? field is flagged. Setting the Range to Active,Credit Hold will include both Active Customers and those on Credit Hold on the report.</p>
  <p>There is a registry associated with this report that controls the text that appears when a zero balance statement shows on the report. By default, &#39;Zero Dollar Statement&#39; will appear. The following registry overrides this default.</p>
  <p><span style="font-weight: bold;">Id:</span> sys-report-RCUSTSTMNT</p>
  <p><span style="font-weight: bold;">Setting Key:</span> ZeroBalanceText</p>
  <p><span style="font-weight: bold;">Setting Value:</span> <span style="font-style: italic;">Text to appear on report</span>    (100 Character Maximum)</p>
  <p>Also adds an option to Omit Invoice Description</p>
  <h5>6.2.2c Revised Report Customer Statements (RCUSTSTMNTv80b048.rpt dated 2020-10-02 or later)</h5>
  <p><span style="font-weight: bold;">New Detail Option:</span> By Site By Job</p>
  <p style="font-weight: bold;">New Filter: Site Id</p>

  <p style="margin-left: 48px;"><span style="font-weight: bold;">Important Note - Scheduled Reports:</span> The change to the Invoice Description setting from Boolean to Button has potential to interfere if the prior definition is scheduled as a recurring report. In this case, the scheduled event for the report simply requires &quot;updating&quot; under Scheduling options.</p>
  <h3>6.2.3 Report Customer Statements 2 (RCUSTSTMNT2.rpt)</h3>
  <p>The revised report dated 2016-08-15 includes the following new features:</p>
  <p><span style="font-weight: bold;">New Field: Print Zero Balance Statements?</span><br/>
    Flagging this field enables the user to print a zero balance statement for the selected client or clients on this report.  <b><span style="font-weight: normal;">Clients with a total outstanding dollar balance in AR History equal to zero will be included on the report, subject to the setting of the other ranges.</span></b></p>
  <p><span style="font-weight: bold;">New Range: Client Status</span><br/>
    This field defaults to Active so to limit this reports to Client with an Active status. It is recommended that this range remains set to Active if the Print Zero Balance Statements? field is flagged. Setting the Range to Active,Credit Hold will include both Active Customers and those on Credit Hold on the report.</p>
  <p>There is a registry associated with this report that controls the text that appears when a zero balance statement shows on the report. By default, &#39;Zero Dollar Statement&#39; will appear. The following registry overrides this default.</p>

  <h3>6.2.6 <span style="font-weight: bold;">Report AR Cash Receipts Journal Receipt</span></h3>
  <p style="margin-left: 8px;">This report supports the new Print button in the AR Cash Receipts Journal. This button allows the user to print and email a receipt to the customer for the credit card payment processed from this viewer.  The following report must be installed to support this functionality:</p>
  <p>New Report:  Report AR Cash Receipts Journal Receipt (RARRCPTSTCKT.rpt)  </p>

  <p>The Revised Report AR Cash Receipts Journal Receipt (RARRCPTSTCKT.rpt) dated 2021-04-19 includes the following enhancements:</p>
  <p style="margin-left: 48px;">Support for Credit Memos<br/>
    Refinement when Receipt date precedes Invoice date<br/>
    Supports multiple applications to the same invoice on same day and additional refinements.</p>
  <h3>6.2.7 Report Lien Waiver Fillable (AR)</h3>
  <p>SAMPro&#39;s new Fillable Form functionality allows an AR Lien Waiver to generated as a fillable PDF.  This uses the boilerplate information included in a standard AR Lien Waiver to be combined with the information from SAMPro to quickly and easily generate the document. This Lien Waiver may then be emailed to the customer when payment is received. The Conditional option of the report indicates the current payment on the Job, and allows disputed amounts to be identified.  The Final option provides the formal release of the lien in and would be provided when the work is complete and all payments have been received.</p>
  <p style="margin-left: 48px;"><span style="font-weight: bold;">Important:</span> Note that this feature requires use of the XmlToPdf[2019-01-16 Java 8-11].jar file (or higher). </p>
  <p>The following tasks are support the above functionality:</p>
  <p>1. The Report Lien Waiver Fillable (AR) must be installed.</p>

  <h3>6.2.8 New Report Customer Statements 3</h3>
  <p>The new Report Customer Statements 3 (RCUSTSTMNT3.rpt) created 2021-03-24 is based on the existing Customer Statement report but includes the customer&#39;s PO number (based on WO or Job or Client Order accordingly) on the detail lines as the standard. The following fields are displayed on the detail lines:</p>
  <p>Invoice Id - PO - Invoice Date - Amount Owed - Age - Due Date - Amount Past Due - Days Past - Description</p>
  <p><span style="font-weight: normal;">Like the original Report Customer Statements report, Report Customer Statements 3 supports the &#39;packaging&#39; of PDF&#39;d invoices and TechAnywhere receipts (specified as runtime options/via registry) as well as auto-emailing (enabled via registry).  This report uses the Client Id as the sectionkey and the Client Collections Email Address for auto-emailing.</span></p>
  <h2>6.3 AR Cash Receipts Journal</h2>
  <p>Previously when processing a negative payment and using a payment alias, a text window would appear indicating that &quot;an error occurred&quot; even though the response was Approved. This update corrects this defect. </p>
  <p>Previously, when processing a credit card payment and a user closed out of the AR Cash Receipts screen or exited SAMPro before the process was complete, returning and completing the process would result in two transactions for the client and one transaction in SAMPro. This update prevents the viewer from closing while the payment is processing and removes the Cancel button from the progress bar.</p>
  <p>This update gives users permission to make field changes and delete child lines for saved records with processed payments. With the enabled registry, this allows the user to zero out the A/R child rows for &quot;incorrect&quot; invoices and insert the new rows with the &quot;correct&quot; invoices, so long as the total against the processed payment matches. <br/>
    <strong>Note: If the wrong amount was processed, the users must refund the CC transaction and reprocess it.</strong>
  </p>
  <p><strong>Id: </strong>sys-viewer-varrcptslst</p>
  <p><strong>Setting Key:</strong> AllowChangeToProcessedReceipt    <strong>Setting Value:</strong> true</p>
  <p>This release corrects a problem where invoices with non-intercompany security did not load when Client Id was entered and the user tabbed out of the field. This release also refines the &quot;autofill&quot; AR Cash Receipt logic regarding Other Tab entries so that appropriate enters will be available for the Bank Deposit Journal.</p>
  <p>This release tightens Job Cost Category / Job validation.</p>
  <p>A warning is now displayed when the user first accesses a journal entry which has been replaced by one with a higher &#39;tack&#39; number. This warning is designed to prevent the user from wasting time by attempting to make changes to a journal entry record which cannot be saved because it has already been replaced. See Customer Note 1.1.2 for a registry to disable this warning globally or by individual viewer.</p>
  <p>The &#39;Receipts Entered&#39; field is correctly updated when lines on the Other Tab are added or deleted.</p>
  <h3>6.3.1 AR Lines</h3>
  <p><span style="font-weight: bold;">Credit Card Processing:</span> Edits and deletions to AR lines for Credit Card paid entries are not allowed for Full users. Only Special (support) users are allowed to edit or delete. </p>
  <p><span style="font-weight: bold;">Changed Field: Cost Category</span><br/>
    This field now supports enhanced filtering provided by the Cost Code&#39;s Job Cost Category Usage Filter. Cost Categories are validated (relative to Cost Codes) during data entry upon leaving the Cost Category Id field (for example, when entering an Unapplied Deposit).  The full relationship is validated again when saving the record.</p>
  <h3>6.3.2 OpenEdge Credit Refunds</h3>
  <p>Edits and deletions to AR lines for Credit Card paid entries are not allowed for Full users. Only Special (support) users are allowed to edit or delete. However, Credit refunds may now be processed via Open Edge in the Cash Receipts Journal. To do so:</p>
  <p>1. Select a Credit Memo in the AR Cash Receipts Journal, and enter the Total Receipt as a negative number.</p>
  <p>2. Verify that the customer has their credit card ready, and then click the Process Payment button.</p>
  <p>3. Click through the usual messages; when the x-web portal opens, enter the customer&#39;s credit card number (without spaces or dashes) and expiration date and click Submit.</p>
  <p>4. If the card is approved, the web portal will display &quot;Approval&quot; in red and the customer&#39;s card will be credited with the refund.  If it is not approved, check the number and expiration date and try submitting it again.</p>
  <p>Previously, when Open Edge used USAePay to negative credit card charge (credit) was sent to the processor, the processor was posting it as a positive charge against the credit card account. The 9.1.611.062 update corrects this defect and negative credit card charges will now be a credit.</p>
  <h3>6.3.2a Allow Client Site Aliases to be Used for AR Cash Receipts</h3>
  <p class="MsoNormal">When an Invoice or Invoices have been selected for payment, the following will now happen when the Process Payments button is clicked:</p>
  <p class="MsoNormal" style="margin-left: .5in;">Determine the Client Site associated with each Invoice that has been selected for payment in the transaction being recorded.</p>
  <p class="MsoNormal" style="margin-left: .5in;">If an eligible alias token is NOT found, SAMPro will simply display a message reminding you that you will only have 60 seconds to enter the information; click Yes to continue.  </p>
  <p class="MsoNormal" style="margin-left: .5in;">If one or more Aliases are found, the system will display a list of the eligible Payment Alias/Token values found in the above list of Sites.  To be eligible, a Site&#39;s Alias/Token must have an expiration date greater than or equal to the current system date. </p>
  <p class="MsoNormal" style="margin-left: 88px;">If <b>No Selection</b> is highlighted and the Select button clicked SAMPro will display a message reminding you that you will only have 60 seconds to enter the information; click Yes to continue.  Another message informs you that the journal entry will be added before Payment Processing; click Yes again.  </p>
  <p class="MsoNormal" style="margin-left: 88px;">If an <b>existing Alias</b> is highlighted and the Select button clicked, the system will send the information to Open Edge; if approved, the Credit Card fields will be completed and the Cash Receipt saved.</p>
  <p class="MsoNormal" style="margin-left: 88px;">If the <b>Cancel</b> or red X button is clicked, the list will be closed SAMPro will display a message reminding you that you will only have 60 seconds to enter the information; click Yes to continue or Cancel to opt out of the payment processing.</p>
  <h3>6.3.2b Print Credit Card Receipt</h3>
  <p class="MsoNormal" style="font-weight: bold; margin-left: 8px;"><img alt="" border="0" src="assets/images/image/SKIN1_Printer.gif" style="border: none;"/> <span style="font-weight: normal;">If the Report AR Cash Receipts Journal Receipt is installed, clicking this button launches the receipt report for the credit card payment processed in this entry. When the Email button is clicked in the Report display, the Email To will automatically be set to the Client Contact Email address. The report will be attached and the Email&#39;s Subject will use the following format: Cash Receipt Id 10230 was paid using Payment Processing with Id 000000007768.</span></p>
  <h3>6.3.3 Unapplied Deposits</h3>
  <p>When an Unapplied Deposit is entered in the AR Cash Receipts journal, the Invoice Master fields are now set as follows:</p>
  <p style="margin-left: 48px;">Currency Id: Defaults from the Client; this field was previously blank.</p>
  <p style="margin-left: 48px;">Effective Date: Defaults from the Cash Receipt&#39;s Effective Date; this field was previously blank.</p>
  <p style="margin-left: 48px;">Entry Type: Now set to Unapplied; it was previously set to Unknown</p>
  <p style="margin-left: 48px;">Status: This is now set to Posted; it was previously set to New,</p>
  <p style="margin-left: 8px;">When a database conversion is triggered, previously entered Unapplied Deposits will have their Effective Date, Entry Type and Status reset to the new values.</p>
  <p style="margin-left: 8px;">Note that when entering an Unapplied Deposit, the user should fill out the Description indicating the Invoice that the overpayment was made to if this is known; this will be displayed in AR Cash Receipts Journal&#39;s the new Invoice Description column.</p>
  <h3>6.3.4 Open Invoice List</h3>
  <p><span style="font-weight: bold;">New Field - PO#</span><br/>
    This new column appears to the right of the Work Order Id column. It displays the customer&#39;s Purchase Order specified on the Work Order&#39;s PO# field.</p>
  <p><span style="font-weight: bold;">New Field - Invoice Description:</span><br/>
    The Invoice Description for each Invoice, CM or Unapplied Payment is displayed in this new column on the right-hand side of the list.</p>
  <h5>6.3.4a Filter on the Open Invoice List</h5>
  <p>This release employs the new list filtering functionality (see Customer Note 1.9.3) in the AR Cash Receipts Journal so that the user can easily filter on the invoices to be paid. To use this functionality in the Cash Receipts Journal:</p>
  <p style="margin-left: 48px;">Enter the Client Id and tab out of the field.</p>
  <p style="margin-left: 48px;">Right-click on the column title in the Open Invoices list that you wish to filter on.</p>
  <p style="margin-left: 48px;">When the Column Filter popup appears, enter an appropriate filter for the selected column and click OK to apply the filter.</p>
  <p style="margin-left: 48px;">More that one filter may be applied if needed. The Running Balance on the Open Invoice List is updated after column filters are applied to the list.</p>
  <p style="margin-left: 48px;">When Open Invoice list has been filtered to match the customer&#39;s payment, click the Auto-Fill Transactions button. Only the invoices in the filtered list will be selected.</p>
  <h3>6.3.5 Apply Overpayments to Original Invoice</h3>
  <p>In previous releases, if a customer paid the same invoice twice, there was no good way to apply the payment to the original invoice.  In this release, a registry entry may be implemented to enable the clone function in the AR Cash Receipts Journal to do so.</p>
  <h5>Registry to Implement</h5>
  <p><span style="font-weight: bold;">Id:</span> sys-viewer-varrcptslst</p>
  <p><span style="font-weight: bold;">Setting Key:</span> isOkToCloneRecord  <span style="font-weight: bold;">Setting Value:</span> true  (default is false)</p>
  <p>Note that Cloning is NOT allowed if NewReversing is enabled in the AR Cash Receipts Journal.</p>
  <h5>Procedure to &#39;Clone&#39; the Cash Receipt</h5>
  <p>1. Access the original AR Cash Receipt you wish to copy.</p>
  <p>2. On the menu at the top of the viewer, select Record &gt; Clone Record.</p>
  <p>3. The system will copy the original receipt, clearing the Check Number and Credit Card fields.</p>
  <p>4. Enter the new Check Number,  Accounting Period, Effective Date and other fields as needed and Add the new record. AR History will show the additional payment to the specified invoice.</p>
  <h3>6.3.6 Recent Change to Credit Card Processing</h3>
  <p>Previously, when a client in New Call cleared or blanked out the payment alias, it cleared the information from the screen. When the New Call was added, it cleared out the Client Site Payment Alias field in the client site record but left the data in the Client Site Masked Credit Card Number, Client Site Credit Card Expiration Date, Client Site Masked Credit Card Transaction Id fields. The 9.1.611.062 update corrects this defect and adds a warning popup message that says: &quot;Warning: You are about to delete Credit Card payment information from the record.&quot; </p>
  <p><strong>Credit Card Charged When Negative Amount submitted:</strong></p>
  <p>Previously, when a customer was issued a credited amount using their credit card on file, it would result in an additional charge instead of a credit.  Now transactions with a negative amount are issued as credits (not charges) on the credit card.</p>
  <p><span style="font-weight: bold;">Changed Field: CC Trx Id:</span><br/>
    In previous releases, the reference number recorded for a credit card transaction in this field depended on where the payment transaction was recorded in SAMPro, and which credit card processing company was used. This could have been either the transaction Id or the authorization code, causing inconsistent data on records and reports. Because pre-authorized transactions do not have an authorization code at the time of transaction, all transactions will now reference the transaction Id regardless of source or processor.    </p>
  <p><span style="font-weight:bold;">Invalid client information in Open Edge payment browser</span></p>
  <p>In 9.1.611.059 and up, this update corrects an error that added extra symbols in the zipcode after clicking Process Payment in the AR Cash Receipts. Before, it would replace the zipcode’s dash (“-“) with characters“%2D” instead. Locally solve this issue by clearing the cache/browser history. <br/>
    To clear cache and browser history:<br/>
    1.    Go to internet settings<br/>
    2.    Click Privacy and Security<br/>
    3.    Click Clear browsing data<br/>
    4.    Check the checkboxes for browsing history and cache images and files.<br/>
    5.    Click Clear Data<br/>
    <span style="font-weight:bold;">Note: Clearing cache needs to be done <span style="text-decoration:underline;">after</span> installation.</span>
  </p>
  <h3>6.3.6a Open Edge - &quot;Approved + Error&quot; Response incorrectly being treated as failed</h3>
  <p>In Open Edge / Global Payments, you can process a card (payment or alias) and get an Approval + an error attached. In previous releases, SAMPro treated this scenario as a failed transaction, but in reality the transaction had been approved and showed on the OpenEdge Merchant site <span style="font-weight: bold; 
	 font-style: italic;">if</span> the Open Edge account was set up to approve transactions with these issues.</p>
  <p>In this version 9.1.611.056, SAMPro now treats the following as Approved:</p>
  <p style="margin-left: 48px;">Approved - AVS &amp; CSC Mismatch<br/>
    Approved - AVS Mismatch<br/>
    Approved - CSC Mismatch</p>
  <p>Note that an AVS Mismatch occurs if the billing address does not match the address on file with the card-issuing bank or credit card company.  A CSC Mismatch occurs if the Card Security Code does not match.  </p>
  <h3>6.3.7 AR Cash Receipts Other Tab</h3>
  <p><span style="font-weight: normal;">This release provides validation to prevent the use of AR Control GL Accounts on the Other tab. The following message will be displayed if the user enters an AR Control Account: &#39;Cannot use GL Account with Account Type &#39;&#39;AR Control&#39;&#39; on Other tab&#39;.  This change was made to prevent issues with AR and GL not matching if, for example, an entry was made on the Other tab to record over-receipt against an invoice that could be left &#39;on account&#39;.</span><span style="font-weight: bold;"> </span></p>
  <h2>6.4 AR Sales Journal</h2>
  <p style="margin-left: 8px;">In 9.1.611.060 and up, this  update adds an Invoice Billed Amount to the AR Sales Journal list called “InvoiceAmt.” This new column is between the Client Name and Trans Id when users select the sort by ARSalesByInvoiceId. The invoice amount is read from the transaction.</p>
  <p style="margin-left: 8px;">This update allows authorized users to edit or delete AR lines for Credit Card paid cash receipts. Previously edit and delete options were not allowed to full users. Now authorized users can make edits to the sales journal after it has been paid except for invoice amounts, invoice Id, invoice date, gl account, and accounting period.</p>
  <p style="margin-left: 8px;"><strong>Id:</strong> sys-viewer-varslslst<br/>
    <strong>Setting Key: </strong>AllowLimitedChangeToReceiptedInvoice     <strong>Setting Key:</strong> true
  </p>
  <p style="margin-left: 8px;">This release tightens Job Cost Category / Job validation.</p>
  <p>A warning is now displayed when the user first accesses a journal entry which has been replaced by one with a higher &#39;tack&#39; number. This warning is designed to prevent the user from wasting time by attempting to make changes to a journal entry record which cannot be saved because it has already been replaced. See Customer Note 1.1.2 for a registry to disable this warning globally or by individual viewer.</p>
  <h5>6.4.1 Credit Memos</h5>
  <p>This release displays the following warning when the user elects to create a credit memo from an existing Sales Journal transaction that includes sales tax. It is important that users manually update lines if a partial credit will be taken.</p>
  <p style="margin-left: 48px;">WARNING:  This transaction includes Sales Tax.</p>
  <p style="margin-left: 48px;">It is your responsibility to view and manually adjust each Tax line if needed.  Use the magnified view of each Tax line to make all necessary adjustments to the Tax Base, Invoice Amount, etc.</p>
  <h3>6.4.1 Prices Tab</h3>
  <p style="margin-left: 8px;"><span style="font-weight: bold;">Changed Field: Cost Category</span><br/>
    This field now supports enhanced filtering provided by the Cost Code&#39;s Job Cost Category Usage Filter. Cost Categories are validated (relative to Cost Codes) when saving the record or tabbing out of the Cost Code field.</p>
  <h2>6.5 Avalara Sales Tax Import</h2>
  <p style="margin-left: 48px;"><span style="font-weight: bold; color: #ff3535;">WARNING: Avalara Data Import</span><span style="font-weight: bold;"></span><br/>
    Recent changes to formatting configurations within the Avalara import files for certain states may require manual updates to Sales Tax Authorities/Groups following the update; for this Data-Basics does <span style="font-weight: bold;">NOT</span> recommend this functionality. These manual updates must be handled by your firm&#39;s personnel.  We strongly suggest switching to the Avalara Web Service discussed in Customer Note 6.6.</p>
  <p>The following enhancements have been made to manage some of the tax anomalies within the Avalara data, and to alert the user to any potential manual changes that may be required.</p>
  <p>1. When the Go button is pressed to import an Avalara tax file, validation has been added to show any anomalies in the data about to be imported. When anomalies are found 2 workspaces and a message box will appear. These workspace reports are provided for the users to review the integrity of the data.</p>
  <p style="margin-left: 48px;">The first workspace report gives the Authority Id, Tax Type, Tax Rate and Count.  Count is the number of records found in the Avalara import file for that Authority’s Tax Rate.</p>
  <p style="margin-left: 48px;">The second workspace report lists Authority Id, Authority Name, Tax Rate, Tax Type and Signature.  The signature shows the zip code and Authority Id’s found with a 0% tax rate. </p>
  <p>2. We suggest printing these workspaces before continuing; this will provide you with the information needed if manual adjustments must be made.</p>
  <p>3. When the data is imported, if the system finds a state, county or local tax that changes to a zero rate, the system will attempt to create a new tax authorities with a &#39;z&#39; added to the Id. This will result in a new Sales Tax Group being generated.  These new Sales Tax Groups must be added to Jobs as needed.</p>
  <p>Previously, Avalara Quote processing was slow functioning, and an error message would appear when a user in Avalara had an exempt certificate. This happened because the Sales Tax Group in SAMPro should not be changed to 0.00 but is updated to 0.00 when there is an Exemption Certificate related to an Avalara transaction. This update improves the Quote processing performance and Avalara transactions in general.</p>
  <p>Previously, all COP invoices added $.01 to the base price in Avalara and then returned the overstated base price back to the Tax History in SAMPro. This update corrects this defect.</p>
  <h2>6.6 Avalara Web Service</h2>
  <p>This release corrects a problem encountered when Server name includes the backslash character.  </p>
  <h3><span style="font-weight: bold;">6.6.1 Overview</span></h3>
  <p>This release supports an alternative method of computing sales tax on AR Invoices using the Avalara Web Service Integration instead of SAMPro&#39;s internal computations. This functionality is currently supported for Sales Tax and Tax Exempt invoices, but not for Use tax computation. An advantage of using Avalara is that they will provide the tax reporting to supported districts.</p>
  <p>After obtaining your license and credentials from Avalara, the following registry must be set to enable the Avalara Web Integration. It is required that testing in a &#39;sandbox&#39; test system be conducted before running live.</p>
  <p>Avalara has a field labeled Reference Code that is the functional equivalent of a SAMPro user-defined field.  That field is now used to hold the WO Id, Job Id, SAMPro Version No and Function. </p>
  <h3><span style="font-weight: bold;">6.6.2 Registries to Turn on Avalara Web Integration</span></h3>

  <p style="font-style: italic;">The above registry settings specify the appropriate default Avalara Tax Code to use for Fixed Fee Billing Items. They may be trumped by the Avalara Tax Code in the Job Billing Item.</p>
  <h5>6.6.3b Overriding Fixed Fee Tax Codes by Job Billing Item:</h5>
  <p style="font-style: normal;">This enhancement supports the optional specification of Job Billing Item-specific Avalara Tax Codes If the following registry is enabled it is used to switch between the two methods of determining the appropriate Avalara Tax Code:</p>
  <p style="margin-left: 48px;">a) Fixed Fee Avalara Tax Codes referenced in the sys-avalara registry;</p>
  <p style="margin-left: 48px;">b) Avalara Tax Codes in the Job Billing Item User field defined in the registry below.</p>
  <p style="margin-left: 8px;">This information will be referenced in the Record Billing Adjustments function when the user pushes the Compute Taxes button.</p>
  <p style="margin-left: 8px;"><span style="font-weight: bold;">Id:</span> sys-avalara</p>
  <p style="margin-left: 8px;"><span style="font-weight: bold;">Setting Key:</span> FixedFeeTaxCodeUserField   <span style="font-weight: bold;">Setting Value:</span> <span style="font-style: italic;">integer from 1 to 5</span></p>
  <p style="margin-left: 8px;">The Setting Value specifies which Job Billing Item User field should contain the Avalara Tax Code for Fixed Fee Job Billing Items. If entered, it trumps all other Fixed Fee-based Tax Codes from the Avalara registry.</p>
  <p style="margin-left: 48px;"><span style="font-weight: bold;">Tip: Job Billing Item User Field Referenced by FixedFeeTaxCodeUserField</span>  <br/>
    It is strongly recommended that the Custom Fields functionality is used to relabel the applicable Job Billing Item User field as &quot;Avalara Tax Code: &quot;. The appropriate Custom Field Values should also be set to the appropriate 8 or 2 character code (as specified by Avalara).</p>
  <h5>6.6.3c Registry to Disable Use Tax Calculations</h5>
  <p>This release offers an option (highly recommended) to disable calls to the external tax service in situations where Use Tax is being calculated.  When disabled, Use Tax computations are done with SAMPro and no external call is made.</p>
  <p><span style="font-weight: bold;">Id: </span>sys-ffv-global-settings</p>
  <p><span style="font-weight: bold;">Setting Key:</span> UseExternalTaxServiceForUseTax   <span style="font-weight: bold;">Setting Value:</span> false  (default is true)</p>
  <h5>6.6.3d. Registry to Configure or Enable / Disable Avalara Web Service by Company</h5>
  <p>This release supports optional registry settings that enable company-specific settings within a multi-tenant database (Intercompany).</p>
  <p>Company-specific settings provide replacement values for any standard Avalara setting found in the sys-avalara registry.  It is NOT necessary to completely define all settings in the company-specific registry.  You only need to include those that are different from the standard (sys-avalara) settings.  This allows different Avalara Account and License numbers to be specified, or for the Avalara Web functionality to be disabled for one or more Companies within the SAMPro database.</p>
  <p>Registry Id is formatted as sys-avalara-company:<span style="font-style: italic;">CompanyId</span></p>
  <p style="text-decoration: underline; ">Example: Disable Tax Service for Company 01:</p>
  <p><span style="font-weight: bold;">Id:</span> sys-avalara-company:01</p>
  <p><span style="font-weight: bold;">Setting Key:</span> TaxServiceDisabled    <span style="font-weight: bold;">Setting Value:</span> true</p>
  <p style="text-decoration: underline; ">Example: Specify Different License and Account Number for Company 02</p>
  <p>Note that this registry assumes that the ProductionEnvironment, CompanyCode and OriginAddress options are set in the base sys-avalara registry.</p>
  <p><span style="font-weight: bold;">Id:</span> sys-avalara-company:02</p>
  <p><span style="font-weight: bold;">Setting Key:</span> Account   <span style="font-weight: bold;">Setting Value:</span> 123456789</p>
  <p><span style="font-weight: bold;">Setting Key:</span> License   <span style="font-weight: bold;">Setting Value:</span> ABC123456789</p>
  <h3>6.6.3e Registry to Implement Job Specific Avalara Exempt Codes</h3>
  <p>In previous releases, all exempt jobs used the sys-avalara registry setting for DefaultExemptEntityCode.  In this release, an option allows for job-specific Exempt Entity Codes using the following registry AND by setting the appropriate Job User Field.</p>
  <p><span style="font-weight: bold;">Registry Id:</span> sys-avalara</p>
  <p><span style="font-weight: bold;">Setting Key:</span> ExemptEntityCodeUserField  <span style="font-weight: bold;">Setting Value</span>: <span style="font-style: italic;">JobUserFieldNumber</span></p>
  <p style="margin-left: 48px;">Example: Use Job User field 10 to provide specify the GL Entity Id that overrides the GL Entity specified by the DefaultExemptEntityCode registry option:</p>
  <p style="margin-left: 48px;"><span style="font-weight: bold;">Setting Key:</span> ExemptEntityCodeUserField  <span style="font-weight: bold;">Setting Value</span>: 10</p>
  <p style="margin-left: 48px;"><span style="font-weight: bold;">Setting Key:</span> DefaultExemptEntityCode  <span style="font-weight: bold;">Setting Value:</span> G</p>
  <h3>6.6.3f Registry To Specify Avalara Origin Country</h3>
  <p style="margin-left: 8px;">In previous releases, the following error message would appear if a company using Avalara Web Services attempted to bill a site in a different country: &#39;Missing or Invalid state/province code&#39;.</p>
  <p style="margin-left: 8px;">This new registry option should be made by companies wishing to do business in other countries (i.e., Canada).</p>
  <p style="margin-left: 8px;"><span style="font-weight: bold;">Registry Id:</span> sys-avalara</p>
  <p style="margin-left: 8px;"><span style="font-weight: bold;">Setting Key:</span> OriginAddressCountry  <span style="font-weight: bold;">Setting Value:</span> <span style="font-style: italic;">AvalaraCountryCode</span></p>
  <p style="margin-left: 48px; text-decoration: underline; ">For example, US companies also doing business in Canada would make the following entry:</p>
  <p style="margin-left: 48px;"><span style="font-weight: bold;">Registry Id:</span> sys-avalara</p>
  <p style="margin-left: 48px;"><span style="font-weight: bold;">Setting Key:</span> OriginAddressCountry  <span style="font-weight: bold;">Setting Value:</span> US</p>
  <h3>6.6.3g Option to Not Submit $0 (Zero Dollar) Invoices</h3>
  <p>This update allows users to prevent unnecessary transactions for zero-dollar invoices. </p>
  <p><strong>Id:</strong> sys-avalara    </p>
  <p><strong>Setting Key: </strong>SkipZero$Invoices    Setting Value:  true<br/>
     </p>
  <h3>6.6.4 Other Record Configurations for the Avalara Web Service</h3>
  <p style="font-weight: bold;">User:</p>
  <p>A SAMPro Special User must be set up to manage the handshake between SAMPro and the Avalara Web Service Integration.  This User Id and Password must both be set to <span style="font-weight: bold;">taxservice</span>.</p>
  <p style="font-weight: bold;">Job Cost Category:</p>
  <p style="margin-left: 48px; font-weight: bold;">Job Cost Category Group: Avalara</p>
  <p style="margin-left: 48px;"><span style="font-weight: bold;">Avalara Tax Code:</span><br/>
    Service Invoice Job Cost Categories should have this field completed if the Avalara-defined default value should not be used.</p>
  <p style="margin-left: 88px; font-weight: bold;">Tip: Avalara Tax Code:<br/>
    <span style="font-weight: normal;">It is strongly recommended that the Custom Fields functionality is used to specify the valid codes (as specified by Avalara).</span>
  </p>
  <p style="margin-left: 48px; font-weight: bold;">Job Cost Category Group:<br/>
    <span style="font-weight: normal;">A Job Cost Category Group should be created with the Id of Avalara.</span>
  </p>
  <p style="margin-left: 8px; font-weight: bold;">Job:</p>
  <p style="margin-left: 48px;"><span style="font-weight: bold;">Client Site Id:</span><br/>
    A Job that is not Site-specific is NOT eligible for Avalara tax calculations.  This applies to both service and progress billing methodologies. The Tax Group must be specified in the Job when invoicing through Record Billing Adjustment.</p>
  <p style="font-weight: bold; margin-left: 48px;">Sales Tax Group:<br/>
    <span style="font-weight: normal;">The Sales Tax Group record includes a field labeled Imported From which should contain one of three valid values.</span>
  </p>
  <p class="MsoNormal" style="margin-left: 88px;">Imported From = <b><i>blank</i></b> … this indicates the record was manually created in SAMPro and it has no relationship to Avalara tax processing.</p>
  <p class="MsoNormal" style="margin-left: 88px;">Imported From = <b><i>Avalara</i></b> … this indicates the record was created by importing from CSV files provided by Avalara.  This is an older technology;  SAMPro no longer support any changes to that code. Users encountering issues should consider switching to the AvaTax product.</p>
  <p class="MsoNormal" style="margin-left: 88px;">Imported From = <b><i>AvalaraService</i></b> … this indicates the record was created automatically (by SAMPro) using information provided by Avalara’s AvaTax web service.</p>
  <p class="MsoNormal" style="margin-left: 48px;"><span style="font-weight: normal;">If this Group was created in SAMPro or via the Import Sales Tax (Avalara) SAMPro&#39;s internal sales tax processing will be used to generate sales or use tax on invoices for this job. If this field is blank, or it contains a Sales Tax Group generated by a call to the Avatax Web Service, the Sales Tax (or Exempt Amount) will computed via the Avalara Web Integration.</span><span style="font-weight: bold;"> The Tax Group must be specified in the Job when invoicing through Record Billing Adjustment.</span></p>
  <p style="margin-left: 48px;"><img alt="" border="0" src="assets/images/SetTaxGroup.bmp" style="border: none;"/>  If the Sales Tax Group is blank and the Avalara Web Integration is enabled, clicking this button will make a call to Avalara to set the correct Sales Tax Group for invoicing this Sales or Exempt Job. Note that the Sales Tax Group is required  for Progress billed Jobs since the Sales Tax Group must be completed in order to access Record Billing Adjustments.</p>
  <p style="margin-left: 8px; font-weight: bold;">Client Site:</p>
  <p style="margin-left: 48px;"><img alt="" border="0" src="assets/images/ValidateAddress.bmp" style="border: none;"/> If the Avalara Web Integration is enabled, clicking this button will make a call to Avalara to validate that Work Site Address is correctly configured so that the correct Sales Tax Authority Group can be determined when invoicing.</p>
  <p style="margin-left: 48px;">This update ensures SAMPro&#39;s invoice reversal process does not allow “locked” Avalara documents to get reversed. Avalara locks a document once it has become part of a tax return report.</p>
  <h3>6.6.5 Other Files</h3>
  <p style="margin-left: 48px; font-style: italic;">The following files compatible with the v.exe SAMPro image must reside in the same directory:</p>
  <p style="margin-left: 48px; font-style: italic;">vdevw.exe.manifest</p>
  <p style="margin-left: 48px; font-style: italic;">v.exe.manifest</p>
  <p style="margin-left: 48px; font-style: italic;">SamproNetFramework.dll</p>
  <p style="margin-left: 48px; font-style: italic;">Newtonsoft.Json.dll</p>
  <p style="margin-left: 48px; font-style: italic;">Data-Basics.Avalara.Net (Folder and contents)</p>
  <h3>6.6.6 Starter Functions</h3>
  <h5>6.6.6a Start Validate Avalara Configuration</h5>
  <p style="margin-left: 8px;">This function allows validation without having the UseExternalTaxService setting turned on.  This allows authentication of the configuration (sys-avalara) prior to enabling live integration.<span style="font-weight: bold;"> </span></p>
  <h5>6.6.6b Start Compute Service Invoice</h5>
  <p style="margin-left: 8px;">When using the Avalara Web Service, a new workspace may pop up before the check list is displayed.  It relays to the user any issues reported by Avalara.  WO/Jobs with errors will still show in the check list but can&#39;t be selected for billing.</p>
  <h3>6.6.7 Recent Avalara Web Changes as of 9.1.611.047</h3>
  <p style="margin-left: 8px;"><span style="font-weight: bold;">1</span>. A Job that is not Site-specific is NOT eligible for Avalara tax calculations.  This applies to both service and progress billing methodologies. The Tax Group must be specified in the Job when invoicing through Record Billing Adjustment.</p>
  <p style="margin-left: 8px;">2. Better Avalara-based error handling has been implemented in the service invoicing process.  A new workspace pops up before the check list is displayed.  It relays to the user any issues reported by Avalara.  WO/Jobs with errors will still show in the check list but can&#39;t be selected for billing.</p>
  <p style="margin-left: 8px;">3. Avalara has a field labeled Reference Code that is the functional equivalent of a SAMPro user-defined field.  That field is now used to hold the WO Id, Job Id, SAMPro Version No and Function. </p>
  <h3>6.6.7a Recent Avalara Web Service Changes as of 9.1.611.049</h3>
  <p>Tax Exemption Certificates may be managed within Avalara by using what Avalara calls the Customer Code.  In previous releases, SAMPro submitted the Job Id as the Customer Code.  In this release, the Client Id is now used as the Customer Code for Avalara when invoices are processed to support Avalara&#39;s Tax Exemption handling.</p>
  <p>Since it is helpful for SAMPro users to see Job Names when reviewing Invoice Documents at the Avalara website, the Job Name has also be included as part of the Avalara Reference Code in square brackets:</p>
  <p>WorkOrder Id.Job Id.[Job Name].(SAMProVersion.SendingFunction)</p>
  <h3>6.6.7.b Recent Avalara Web Service Changes as of 9.1.611.059</h3>
  <p>This update is designed to handle Avalara&#39;s returned errors in order to relay Avalara&#39;s error message back to the user. Users may bypass address validation by referring to Avalara documentation. In addition, this update contains a correction so the mentioned bypass correctly sends and receives data between SAMPro and Avalara.</p>
  <p>This update integrates the change quoting function to Avalara for Estimated Sales tax. </p>
  <p>This update constructs a .Net WebAPI that implements the interface currently provided by the COM functionality. This requires Smalltalk changes to invoke the WebAPI methods instead of the COM methods. This has the added byproduct of allowing other Data-Basics products to implement the same integrations.</p>
  <p>This update integrates the change quoting function to Avalara for Estimated Sales tax. </p>
  <h3>6.6.7.c Recent Avalara Web Service Changes as of  9.1.611.060</h3>
  <p>This update integrates SAMPro&#39;s quoting functionality to allow users to relay information to Avalara for Estimated Sales tax.</p>
  <p>This update is designed to handle Avalara&#39;s returned errors in order to relay Avalara&#39;s error message back to the user.<br/>
    Users may bypass address validation by referring to Avalara documentation.<br/>
    In addition, this update contains a correction so the mentioned bypass correctly sends and receives data between SAMPro and Avalara.</p>
  <h3>6.6.7.d Recent Avalara Web Service Changes as of  9.1.611.062</h3>
  <p>This update ensures the Invoice Master Viewer’s invoice reversal process does not allow “locked” Avalara documents to get reversed.  Invoice reversal process includes the WO Viewer Invoices tab, various AR and GL reports, the Avalara web portal, etc. Avalara invoice reversal process now does the following: <br/>
    When the status is COMMITTED, VOIDED, or LOCKED, the restrictions noted below apply unless the user is running a special session.  <br/>
    Special sessions include (a) running in development mode; (b) logging in with one of the Master Passwords; or (c) running as a user with an Account Type of Special.<br/>
    When the status is COMMITTED or LOCKED, these restrictions apply:<br/>
    1.    Record cannot be deleted.<br/>
    2.    Child lines cannot be deleted.<br/>
    3.    Child lines cannot be inserted.<br/>
    Field changes are denied except for parent Description, Due Date, child Description.<br/>
    When the status is VOIDED, all record changes and deletions are denied.</p>
  <h3>6.6.8 New Report: Report Avalara Invoice Status (RAVALARAINVSTTS)</h3>
  <p>This new report (dated 2019-11-16) analyzes a set of SAMPro A/R Invoices and shows the current status of the corresponding documents at Avalara by comparing the SAMPro Invoice Master records with Avalara Transaction DocCodes. This report requires SAMPro Version 9.1.611.051 or above. The Avalara Web Service MUST be enabled via the global registry in order for this report to run properly.</p>
  <p>Report Settings: Beginning Date, Ending Date, Show Discrepancies Only</p>
  <p>Report Ranges: Invoice Id, Client Id, Job Id, Work Order Id, Client Site Id, Client Site Shipping Address State.</p>
  <p>Report Columns: Invoice Id, Invoice Date, SAMPro Invoice Status, Client Id, Job Id, Work Order Id, Site Id, Avalara Document Status</p>
  <h2>6.7 Electronic Payments Credit Card Processing</h2>
  <h3>6.7.1 Electronic Payments Setup</h3>
  <p>SAMPro now supports Electronic Payments credit card processing as well as OpenEdge. Data-Basics works with USAePay as the middleman to Electronic Payment (the company that SAMPro users would sign up with).</p>
  <p><span id="BugEvents4">1. To enable this functionality in SAMPro, you must first set up an account with Electronic Payments. Once you have done an API Key and PIN number must be generated for when you set up your SAMPro registries.</span></p>
  <p>Instructions for generating an API PIN/Key:</p>
  <p style="margin-left: 48px;">Log into EP&#39;s customer merchant console (Vault Gateway).<br/>
    Under Settings, click API Keys (If API Keys option is missing, contact EPI support).<br/>
    Click Add API Key on upper right.<br/>
    Name = Databasics<br/>
    PIN = any random 4 digit key you feel like typing (remember this for registry)<br/>
    Click Save on lower right. After saving, it will auto-generate an API Key. Use this for the registry.</p>
  <p><span>2.  SamproSecureCommunication.war must be installed in Glassfish to enable this functionality. If your firm does not already have a Glassfish server installed (for DBAnalytics or TechAnywhere) contact your support representative to set this up.</span></p>
  <p><span>3. I</span>t is recommended that you create a new Payment Type record with the Id set to EPCreditCard and the GL Bank Account set to the appropriate bank or sweep account for Electronic Payments. This will be used for recurring payment processing.</p>
  <p><span>4. Complete the registry entries listed below.</span></p>
  <p><span>5. We recommend testing this functionality in your sandbox first. When you go life with this functionality, test with a company credit card before using for customers.</span></p>
  <h3>6.7.2  Registries to Enable Electronic Payments Credit Card Processing</h3>
  <h5>Registry to Specify Electronic Payments as the Payment Processor</h5>
  <p><span style="font-weight: bold;">Registry ID:</span> sys-ffv-global-settings</p>
  <p><span style="font-weight: bold;">Setting Key:</span> DefaultPaymentProcessor  Setting Value: EP</p>
  <p>This registry is required to specify Electronic Payments as the payment processor, If this registry is absent, Open Edge (OE) is assumed to be the default processor.</p>
  <h5>Registry to Configure Electronic Payments Processing</h5>
  <p><span style="font-weight: bold;">Registry Id:</span> sys-payment-processor-ep</p>
  <h5>Registry Id to Enable Intercompany support Electronic Payments Credit Card Processing</h5>
  <p>This release supports Company-specific functionality for Electronic Payments processing. A new  Interco v.cus file must be installed (to add the Company Id to Create PM Billings) and Company-specific registry settings must be created to support this functionality. If all Companies will be using the same settings only the base registry is needed.</p>
  <p>These Company-specific registries are identified by a special suffix on the Registry Id to define that the Company Id is being referenced.  The general form of the suffix is:</p>
  <p><span style="font-weight: bold;">Id:</span> sys-payment-processor-EP-company:<span style="font-style: italic;">CompanyId</span>  </p>
  <p style="margin-left: 48px;">For example, the EP payment processor registry for Company 01 is:  sys-payment-processor-EP-company:01</p>
  <p style="margin-left: 48px;">To set up for Company-Specific processing, the Company-specific registries could contain either</p>
  <p style="margin-left: 48px;">All required options for sys-payment-processor-EP</p>
  <p style="margin-left: 48px;">Or</p>
  <p style="margin-left: 48px;">Only the options that distinguish the companies, with the remaining settings in the basic directories (sys-payment-processor-EP).  </p>
  <p style="margin-left: 48px;">For Electronic Payments, the following options would be different per company:</p>
  <p style="margin-left: 48px;">APIPin<br/>
    APIKey<br/>
    PMBillingPaymentCode  </p>
  <p style="margin-left: 48px;">Optionally, the directory option may be used to keep the Electronic Payment logs separated by company. Remember that these subdirectories MUST EXIST on the main SAMPro directory containing the SAMPro executable.  </p>

  <h3>6.7.2a Registry to Disable Automatic Use of Payment Alias in Create PM Billings</h3>
  <p>Some clients would only like their Credit Card Alias to be used when paying specific invoices in the AR Cash Receipt Journal, and not used automatically for PM Billing. The following registry may be enabled to prevent Start Create PM Billing from using existing Credit Cared Alias for billing for the specified AR Terms in the Job record.</p>
  <p><span style="font-weight: bold;">Id:</span> sys-start-scrtepmbllng</p>
  <p><span style="font-weight: bold;">Setting Key:</span> ARTermsExceptions   <span style="font-weight: bold;">Setting Value:</span> <span style="font-style: italic;">ARTermsId1,ARTermsId2,etc.</span>  </p>

  <p style="margin-left: 48px; text-decoration: underline; ">Example: Exclude Jobs with AR Terms of 30,60, 90 and blank</p>
  <p style="margin-left: 48px;">Note: see value of ,, in the list below (this would process jobs with a blank AR Terms Id (if desirable)).</p>

  <h3>6.7.3 Client Site Viewer - Generating a Payment Alias for PM Work Orders</h3>
  <p><img alt="" border="0" src="assets/images/PaymentAlias.bmp" style="border: none;"/></p>
  <p>This button establishes a Payment Alias with OpenEdge <span>or Electronic Payments </span>if this functionality is implemented in your system.   This Alias will be used when PM Invoices are generated to automatically bill the customer&#39;s credit card. The system will post successfully paid billings to the Sales Journal as paid and generate the appropriate AR Cash Receipts Journal Entry. The Alias may be set in the Client Site record or the Master Contract Site List tab.</p>
  <h5>Electronic Payments</h5>
  <p style="margin-left: 48px;">1.Verify that the customer has their credit card ready, and then click this button to enter the customer&#39;s credit card information.</p>
  <p style="margin-left: 48px;">2. SAMPro will open a &#39;Please Enter Credit Card Information&#39; prompter box.  Enter the customer&#39;s credit card number (without spaces or dashes), expiration date and CVC security code. The Pre Auth Amount field will be set to $1.00 to ensure that the credit card is valid. Click OK to continue.</p>
  <p style="margin-left: 48px;">3. A progress bar will appear as the pre-authorization is processed. If the card is not approved, an error with the reason will be displayed (e.g, &quot;Credit Card has expired). Check the number and expiration date and try submitting it again.</p>
  <p style="margin-left: 48px;">4. When the card is approved, the system will write the Alias back to the Payment Alias field, and complete the CC Masked Account and Expiration Date fields for future reference. A secure note detailing the transaction will be attached to the Master Contract record.</p>
  <p style="margin-left: 48px;">5. Save the Client Site.</p>
  <p style="font-weight: bold;"><span>Payment Alias:</span><br/>
    <span id="BugEvents1131" style="font-weight: normal;">This field is completed by the system when a Payment Alias is successfully generated by OpenEdge or Electronic Payments via the Payment Alias button. The Payment Alias may be cleared by manually by blanking the field. This would be done if the client changed their mind and did not wish to have their recurring PM&#39;s paid via credit card. Validation also prevents the user from manually changing this field to a non-blank value; this field may only be set via the Payment Alias button.</span>
  </p>
  <p><span style="font-weight: bold;">CC Masked Account (first four and last four digits of the credit card)<br/>
      CC Expiration Date  CC Trx Id:</span><br/>
    These display fields are completed when an Alias is successfully generated by the credit card processor. Note that Electronic Payments list the first four and last four digits; Open Edge lists only the last four.</p>
  <p>Previously, Open Edge’s logic expected a Payment Alias to be on Master Contract record&#39;s Site children when a Payment Alias is unlikely to be on the child line. The 9.1.611.062 update corrects this defect. Now, the logic is changed to account for when the Payment Alias, used in combination with a Master Contract and Site, is not the Payment Alias on the Site&#39;s Master Contract child line. <br/>
     </p>
  <h3>6.7.4 Master Contract Site List Tab</h3>
  <p>The Payment Alias button in the Magnify view of the Site List tab supports Electronic Payment processing as described in the Client Site above.</p>
  <h3>6.7.5 AR Cash Receipts Electronic Payments Credit Card Processing</h3>
  <p>If you have established an account with Electronic Payments and enabled the appropriate registries, you may process a credit card payment <span>or refund</span> in the AR Cash Receipts Journal.</p>
  <h5>Processing Receipts with Electronic Payments</h5>
  <p>1. If you use a different sweep account for Electronic Payments receipts, change the Bank Account on the GL tab.</p>
  <p>2. On the Main tab, select Invoice or Invoices that the customer wishes to pay for.</p>
  <p>3. Enter the Discount (if any) and Total Receipt; this is the amount that will be processed on the credit card.</p>
  <p><img alt="" border="0" src="assets/images/Process Payment.bmp" style="border: none;"/></p>
  <p>4. Verify that the customer has their credit card ready, and then click the Process Payment button.</p>
  <p>5. SAMPro will open a &#39;Please Enter Credit Card Information&#39; prompter box.  Enter the customer&#39;s credit card number (without spaces or dashes), expiration date and CVC security code and click OK.</p>
  <p>6 A progress bar will appear as the payment is processed. If the card is not approved,an error with the reason will be displayed (e.g, &quot;Credit Card has expired).  . Check the number and expiration date and try submitting it again.</p>
  <p>7. When the payment is approved, the system will write the Approval Code back to the Check Number field, and complete the CC Masked Account field for future reference.<span> A secure note will be added to the journal entry detailing the transaction. </span></p>
  <p style="margin-left: 8px;">8. When preparing to enter the next Cash Receipt, remember to set the GL Bank Account to the appropriate value.</p>
  <p style="margin-left: 48px;">Note: For Cash Receipt Transactions, SAMPro will also send the SAMPro user ID to column &quot;User ID&quot; of export, and sent the User Def 1 to the Client Id.</p>
  <h5>Processing Credit Refunds</h5>
  <p style="margin-left: 48px;"><span style="font-weight: bold;">Electronic Payment Returns:</span><br/>
    By default, Electronic Payments does NOT process returns. In order to do so, the Return option must be enabled in the Merchant Console.</p>
  <p>1. Select a Credit Memo in the AR Cash Receipts Journal, and enter the Total Receipt as a negative number.</p>
  <p>2. Verify that the customer has their credit card ready, and then click the Process Payment button.</p>
  <p>3. When the &#39;Please Enter Credit Card Information&#39; prompter box appears, enter the customer&#39;s credit card number (without spaces or dashes), expiration date and CVC security code and click OK.</p>
  <p>4. If the card is approved, the customer&#39;s card will be credited with the refund.  If it is not approved, check the number and expiration date and try submitting it again.</p>
  <h3>6.7.6 Recent Updates - Electronic Payments USAepay Credit Card Processing</h3>
  <p>In previous releases, Custom Field details were only passed to USAePay when credit processing was executed from a work order.  In 9.1.611.058d and up, these Custom Fields are passed to USAePay when possible on AR Cash Receipts Transactions:<br/>
    •    The User Id and the Client Id are passed on every AR Cash Receipt transaction.  <br/>
    •    If there is only one invoice in the ARCR, then the Invoice, Site and Work Order Id’s are included. <br/>
    •    When there are multiple invoices included in a Cash Receipt transaction, the word &quot;multiple&quot; is used. <br/>
    Note: This enhancement is supported for transactions when the Payment Alias is used as well as when card is manually entered.</p>
  <p>Version 9.1.611.057 prevents the timeout loop from continuing if <b style="box-sizing: border-box; color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 0.9); font-family: &#39;Segoe UI VSS &#39;, , &#39;Segoe UI&#39;, -apple-system, BlinkMacSystemFont, Roboto, &#39;Helvetica Neue&#39;, Helvetica, Ubuntu, Arial, sans-serif, &#39;Apple Color Emoji&#39;, &#39;Segoe UI Emoji&#39;, &#39;Segoe UI Symbol&#39;;

  <p>In Version 9.1.611.058e and up, Client Sites with special characters (&amp;, characters with accent marks) in the Client Site name will no longer error during credit card processing.</p>
  <p>In Version 9.1.611.056, SAMPro no longer attempts to replace the Payment Type Id the user entered when making a payment using an existing Electronic Payments Alias. This corrects an error if the Pay Type is a required field.<span style="font-weight: bold;"> </span></p>
  <p style="margin-left: 8px;">Error Processing: In an earlier release, when a bad credit card number is entered to process a payment an improved message will be displayed in a Workspace file: “An Electronic Payments Error Response Code of E with description of Error was received processing payment.”  Additional information on the exact error (e.g. Credit Card Number was not between 13 and 16 digits) will be displayed. The AR Cash Receipt journal will remain open without processing the payment.</p>
  <p style="margin-left: 8px;">AR Cash Receipts (using Alias), Start Create PM Billing, WO COD Tab: This release adds the Client Site Name and Client Name to the Custom Data section on the USAepay Transaction details when the Payment Alias is used.<span style="font-weight: bold;">  </span></p>
  <h2><span style="font-weight: bold;">6.8 </span>Start Alias Update</h2>
  <h3>Purpose:</h3>
  <p>A new Starter function, Start Alias Update, has been added to this release. The purpose of this function is to copy the credit card Alias information from one Site to other Sites sharing the same Client Id on the Site&#39;s COP tab. The Alias, Masked Credit Card Number, and Expiration Date will be copied. Only Sites with an existing Alias AND COP Client are eligible for selection.</p>
  <p style="margin-left: 48px;"><span style="font-weight: bold;">Setup Note:</span> Start Function List Update must be run to make this function available from the Starter menu if a data conversion was not triggered with this update. This function would be assigned to specified User Groups.</p>
  <h3>Initial Range Screen</h3>
  <p><span style="font-weight: bold;">Site Id: Site Name:</span><br/>
    When the Starter is run, the initial screen requires the user to select the Site that contains the Alias to be copied. If this function was launched from the Copy Alias to Sites button on the Client Site Main tab, the Site will be completed for you.</p>
  <p style="font-weight: bold; margin-left: 8px;">Client Id:  Client Name:<br/>
    <span style="font-weight: normal;">These display fields default from the Client on the Site&#39;s COP tab.</span>
  </p>
  <p><span style="font-weight: bold;">Payment Alias - Masked CC Number - CC Expiration Date</span><br/>
    These display fields default from the selected Site. This information will be copied to the sites you select on the next checklist screen.</p>
  <p><img alt="" border="0" src="assets/images/image/SKIN1_Go.gif" style="border: none;"/> When the user confirms that the correct Site was selected, they should click Go.</p>
  <h3>Checklist Screen:</h3>
  <p style="font-weight: bold;">Ok - Site Id - Site Name - Payment Alias -  Masked CC Number - Expiration<br/>
    <span style="font-weight: normal;">The checklist of eligible Sites with a matching COP Client displays that Site&#39;s current Alias and CC fields.</span>  
  </p>
  <p>The Sites to be updated with the selected Alias (from the previous screen) should have the Ok box(s) checked. Double-click the Ok box to toggle between checked and cleared.</p>
  <p><img alt="" border="0" src="assets/images/image/SKIN1_Check.gif" style="border: none;"/> Click the Check button to check (select) every item on the list.</p>
  <p><img alt="" border="0" src="assets/images/image/SKIN1_CheckOff.gif" style="border: none;"/>  Click to de-select every eligible item on the list</p>
  <p><img alt="" border="0" src="assets/images/image/SKIN1_Go.gif" style="border: none;"/> When Go is clicked from the Checklist the selected Sites will be updated with the revised Alias, Masked CC Number and Expiration Date.</p>
  <h3>6.8.1 Client Site Main Tab</h3>
  <p><img alt="" border="0" src="assets/images/CopyAlias.bmp" style="border: none;"/>  This new button may clicked to launch the Start Alias Update function with the Client Site filled in. This function is used to copy the Alias and Credit Cart information from the selected Site to other Sites sharing the same COP tab Client Id.  The user is warned if the launching Site does not have the COP Client completed.</p>
  <p>In previous versions, failed payment alerts produced a long and vague notification. In version 9.1.611.059 and up, payment failure now has a more specific error message. </p>
  <h2>6.9 AR Terms Viewer</h2>
  <p><span style="font-weight: bold;">Changed Field: Discount Percent</span><br/>
    The AR Terms viewer now displays the Discount Percent as 000.00 but validation will prevent setting the decimal places unless the above registry is set. Validation also controls the hundreds / tens settings (XX0.00) in AR Terms when the registry is set.<span style="font-weight: bold;"> See Customer Note 6.1.5 for details.</span></p>
  <h1>7. Work Breakdown Structure (WBS) Budgeting and Invoicing</h1>
  <h2>7.1 WBS Overview</h2>
  <p>A W<b><span style="font-weight: normal;">ork Breakdown Structure (WBS) provides a means of decomposing a</span> <span style="font-weight: normal;">construction</span></b> project into smaller components that organizes the team&#39;s work into manageable sections. In SAMPro, the following records are available for the categorization of time, materials and other expenses of a Job.  </p>
  <p><img alt="" border="0" src="assets/images/image/WBS1.PNG" style="border: none;"/></p>
  <p><img alt="" border="0" src="assets/images/SKIN1_ImportWBS.bmp" style="border: none;"/> This button launches the WBS/Budget import function for construction billing from the Job record&#39;s Budget Entry tab.  When launched, it imports a file or reads a database table looking for data that hasn’t been previously imported. When found, if budget information for the job exists, the user will be given the option to replace the existing WBS/Budget information or append the new data to the existing WBS/Budget.</p>
  <p>The WBS Configurator analytic allows the Project Manager to re-align Cost Codes and Billing Items.  When this happens, Job History Billing Item may need to get reset. This functionality has been extended to the Job Viewer&#39;s WBS Import button.  When this button is clicked, the Compute JCH Unbilled Revenue is automatically run so that when a Job Billing Item is created or updated the Cost Code and Billing Items will be re-aligned if needed.</p>
  <p>If no budget exists, the system will create new Job Cost Codes based on the WBS information provided and create job cost budget entries for the associated costs.</p>
  <p class="MsoListParagraphCxSpMiddle">If a budget exists and “append” is selected, the system will create any new Job Cost Codes found in the data and create job cost budget entries for the associated costs.</p>
  <p class="MsoListParagraphCxSpMiddle">If a budget exists and “replace” is selected, the system will delete all Job Cost Codes (that don’t have actual costs posted in JC History), delete all existing job budget entries, mark the date closed on any “orphaned” (has actual cost) Job Cost Codes and then create new Job Cost Codes based on the WBS information provided and create job cost budget entries for the associated costs.</p>
  <p class="MsoListParagraphCxSpMiddle">The Import will clear the Cost Code&#39;s Date Completed when the following conditions are true:</p>
  <p class="MsoListParagraphCxSpMiddle" style="margin-left: 48px;">1. Cost Code record already exists in SAMPro.<br/>
    2. The existing Cost Code record has no budget prior to the import.</p>
  <h5>Cost Code Creation Details</h5>
  <p class="MsoListParagraphCxSpMiddle">When the WBS Import creates a new Cost Code, the defaulting of its Work Type is as follows: Set the Cost Code&#39;s Work Type to Field only if both the Skill and Discipline both have Work Types of Field. Otherwise, the Cost Code has its Work Type set to Office.</p>
  <p class="MsoListParagraphCxSpMiddle">When creating new Cost Codes, the system will set the Certified PR flag to True whenever the Cost Code work type is set to Field.  The Cost Category Usage Filter from the Discipline User2 field when creating new Cost Codes.</p>
  <p class="MsoListParagraphCxSpMiddle" style="line-height: 110%;">For new Cost Codes determined to be of type Field:</p>
  <p class="MsoListParagraphCxSpMiddle" style="margin-left: 48px; line-height: 110%;">When the Job&#39;s CIP Discount % is not zero, set the Cost Code&#39;s CIP Discount flag equal to checked<br/>
    Set the Cost Code&#39;s Certified PR Report flag equal to checked<br/>
    Set the CIP Discount flag to checked</p>
  <p class="MsoListParagraphCxSpMiddle">When the WBS has changed, &#39;orphaned&#39; Job Cost Codes will have their Date Closed set so then can no longer be used for data entry.</p>
  <p class="MsoListParagraphCxSpMiddle" style="margin-left: 8px;">Unique Job Cost Codes Id&#39;s defined in the import will specify levels 1-4 of the WBS Structure to ensure data entry consistency. The spreadsheet structure includes a header line. The columns are defined as follows:</p>
  <p class="MsoListParagraphCxSpMiddle" style="margin-left: 48px;">Column 1: Cost Code Id</p>
  <p class="MsoListParagraphCxSpMiddle" style="margin-left: 48px;">Column 2: Cost Code Name</p>
  <p class="MsoListParagraphCxSpMiddle" style="margin-left: 48px;">Column 3: Bld/Floor (Cost Code Level 1)</p>
  <p class="MsoListParagraphCxSpMiddle" style="margin-left: 48px;">Column 4: Area (Cost Code Level 2)</p>
  <p class="MsoListParagraphCxSpMiddle" style="margin-left: 48px;">Column 5: Discipline</p>
  <p class="MsoListParagraphCxSpMiddle" style="margin-left: 48px;">Column 6: Skill</p>
  <h5>Job Billing Item Creation Details</h5>
  <p>If needed Job Billing Items will also be created during the import using the Standard Schedule of Values (see Customer Note 7.3). If a Billing Item cannot be determined during the import and a combination is not found in the SoV table, the system will create and set the Billing Item Id to a default value “Unassigned”.</p>
  <p style="line-height: 110%;">When the Job&#39;s Contract Type is Lump Sum, set the Billing Item&#39;s Fixed Fee Billing flag equal to True.</p>
  <p style="line-height: 110%;">When the Job&#39;s Contract Type is GMP*, set the Billing Item&#39;s Include in GMP flag equal to True.</p>
  <p style="line-height: 110%;">The Billing Item Ok to Bill, Fixed Fee Billing, and Include in GMP flags will be set based on the Job Contract Type as follows:</p>
  <p style="line-height: 110%; margin-left: 48px;">Unknown: Ok to Bill = blank, Fixed Fee = blank, GMP = blank<br/>
    Lump Sum: Ok to Bill = checked, Fixed Fee = checked, GMP = blank<br/>
    T&amp;M: Ok to Bill = checked, Fixed Fee = blank, GMP = blank<br/>
    GMP Cost Plus: Ok to Bill = checked, Fixed Fee = blank, <span style="line-height: 110%;"> = checked<br/>
      GMP Cost Plus: Ok to Bill = checked, Fixed Fee = blank, GMP = checked</span></p>

  <h3>7.2.4 WBS Import Registry to Specify Fee Code</h3>
  <p>The Job viewer&#39;s WBS Import process also needs to know which of the specific Cost Codes should be marked as the &#39;Fee Code&#39;.  The following registry is used to enable this functionality.</p>
  <p><span style="font-weight: bold;">Id:</span> sys-viewer-vjb</p>
  <p><span style="font-weight: bold;">Setting Key:</span> ImportWBSFeeCodeCodeId   <span style="font-weight: bold;">Setting Value:</span>  JobCostCodeId</p>
  <p>When BOTH this registry and the sys-viewer-vjbprgrss registry&#39;s LumpSumUsrFldNmbr options are present, the selected user-definable field will be marked with either a Y or N to indicate which of the cost codes is the &#39;Fee Code&#39;.</p>
  <h3>7.2.5 WBS Import  Registry to Implement Optional Job Cost Burdening by Cost Code (Fab Shop Burden)</h3>
  <p>This release modifies the WBS Import function so that when it auto creates WBS Codes (Job Cost Codes) the Hourly Burden will be pre-set based on defaults established in this registry entry (if enabled). The registry allows the setting of default Hourly Burden rates based on a combination of Branch and Discipline.  In addition, this release modifies the posting logic used to create job cost labor and associated G/L accrual entries to support positing of the Hourly Burden to the G/L based on rules set in an Earnings Id specified in the new registry. Default Earning Id’s are based on the specified Branch id’s.</p>
  <p><span style="font-weight: bold;">Registry Id:</span>  sys-behavior-CostCodeLaborBurden</p>
  <p><span style="font-weight: bold;">Registry Name:</span> Define Use of Cost Code Labor Burden Rates</p>
  <p><span style="font-weight: bold;">Setting Key:</span> ApplyCostCodeHourlyBurden  <span style="font-weight: bold;">Setting Value:</span> true  </p>
  <p><span style="font-weight: bold;">Setting Key:</span> AddPayRateFactor   <span style="font-weight: bold;">Setting Value:</span> true</p>
  <p><span style="font-weight: bold;">Setting Key:</span> <span style="font-style: italic;">BranchId~DisciplineId</span>    <span style="font-weight: bold;">Setting Value:</span> <span style="font-style: italic;">laborburdenrate,EarningId</span></p>
  <p>A separate line for each applicable Branch and Disciple combination should be set up. The Setting Key consists of the Branch Id (from the Job) and the Disciple Id from the Cost Code separated by a tilde (~).</p>
  <p>The Setting Values are a combination of the hourly labor burden rate (in dollars) and the special Earnings Id separated by a comma.</p>
  <p style="margin-left: 48px;">Example:</p>
  <p style="margin-left: 48px;">Setting Key: Cleveland~HVAC   Setting Value: 35,BurdenHVAC</p>
  <p style="margin-left: 48px;">For every Employee applying time the Cost Code generated with this configuration, a &#39;virtual&#39; Employee Earnings line is included in the costings calculations. Values from the Earnings record are processed like any other burden-type Earnings line.</p>
  <p style="font-weight: bold;">Important Notes on Other Registries:</p>
  <p>1. The labor rate methodology implemented in the following registry <span style="font-weight: bold;">must</span> also be enabled:</p>
  <p style="margin-left: 48px;">Id: sys-ffv-global-settings</p>
  <p style="margin-left: 48px;">Setting Key:  LaborRatesAndAccrualMethod  Setting Value: 7687</p>
  <p>2. Other labor rate calculation methodologies must be explicitly disabled.  </p>
  <h3>7.2.6 Registry to Set Job Cost Code&#39;s GL Entity from Discipline Id During WBS Import</h3>
  <p style="margin-left: 8px;">When a new Job Cost Code is created in during the WBS Import, the GL Entity is set by default from the Job Entity on the Job&#39;s Financial tab. The following registry may be used to specify that the Cost Code&#39;s GL Entity instead comes from the Discipline Id specified in the Import.  </p>
  <p style="margin-left: 8px;"><span style="font-weight: bold;">Id:</span> sys-viewer-vjb</p>
  <p style="margin-left: 8px;"><span style="font-weight: bold;">Setting Key:</span> ForWBSGetEntityFromDiscipline    <span style="font-weight: bold;">Setting Value:</span> true  (default is false)</p>
  <p style="margin-left: 8px;">Note that if the WBS import is being used to <span style="font-weight: bold;">update existing</span> Job Cost Codes, the GL Entity will be left alone, regardless of whether or not this registry is set.</p>
  <h3>7.2.7 Registry to Prompt for Cost Codes Certified PR Flag Setting</h3>
  <p>Previously when creating new Cost Codes via the Job viewer&#39;s WBS Import function, the Cost Codes Certified PR Flag would always be checked if the work type was set to field. The following registry allows a change this default behavior to allow a prompt to be displayed to allow control the setting of the Cost Codes Certified PR Flag.</p>
  <p><span style="font-weight: bold;">Registry Id:</span> sys-viewer-vjb</p>
  <p><span style="font-weight: bold;">Setting Key:</span> promptForJobRequireCertifiedPayroll</p>
  <p><span style="font-weight: bold;">Setting Value:</span> true,false (default is false,false)</p>
  <p>The first true/false in the setting value is whether to display the prompt at all, which asks if the job requires certified payroll. The second true/false is the default answer (Yes or No) to the prompt, which can be changed at time of prompt.</p>
  <p>There is a hierarchy at play. The system will first look to existing cost codes before evaluating the registry setting. If the existing cost codes have the Certified PR flag set (or at least a majority), the prompt appears, set to Yes. If NO Certified PR flags are set in existing cost codes, the prompt will not appear and Certified PR Flag will not be set.</p>
  <p>If there are no cost codes, or cost codes have same amount of Certified PR Flags checked and non-checked, the registry setting is evaluated.</p>
  <h2>7.3 Standard Schedule of Values</h2>
  <h3>Purpose:</h3>
  <p>The records in this viewer are used as a model when importing WBS Budget data to define Job Billing records when necessary for &#39;standard&#39; jobs.</p>
  <h3>Usage:</h3>
  <p>Each Standard Schedule of Values record defines a unique combination of a Billing Item Id, Discipline Id, and Skill Id. The table specifies the Billing Item Group, Billing Item Id and Billing Item Name that will be used when importing WBS Budget data for which Billing Items and Cost Codes do not yet exist. During the import, if a combination is not found in the table, the system will create and set the Billing Item Id to a default value “Unassigned”.</p>
  <h3>Important Fields:</h3>
  <p><span style="font-weight: bold;">SoV Id:</span><br/>
    This display-only field will be generated by the system when the record is added.</p>
  <p><span style="font-weight: bold;">Discipline Id:<br/>
      Skill Id:</span><br/>
    Enter the unique Disciple and Skill records that define this record. The Discipline defines the Trade or the type of personnel needed.  Typically, the Discipline is further defined by the Skill. For example, if a Discipline was Pipe Fitting Field Install, the trade Skill would indicate the material of the pipe (e.g., Carbon Steel, Copper, etc.). The Skill may also define the type of material, equipment or subcontractor required.</p>
  <p><span style="font-weight: bold;">SoV Bill Item Id:  SoV Bill Item Description:</span><br/>
    These field provide the text used to generate the Billing Item  and Job Cost Code&#39;s Id and Description when they are created via the WBS Import.</p>
  <p><span style="font-weight: bold;">SoV Billing Item Group:</span><br/>
    These field specifies the text written to the Billing Item Group field (on the Billing Item&#39;s Invoicing tab) when the Billing Item is generated via the WBS Import.</p>
  <p style="font-weight: bold;">SoV User 1-5:<br/>
    <span style="font-weight: normal;">These fields are used to update the Job Billing Item User fields 1 thru 5 during the processing of the WBS Import.</span>
  </p>
  <p><span style="font-weight: bold;">Obsolete:</span><br/>
    Reserved for future use.</p>
  <h2>7.4  Discipline Viewer</h2>
  <p>In Version 9.1, the Discipline record is also referenced in the Standard Schedule of Values for use with the WBS Budget Import functionality in the Job record. When used in this fashion, the Discipline may be further defined by the Skill. For example, if a Discipline was Pipe Fitting Field Install, the trade Skill would indicate the material of the pipe (e.g., Carbon Steel, Copper, etc.).</p>
  <p style="font-weight: bold;">New Field - Work Type: n/a - Office - Field<br/>
    <span style="font-weight: normal;">This new field supports the WBS Budget Import&#39;s creation of new Job Cost Codes using the Standard Schedule of Values.  When the Import creates a new Cost Code, the defaulting of its Work Type is as follows: Set the Cost Code&#39;s Work Type to Field only if both the Skill and Discipline (in the Schedule of Values) both have Work Types of Field. Otherwise, the Cost Codes has its Work Type set to Office.</span>
  </p>
  <p>The n/a option may be used as a placeholder during data conversion.</p>
  <p><span style="font-weight: bold;">Changed Field: Discipline User2:</span><br/>
    The WBS Import sets the Cost Category Usage Filter from the Discipline User2 field when creating new Cost Codes.</p>
  <h2>7.5 Skill Viewer</h2>
  <p>In Version 9.1, the Skill record is also referenced in the Standard Schedule of Values for use with the WBS Budget Import functionality in the Job record. When used in this fashion, the Skill would typically indicate a further breakout of detail applied to the trade Discipline. For example, if a Discipline was Pipe Fitting Field Install, the Skill would indicate the material of the pipe (e.g., Carbon Steel, Copper, etc.).</p>
  <p><span style="font-weight: bold;">New Field - Work Type: n/a - Office - Field</span><br/>
    This new field supports the WBS Budget Import&#39;s creation of new Job Cost Codes using the Standard Schedule of Values.  When the Import creates a new Cost Code, the defaulting of its Work Type is as follows: Set the Cost Code&#39;s Work Type to Field only if both the Skill and Discipline (in the Schedule of Values) both have Work Types of Field. Otherwise, the Cost Codes has its Work Type set to Office.</p>
  <h2>7.6 WBS Viewer</h2>
  <h3>Purpose:</h3>
  <p>This records in this viewer are typically generated when a WBS budget is generated via the Import WBS button in the Job Budget Entry tab.</p>
  <h2>7.7 WBS Contingency Viewer</h2>
  <h3>Purpose:</h3>
  <p>The WBS Contingency table is used by the WBS Configurator Analytic for validating combinations of Discipline, Skill and Cost Category.  It has no use within SAMPro itself. Although a standard SAMPro viewer has been implemented, the data in this table will be imported initially and most likely remain unchanged.</p>
  <h2>Important Fields:</h2>
  <p><span style="font-weight: bold;">WBS Contingency Id:</span><br/>
    This field will be generated by the system when a record is added.</p>
  <p><span style="font-weight: bold;">Discipline Id:  Skill Name: Cost Category:</span><br/>
    These fields define allowable Discipline, Skill and Job Cost Category which may be selected in the WBS Configurator. This combination must be unique within the WBS Contingency table.</p>
  <h2>7.8 Recent WBS Updates</h2>
  <p><span style="font-weight: bold;">Job Viewer - WBS Import: </span>Prior to this release there was a discrepancy between the WBS Import function and the WBS Configuration tool in DBAnalytics. The former would use a multiplier during the import, and the latter would use the unit price when creating budget lines. This became an issue when budget lines were changed mid process. Revenue rates were not properly calculated. In this release the Revenue Rate is the ratio of Unit Price to Unit Cost which eliminates erroneous calculations.</p>
  <p><span style="font-weight: bold;">Start WBS Import</span>: Corrects a sporadic issue where budget lines were lost over time.</p>

  <h1>8 Job / Job Costing</h1>
  <h2>8.1 Job Related Registries</h2>
  <h3>8.1.1  Registry to Disable Job Record Budget Reversals for WBS Import</h3>
  <p><span style="font-weight: bold;">This option should ONLY be implemented if the WBS Configurator/Import process is being used to import Job Budget Entry child lines.</span> See Customer Release Note 7.2.1 for details.</p>
  <h3>8.1.2  Job Journal Registry to Change the Cost Code ~ Cost Category Validation Error into a Warning</h3>
  <p>The following registry may be used to change the Cost Code ~ Cost Category Validation error into a warning.</p>
  <p style="margin-left: 48px;"><span style="font-weight: bold;">Important:</span><br/>
    This registry should <span style="font-weight: bold;">only</span> be enabled for only special accounting department users so they can make adjustments to previously posted JCH independent of the new rules.</p>
  <p><span style="font-weight: bold;">Id:</span> sys-viewer-vjbjrnl</p>
  <p><span style="font-weight: bold;">Setting Key:</span> CostCategoryUsageValidationType   </p>
  <p><span style="font-weight: bold;">Setting Value:</span> warning  (default error)</p>
  <p>The Job Journal supports enhanced filtering provided by the Cost Code&#39;s Job Cost Category Usage Filter. Cost Categories are validated (relative to Cost Codes) during data entry upon leaving the Cost Category Id field.  The full relationship is validated again when leaving a child line or saving a record.  This registry controls whether a violation of the Cost Category Usage Validations is treated as an error (the default) or a warning (which warns the user but allows the record to be saved.</p>
  <h3>8.1.3  Job Journal Registry To Require Net Zero Costing on Co.Equip Tab</h3>
  <p><span style="font-weight: bold;">Id:</span> sys-viewer-vjbjrnl</p>
  <p><span style="font-weight: bold;">Setting Key:</span> NetZeroEquipmentCost   <span style="font-weight: bold;">Setting Value:</span> true   (default false)</p>
  <p>This registry impacts the Job Journal&#39;s Co.Equip tab which is used to charge company equipment assets to a Job or Work Order. When enabled, this registry requires that the costs entered on the Co.Equip tab net to zero. This entry provides a means of controlling job cost transfers.</p>
  <h3>8.1.3a Job Journal Registry to Require Work Order for Service Compute Jobs</h3>
  <p>Jobs indicated as &quot;Service Compute&quot; get billed by the Work Order, yet we allow costs to be entered and posted to Jobs w/o reference to any specific work order, leaving these unbilled costs in limbo. This feature may be activated to warn or error if a Work Order is not specified for Jobs flagged as &#39;Service Compute&#39;.</p>
  <p style="margin-left: 48px;"><span style="font-weight: bold;">Note:</span> This setting may also be made globally in the sys-ffv-global-settings registry. If so, the local setting by Journal will trump the global entry.</p>
  <p><span style="font-weight: bold;">Registry Id:</span> sys-viewer-vjbjrnl</p>
  <p><span style="font-weight: bold;">Setting Key:</span> NeedWOInServiceComputeJobs  <span style="font-weight: bold;">Setting Value: </span>Error, Warning or Neither (default Neither)</p>
  <p><span style="font-weight: bold;">W</span>hen the Setting Value is set to <span style="font-weight: bold;">Error</span>, the user will be alerted when leaving a line lacking a Work Order Id and will not be able to save the record. Note that implementing Error on an existing system impacts your ability to edit existing entries. It should be implemented with caution.</p>
  <p>When <span style="font-weight: bold;">Warning</span> is implemented, the user will be alerted when leaving a line lacking a Work Order Id but will be able to save the record.</p>
  <p>If <span style="font-weight: bold;">Neither</span> is implemented (or the registry option does not exist) the user will not be alerted if a Service Compute type Job lacks a Work Order reference.</p>
  <h3>8.1.4 Registry To Prevent Changing Overhead Flag for Jobs With Non-Zero History</h3>
  <p style="margin-left: 8px;">By default, the user is warned when changing the Overhead? flag on a Job which has non-zero Job History based on the JCH Hours, Quantity, Total Cost and Total Revenue fields. The following registry changes the warning to an error to prevent the user from changing the Overhead? flag for Jobs with non-zero history.</p>
  <p style="margin-left: 8px;"><span style="font-weight: bold;">Registry Id:</span> sys-viewer-vjb</p>
  <p style="margin-left: 8px;"><span style="font-weight: bold;">Setting Key:</span> ValidateOverheadChange    <span style="font-weight: bold;">Setting Value:</span> error or warning (default)</p>
  <h3>8.1.5 Job Progress Viewer Registry Option to Allow &gt;100% Complete</h3>
  <p>By default when Actual + Committed equals or exceeds existing Projected Cost, then the Over/Under adjustment is &quot;forced&quot; to bring the projection in line with Actual (Actual + Committed becomes the projection line IS 100% Complete): the following message will appear when a Job with this criteria is accessed:</p>
  <p style="margin-left: 48px;">One or more lines required adjustments to prevent Actual Costs<br/>
    from exceeding Projected Costs.  If you exit this viewer without<br/>
    saving, these adjustments will be discarded and will not appear<br/>
    on subsequently produced job reports.</p>
  <p style="margin-left: 8px;">There may be cases when the Over/Under adjustment should not be forced: for example, assume that a budget line has more actual cost than budgeted, but revising the &quot;projected costs&quot; to the higher value is NOT desired. Perhaps there is material on site that is expected to be returned, vendor credit or rebates expected to be realized in the future, etc.  This new registry allows the system to reflect &gt;100% complete with a negative CostToComplete &quot;projection&quot;.  An additional option allows the user to control the message which appears on the new Messages column on the Job Progress Viewer child tab.</p>
  <p style="margin-left: 48px;">NOTE: The system will NOT automatically calculate the Over/Under Adjustments for you when this registry is in effect!</p>

    Setting Value: WARNING: Actual &gt; Projected</p>
  <h3>8.1.6 Custom PM WorkBench (Job Progress Functionality)</h3>
  <p>Certain Custom PM Workbench analytics depend on knowing which of a job&#39;s Cost Codes is designated as the &#39;Fee Code&#39;. This analytic uses the following registry to determine which of the Cost Code User fields is being used (typically the User4 field).</p>
  <p><span style="font-weight: bold;">Id:</span> sys-viewer-vjbprgrss</p>
  <p><span style="font-weight: bold;">Setting Key:</span> LumpSumUsrFldNmbr   <span style="font-weight: bold;">Setting Value:</span> 4   (1,2 or 3 are also permitted)</p>
  <p>In this case, the Job Cost User User4 field should be set to Y if it is designated as the &#39;Fee Code&#39; record or N if it is not.</p>
  <p>See Customer Note 7.2.4 for a related registry.</p>
  <h3>8.1.7 Prevent Copy From Client Button from Setting Job&#39;s Sales Tax Group from Client</h3>
  <p>The Job Viewer&#39;s Copy From Client button has been changed so that the Sales Tax Group, Service Zone and Branch will be set from the Zipcode table (if enabled) for the Client&#39;s Zipcode. For Commercial / Industrial Jobs, this is not desirable. The following registry changes default behavior so that only Client Address fields are set when Job viewer&#39;s Copy From Client button is clicked.</p>
  <p><span style="font-weight: bold;">Registry Id:</span> sys-viewer-vjb</p>
  <p><span style="font-weight: bold;">Setting Key:</span> JustSetAddressFromClient   <span style="font-weight: bold;"> Setting Value:</span> true     (default false)</p>
  <h3>8.1.8 Registry to Control Cost of Goods Sold Account by Cost Type in Job EOM Process</h3>
  <p>In previous releases the registry entry (sys-job-eom) setting key GLCOS  to specify the Cost of Goods Sold account was only applied as a rule of last resort.  For Inventory, the Expense Acct might come from the Inventory Group depending on registry settings and other conditions.  Otherwise, the normal progression for all cost types is (1) Cost Category; (2) Cost Code: (3) &#39;glcos&#39; registry setting; (4) the Vendor record; (5) nothing.</p>
  <p>In this release, the following registry settings trump ALL of the above defaulting for the Cost of Goods Sold when this function is run. They allow the Cost Of Goods Sold to be specified by DIRECT assignment of COS GL Account by cost type, to support greater flexibility in configuration.</p>
  <p>This is particularly necessary to define a specific rule for COS Labor to circumvent the skew that is inevitable if BURDEN is being carried in Labor Cost.</p>

  <h3>8.1.8a Skip Unapproved CO&#39;s in Job EOM</h3>
  <p>This release implements a new registry setting which, when set, skips Change Orders that haven&#39;t yet been approved. If this entry is not in place,  Change Orders are included in the calculation for revenue recognition even if the Change Order was not approved until the next accounting period.</p>

  <h3>8.1.9 Registry to set Cloned Job&#39;s Branch from Site instead of Job  </h3>
  <p>By default,when a Job is cloned via the Clone Job button in the Job record, the new Job&#39;s Branch Id defaults from the Job (or Job Template) it was cloned from.  If the following registry is enabled, the new Job&#39;s Branch will be derived from the Site selected in the Clone Job wizard.</p>

  <h3>8.1.10 Registry for Small Jobs Processing Modification to use Job Date Completed</h3>
  <p>This release supports a enhancement to the way Small Jobs processing is handled. Instead of using the Job Date Closed as the trigger date for Small Jobs revenue recognition, the Date Completed will be used instead. The Job&#39;s Date Completed field is implemented via the v.cus file as a special, non-database field that is used to update a Job User field (specified via registry), ensuring that the Job User field is set to the correct date format.  Note that a revised v.cus file is required to support this functionality.</p>
  <p>In addition to the customized v.cus file with the Job Date Completed, the following registry is also required to define the Job User field used to sort the Date Completed.</p>
  <p><span style="font-weight: bold;">Registry Id:</span> sys-viewer-vjb</p>
  <p><span style="font-weight: bold;">Setting Key:</span> DateCompletedUserField   <span style="font-weight: bold;">Setting Value:</span> 4</p>
  <p>The following validation has been added when changing the new Job Date Completed field:</p>
  <p>Change from Original Blank Date To New Non-Blank Date (OK)</p>
  <p>Change from Original Non-Blank Date to New Non-Blank Date within same Accounting Period (OK)</p>
  <p>If New Job Date Completed NOT in same Accounting Period as Original Date Completed:</p>
  <p style="margin-left: 48px;">If Non-Reversing JC EOM Entries found for Original Accounting Period (ERROR)</p>
  <p style="margin-left: 48px;">If Non-Reversing JC EOM Entries NOT found for Original Accounting Period and New Job Date Completed is blank (OK)</p>
  <p style="margin-left: 48px;">If Non-Reversing JC EOM Entries found for Date &gt;= New Job Date Completed (ERROR)</p>
  <h3>8.1.10a Job EOM with Small Jobs - Use Date Completed for Revenue Recognition</h3>
  <p>The following changes have been implemented if the registry/customization changes discussed above in Customer Note 8.1.10 are in effect:</p>
  <p><span style="font-weight: bold;">Job EOM:</span> In this release, the Job Date Completed is used instead of the Job Date Closed when recognizing revenue for Small Jobs when Job EOM is run.</p>
  <p><span style="font-weight: bold;">Job Viewer - Job Date Completed:</span> Validation has been added to prevent the Job Date Completed field to be changed to a date equal or less than any Job EOM entries for that Small Job. Note that the Date Completed field is only displayed if enabled in the customization file.</p>
  <p><span style="font-weight: bold;">Credit PO&#39;s:</span> This release excludes credit-type POs from the unreceived lines tests (GEN and INV). This fix was needed specifically for Small Jobs because part of Small Jobs unique functionality is verifying that all purchases have been received at the time of closing the job. </p>
  <h3>8.1.11 Job Viewer - Allow Projected to Exceed Actual on Job&#39;s JC Summary Tab</h3>
  <p>In previous releases, if the Job went over budget, the Job&#39;s JC Summary tab showed the Projected Values that exceeded the Actual. In this release, Projected will be adjusted to match Actual if Actual &gt; Projected by default.</p>
  <p style="margin-left: 8px;">The previous behavior will be implemented via the following registry:</p>
  <p style="margin-left: 8px;"><span style="font-weight: bold;">Id:</span> sys-viewer-vjb</p>
  <p style="margin-left: 8px;"><span style="font-weight: bold;">Setting Key:</span> ActualCanExceedProjected  <span style="font-weight: bold;">Setting Value:</span> true  (default false)</p>
  <h3>8.1.12 PM Workbench Viewer - Allow Projected to Exceed Actual on JC Summary Tab</h3>
  <p>In previous releases, if the Job went over budget, the Job&#39;s JC Summary tab showed the Projected Values that exceeded the Actual. In this release, Projected will be adjusted to match Actual if Actual &gt; Projected by default.</p>
  <p style="margin-left: 8px;">The previous behavior will be implemented via the following registry:</p>

  <h2>8.2  Job Related Reports</h2>
  <h3><span style="font-weight: bold;">8.2.1 Drilldown Service Profitability Component Report</span></h3>
  <p>The revised component report CSERPFT1.rpt dated 2016-09-28 corrects an error when drilling down from the Drilldown Service Profitability report.</p>
  <h3><span style="font-weight: bold;">8.2.2 Report Job Billing Report (RBLLRPT.rpt)</span></h3>
  <p>The revised report (AKA Report Job Billing Recap) dated 2016-03-31 supports Security Id processing and corrects an issue which caused it to &#39;hang&#39; in some environments.</p>
  <h3>8.2.3 Report Profitability by Client (DCPFTRv73b029.rpt)</h3>
  <p>The revised report dated 2016-10-19 enhances how the billed costs are calculated for the Labor, Material, Other, and Subcontract columns at the Client, Client Site, and Bill Item Summary levels.</p>
  <h3><span style="font-weight: bold;">8.2.4 Report Sales Summary by Sales Rep</span></h3>
  <p>Revised report (RSLSSMMRYSLSRP) dated 2016-12-20 correctly displays the current year&#39;s sales amount if more than one Sales Rep is specified on the Commissions tab of the Job by taking the share percentage into consideration.</p>
  <h3><span style="font-weight: bold;">8.2.5 Report Job Cost Details – Direct</span></h3>
  <p>This new report (RJBDTLDRCT.rpt dated 2016-01-10) resembles the original Report Job Billing Details but skips all overhead jobs in order to prevent typical users from running the report for indirect overhead jobs and seeing confidential data.</p>
  <h3>8.2.6 Report Jobs in Progress</h3>
  <p>Report <strong>RJBPRGRSS</strong> dated 2022-05-26 now includes Accounts Receivable Sales journal transaction types (DEBIT MEMO &amp; BAD DEBT) from the billing calculations.</p>
  <p>The revised report (RJBPRGSS.rpt) dated 2020-11-10 or later includes changes to the standard Detail Line to present JobID and JobName as char(30) concatenation. This allows more of the Job Id to display; previously only the first 10 characters appeared.</p>
  <p>The revised report (RJBPRGRSS.rpt) dated 2017-03-10) replaces the Over/Under Billed column heading w/ Total Billed JTD - Cost JTD.  For Change Orders (Billing Items with the Change Order? box checked), the report now checks the CO Date Approved when determining whether or not to include the CO Amount in the Total Revised Contract: the CO Date Approved must be less than or equal to the report&#39;s Ending Date.</p>
  <h3>8.2.7 Report WIP Summary 2 (% Completion Method)</h3>
  <p><span style="font-weight: normal;">Revised Report WIP Summary2(% Completion Method) (DWIPSUM2.rpt dated 2020-11-30) corrects an issue where the report did not always match when running with and without the Billing Item Detail box checked. Note that a discrepancy may still be observed if the option to skip unapproved change orders is selected since Bill Items with NO Contract value no longer qualify.</span>  </p>
  <h2>8.3  Discipline Viewer</h2>
  <p>In Version 9.1, the Discipline record is also referenced in the Standard Schedule of Values for use with the WBS Budget Import functionality in the Job record. When used in this fashion, the Discipline may be further defined by the Skill. For example, if a Discipline was Pipe Fitting Field Install, the Skill would indicate the material of the pipe (e.g., Carbon Steel, Copper, etc.).</p>
  <p style="font-weight: bold;">New Field - Work Type: n/a - Office - Field<br/>
    <span style="font-weight: normal;">This new field supports the WBS Budget Import&#39;s creation of new Job Cost Codes using the Standard Schedule of Values.  When the Import creates a new Cost Code, the defaulting of its Work Type is as follows: Set the Cost Code&#39;s Work Type to Field only if both the Skill and Discipline (in the Schedule of Values) both have Work Types of Field. Otherwise, the Cost Codes has its Work Type set to Office.</span>
  </p>
  <p>The n/a option may be used as a placeholder during data conversion.</p>
  <h2>8.4 Skill Viewer</h2>
  <p>In Version 9.1, the Skill record is also referenced in the Standard Schedule of Values for use with the WBS Budget Import functionality in the Job record. When used in this fashion, the Skill would typically indicate a further breakout of detail applied to the Discipline. For example, if a Discipline was Pipe Fitting Field Install, the Skill would indicate the material of the pipe (e.g., Carbon Steel, Copper, etc.).</p>
  <p><span style="font-weight: bold;">New Field - Work Type: n/a - Office - Field</span><br/>
    This new field supports the WBS Budget Import&#39;s creation of new Job Cost Codes using the Standard Schedule of Values.  When the Import creates a new Cost Code, the defaulting of its Work Type is as follows: Set the Cost Code&#39;s Work Type to Field only if both the Skill and Discipline (in the Schedule of Values) both have Work Types of Field. Otherwise, the Cost Codes has its Work Type set to Office.</p>
  <h2>8.5 Job Journal</h2>
  <p>A warning is now displayed when the user first accesses a journal entry which has been replaced by one with a higher &#39;tack&#39; number. This warning is designed to prevent the user from wasting time by attempting to make changes to a journal entry record which cannot be saved because it has already been replaced. See Customer Note 1.1.2 for a registry to disable this warning globally or by individual viewer.</p>
  <h3>8.5.1 Job Journal Labor Tab</h3>
  <p><span style="font-weight: bold;">Changed Field - Total Labor Cost:</span><br/>
    Previously, this display field was not promptly updated if the global registry LaborRatesAndAccrualMethod was set to 7687. This field is now correctly updated when the Job Cost Code is entered.</p>
  <p><span style="font-weight: bold;">New Field - Supervisor Id:</span><br/>
    If completed, this field specifies the Supervisor responsible for work in this entry.  </p>
  <p>
    <font style="font-weight: bold;">Changed Field - Cost Category:</font><br/>
    This field now supports enhanced filtering provided by the Cost Code&#39;s Job Cost Category Usage Filter. Cost Categories are validated (relative to Cost Codes) during data entry upon leaving the Cost Category Id field.  The full relationship is validated again when leaving a child line or saving a record.
  </p>
  <p>See Customer Note 8.1.2  for a Job Journal Registry to Change the Cost Code ~ Cost Category Validation Error into a Warning.</p>
  <h3>8.5.2 Job Journal Expenses Tab</h3>
  <p>
    <font style="font-weight: bold;">Changed Field - Cost Category:</font><br/>
    This field now supports enhanced filtering provided by the Cost Code&#39;s Job Cost Category Usage Filter. Cost Categories are validated (relative to Cost Codes) during data entry upon leaving the Cost Category Id field.  The full relationship is validated again when leaving a child line or saving a record.
  </p>
  <p>See Customer Note 8.1.2  for a Job Journal Registry to Change the Cost Code ~ Cost Category Validation Error into a Warning.</p>
  <h3>8.5.3 Job Journal CO Equipment Tab</h3>
  <p><span style="font-weight: bold;">Credit GL Entity</span><br/>
    This release revises the hierarchy for setting the credit-side gl entity using the first non-blank GL Entity Id from:</p>
  <p style="margin-left: 48px;">1.) Asset Id&#39;s OH Job Cost Code GL Entity</p>
  <p style="margin-left: 48px;">2.) Registry UseDefaultBalanceSheetGLEntity   ***see note below</p>
  <p style="margin-left: 48px;">3.) Other Rate Credit GL Entity</p>
  <p style="margin-left: 48px;">4.) Company Default GL Entity</p>
  <p style="margin-left: 48px;">*** If &quot;UseDefaultBalanceSheetGLEntity&quot; = true/enabled; but &quot;DefaultBalanceSheetEntity&quot; value is not defined, blank or disabled....then Company Record Default GL Entity behaves as a STAND-IN as value.</p>
  <p style="margin-left: 48px;">Important: the display-only GL Credit GL Entity field will display the Other Rate&#39;s GL Entity. Note that this may NOT be the Entity that is actually posted to GL.</p>
  <p><span style="font-weight: bold;">Description:</span><br/>
    When the Other Rate Id defaults from the Asset record, the Other Rate&#39;s Description field now populates the Co Equip tab&#39;s Description field.</p>
  <p><span style="font-weight: bold;">Changed Field - Cost Category:</span><br/>
    This field now supports enhanced filtering provided by the Cost Code&#39;s Job Cost Category Usage Filter. Cost Categories are validated (relative to Cost Codes) during data entry upon leaving the Cost Category Id field.  The full relationship is validated again when leaving a child line or saving a record.</p>
  <p>See Customer Note 8.1.2  for a Job Journal Registry to Change the Cost Code ~ Cost Category Validation Error into a Warning.</p>
  <h3>8.5.4 Job Journal  Intercompany Support</h3>
  <p>Job Budgets, Job Labor, Job Expense and Projected Cost now have the Security Id set when created in the Inter-Company model. New validation  requires Job Journal entries for Inter-Company type clients to include 2 or fewer companies on each child tab. The &#39;Parent&#39; company is the company whose GL COS account is credited.</p>
  <p>Previously when a user would edit a Job&#39;s Billing Item by checking or unchecking Allow Extras or checking or unchecking Fixed Fee, it called the ScmpteJCHUnblldRvne function and posted bogus adjustments to the Job Journal based on any changes they had made to the Job&#39;s Rate Schedule. This update corrects this defect. </p>
  <h3>8.5.5 Job Journal Main Tab</h3>
  <p><span style="font-weight: bold;">Total Cost Labor:</span><br/>
    This display field is now updated when the Job Cost Code is entered on the Labor tab.  In previous releases, it was sometimes necessary to tab to the next line in the Labor tab to see the result.</p>
  <p> </p>
  <h2>8.6 Job Record</h2>
  <h3>8.6.1 New Tab: Tax Certificates</h3>
  <p>This new tab allows Sales Tax Certificates to be recorded for informational and reporting purposes.</p>
  <h5>Important Fields:</h5>
  <p><span style="font-weight: bold;">Authority Id:</span><br/>
    The Sales Tax Authority Id.</p>
  <p><span style="font-weight: bold;">Start Date:  End Date:</span><br/>
    Defines the date range this Certificate is valid for (required).</p>
  <p><span style="font-weight: bold;">Certificate Number:</span><br/>
    The number provided by the Tax Authority (required).</p>
  <p><span style="font-weight: bold;">Certificate On File?</span><br/>
    This box should be checked if this Certificate is on file.</p>
  <p><span style="font-weight: bold;">Tax Certificate Description:</span><br/>
    Briefly describes this Certificate.</p>
  <h3>8.6.2 Job Invoicing Tab</h3>
  <p style="font-weight: bold;"><img alt="" border="0" src="assets/images/SKIN1_CopySite.bmp" style="border: none;"/>  <img alt="" border="0" src="assets/images/SKIN1_CopyClient.bmp" style="border: none;"/>  </p>
  <p>In previous releases, manually entering the Job Invoice Address&#39;s Zip Code caused the Sales Tax Group to default on Job&#39;s Main tab (if the Sales Tax Group was specified in the Zip Code table). In this release, this defaulting has been extended to the use of the Copy Client Address or Copy Site Address icons to populate the Invoice Address&#39;s Zip Code.  </p>
  <p style="margin-left: 48px;"><span style="font-weight: bold;">WARNING:</span> Defaulting the Sales Tax Group from the Client record may lead to undesirable results. For most installations, we strongly recommend disabling the default of the Sales Tax Group via the registry setting in Customer Note 8.1.7 so that only the address fields from the Client default.</p>
  <p style="font-weight: bold;">Enhanced Field - Invoice Email To:<br/>
    <span style="font-weight: normal;">Double-clicking this field now brings up a list of potential email addresses from the Site and Client records for the user to select from. Note that only email addresses including the @ symbol will be included on the list. Email Groups will not appear on the list, but may be added manually and enclosed by brackets [emailgroupid].</span>  
  </p>
  <p><span style="font-weight: bold;">Changed Field - Job Invoice Description:</span><br/>
    This field has been expended from 1000 to 3000 characters.</p>
  <h3>8.6.3 Job JC Summary Tab</h3>
  <p>Previously, if the Job went over budget, this tab showed the Projected Values that exceeded the Actual. Projected will now be adjusted to match Actual if Actual &gt; Projected. See Customer Note 8.1.11 for a registry to implement the previous behavior.</p>
  <p>This release corrects a rounding error in computing a negative gross margin.  </p>
  <p>All currency fields have been expanded to display amounts up to $999,999,999 correctly.</p>
  <p>This tab is refreshed correctly when it is selected when the Next - Previous buttons are pushed.</p>
  <h3>8.6.4 Job Record Financial Tab</h3>
  <p><span style="mso-list: l0 level1 lfo1; font-weight: bold;">Financial Tab CIP Discount Percent</span><span style="mso-list: l0 level1 lfo1;"><br/>
      This release refines the support for OCIP/CCIP discounted insurance job costing.</span> <span style="mso-spacerun: yes;"> </span><span style="mso-list: l0 level1 lfo1;">OCIP/CCIP Job Cost Rate Discounts will be implemented only if the CIP Discount? is flagged in the applicable Earnings record AND Job Cost Code record.</span> In the original implementation, all N/A-type earnings were subject to CIP Discounting.  </p>
  <h3>8.6.5 Job Budget Entry Tab</h3>
  <p>This release corrects the problem of Job Budget entries (made directly to Budget tab of Job) posting to JCH with no security in the Intercompany model. This resulted in inaccurate data on the Job Budget Reports RJBBUDG1, RJBBUDG2 and RJBBUDG3. Now all budget lines on the Job record, as well as Job Journal budget entries are posted to JCH with Security Rn, and all Budget reports pull accurate data when run globally, or by Company.</p>
  <p><span style="font-weight: bold;">Changed Field: Cost Category</span><br/>
    This field now supports enhanced filtering provided by the Cost Code&#39;s Job Cost Category Usage Filter. Cost Categories are validated (relative to Cost Codes) during data entry upon leaving the Cost Category Id field.  The full relationship is validated again when leaving a child line or saving a record.</p>
  <p style="font-weight: bold;">New Button:</p>
  <p><img alt="" border="0" src="assets/images/SKIN1_ImportWBS.bmp" style="border: none;"/> This button imports a file or reads a database table looking for data that hasn’t been previously imported. When found, if budget information for the job exists, the user will be given the option to replace the existing WBS/Budget information or append the new data to the existing WBS/Budget. If no budget exists, the system will create new Job Cost Codes based on the WBS information provided and create job cost budget entries for the associated costs.</p>
  <p>See Customer Note 7.1 for additional details.</p>
  <p>Version 9.1.611.053 prevents a divide-by-zero error encountered when doing a WBS Import for a line with budgeted revenue but no cost.  </p>
  <h3>8.6.6 Job List Viewer</h3>
  <p>A new index has been added to the Job list view, JobByClientIdBySiteId which include the Site Id. When this index is selected, the following fields are displayed: Client Id - Site Id - Job Id - Job Name - Client Name - PO #</p>
  <p>The Job Date Closed has been added to the JobByIdByName option to the right of Job Alpha Id.</p>
  <p>The new JobByProjectDescriptionByJobId option on the Job List&#39;s Sort Order Pane displays these columns: Project Description - Project Id - Job Id - Job Name - Site Id - Site Name</p>
  <h3>8.6.7 Job Billing Item Tab</h3>
  <p style="font-weight: bold;">New Columns: PM%Earned -  PM$Earned - &#39;PM$NextInv - PMStatus<br/>
    <span style="font-weight: normal;">These new columns display values submitted from the Web PMWB</span>
  </p>
  <p><span style="font-weight: bold;">New Column: CO Request</span><br/>
    The CO Request field will be set to Y for Job Billing Item Change Requests.</p>
  <p><span style="font-weight: bold;">Contract Total:</span><br/>
    This value is zero for Change Requests and for unapproved Change Orders.</p>
  <h3>8.6.8 Job Main Tab</h3>
  <p><span style="font-weight: bold;">Main Tab New Display - Only Field - Client Site Info:</span><br/>
    These new fields list the Site&#39;s Name and Work/Ship Address.  A new v.cus file may be needed to see these fields.</p>
  <p style="font-weight: bold;">Changed Button: Clone Job<br/>
    <span style="font-weight: normal;">In this release, Change Orders and Change Requests will not be cloned.</span>
  </p>
  <p style="font-weight: normal;">See Customer Note 8.1.9 for a registry to default the cloned Job&#39;s Branch from the Site instead of the template Job.</p>
  <h3>8.6.8a Main Tab Job Cloning Buttons</h3>
  <p style="font-weight: bold;">Job Clone Button</p>
  <p><span style="font-size: 10.0pt; font-family: Arial, sans-serif; mso-fareast-font-family: &#39;Times New Roman&#39;; 
		 mso-fareast-theme-font: minor-fareast; mso-ansi-language: EN-US; 
		 mso-fareast-language: EN-US; mso-bidi-language: AR-SA;">In this release, Job Billing Items and Job Cost Codes flagged as &#39;Obsolete&#39; will also be cloned if the Job is a true template (with the Template field flagged).</span>  Obsolete Billing Items and Cost Code from Template Jobs will be cloned to support scenarios where users may wish to open up Billing Items and Cost Codes as a complex job progresses.  As in previous releases, Change Orders and Change Order Requests are not cloned.</p>
  <p style="font-weight: bold;">Edit Cost Code Button</p>
  <p>The list displayed when this button is clicked now excludes Job Cost Codes flagged as Obsolete.  To also display Obsolete records, click the Find Data button and clear the Obsolete range.</p>
  <p style="font-weight: bold;">Edit Billing Item Button</p>
  <p>The list displayed when this button is clicked now excludes Billing Items flagged as Obsolete.  To also display Obsolete records, click the Find Data button and clear the Obsolete range.</p>
  <h3>8.6.9 Job OpenWO -  New Tab</h3>
  <p>The OpenWO tab lists all work orders created for this Job that have a Work Order Status Category of Open. You may double-click on a line to open the corresponding Work Order.</p>
  <h3>8.6.10 Job OtherWO - New Tab</h3>
  <p>The OtherWO tab lists all work orders created for this Job that have a Work Order Status Category that is not set to Open (e.g., Completed, Billed, Ok to Invoice, etc.). You may double-click on a line to open the corresponding Work Order.</p>
  <h3>8.6.11 New Job Contract Type - Small Job</h3>
  <p style="margin-left: 8px;">Costs and Revenues are not recognized on a Small Job until the Job Date Closed is set.</p>
  <p style="margin-left: 48px;"><span style="font-weight: bold;">Modification to use Date Completed:</span><span> See Customer Note 8.1.9 for the Registry to Use the Job Date Completed instead of the Date Closed as a trigger in Job EOM for Small Jobs. </span></p>
  <p style="margin-left: 8px;">If the Job&#39;s Contract Type is set to Small Job, Start Job EOM will automatically use a special WIP method that will accrue revenue and costs until the Job Date Closed field is manually set by a user. If costs and or revenues are found for an open Small Job (Job Date Closed is blank) they will be debited/credited in the current accounting period and automatically reversed in the next accounting period.</p>
  <p style="margin-left: 8px;">If the job is closed in the current EOM period (Job Date Closed not blank) the Start Job EOM will attempt to recognize any unbilled revenue for this job (Contract amount from billing items), reversing this transaction in the 1st day of the next accounting period.  When the job is billed complete no further Job EOM process takes place.</p>
  <p style="margin-left: 48px;">Note: DB Underbilling  - CR Income<br style="margin-bottom: 0px; color: #000000; font-family: Verdana, &#39;Helvetica Neue&#39;, Helvetica, Arial, sans-serif;

  <p style="margin-left: 8px;">In the Job viewer, validation logic prevents a user from changing the Job Date Closed on Small Jobs if it is not blank and the Job EOM function has been executed for the job.</p>
  <h3>8.6.12 <span style="font-weight: bold;">Job Find Data Filter Screen</span></h3>
  <p style="margin-left: 8px;">A new range, PO#, has been added to allow the user to filter on the customer&#39;s PO# on the Job&#39;s Main tab. In addition, the PO# has been added as a column to the JobByClientIdByJobId list view.</p>
  <h2>8.7 Job Cost Code</h2>
  <h3>8.7.1 Main Tab</h3>
  <p><span style="font-weight: bold;">Changed Field - Billing Item Id:</span><br/>
    See Customer Note 8.1.4 for a Job Cost Code Registry to Warn User / Remove Job Progress Lines when the Billing Item is Changed (for use with custom Job Progress Analytics.</p>
  <p><span style="mso-list: l0 level1 lfo1;">C</span><span style="font-weight: bold;">IP Discount?</span><span style="mso-list: l0 level1 lfo1;"><br/>
      This release refines the handling of this field. If the CIP Discount box is flagged in the applicable Earnings record and in this Job Cost Code record, the CIP Discount Percent in the Job record will be applied to discounts the non-wage labor (burden) cost posted to this Job Cost Code.</span> In the original implementation, all N/A-type earnings were subject to CIP Discounting.  </p>
  <p>
    <font style="font-weight: bold;">New Field - Obsolete?</font><br/>
    If this field is checked, the record is considered Obsolete, and it may not be directly specified during data-entry (either by entering the Id or selecting it from a list). Obsoleted records can be edited and the Obsolete option can be cleared when necessary.
  </p>
  <p><span style="font-weight: bold;">New Field: Job Cost Category Usage Filter</span><br/>
    This field allows the user to filter which Cost Categories are eligible for selection when this Cost Code is entered in certain journals and records. When the user specifies this Cost Code in a detail line (i.e., for a Job Journal entry), the contents of this Usage Filter will automatically be added to the Cost Cat: range of the Job Cost Category filter preceded by sql=.  This special filtering  is in addition to any Job Cost Category filtering implemented for that specific journal or record.</p>

  <h2>8.8 Job History</h2>
  <p>The Unit Cost, Unit Price and Revenue Tab fields in Job History have been expanded to support values of up to 10 Million.</p>
  <h2>8.9 Job Cost Category</h2>
  <h3>8.9.1 List View</h3>
  <h5>New Indices:</h5>
  <p><span style="font-weight: bold;">JobCostCategorybyGLExpenseAccountById</span><br/>

  <h3><span style="font-weight: bold;">8.9.2 Job Cost Category Workers Comp Tab</span></h3>
  <p><span style="font-weight: bold;">New Field: Discipline Id</span><br/>
    This field supports multiple Worker&#39;s Comp Categories per Worker&#39;s Comp State. When Field time is entered, the system uses the entries on this tab to determine the correct WC Category using the state (from the Job record) and the Discipline (from the Job Cost Code record). It this field is NOT completed, only a single Worker&#39;s Comp Category per state is supported.</p>
  <p><span style="font-weight: bold;">Note:</span> the following registries must be implemented to apply this methodology to Office hours.</p>

    If this field is checked, the record is considered Obsolete, and it may not be directly specified during data-entry (either by entering the Id or selecting it from a list). Obsoleted records can be edited and the Obsolete option can be cleared when necessary.
  </p>
  <p style="font-weight: normal;">Updates:</p>
  <p style="font-weight: normal;">Since the Billing Item ID was updated to 15 characters, the display in SAMPro shows only 10 characters and it does not allow the user to click on the field to see the full details by navigating to the end of the field. This updates the layout in read-only fields and updates this value for the Record Billing Adjustment fields.</p>
  <h2>8.11 Project Manager Workbench</h2>
  <p>Previously when implementing the Project Manager WorkBench, the Process Project Manager routine was no longer performed, so a clean starting point was re-established. This update corrects this defect.</p>
  <p>This release corrects an error encountered when a Gen tab PO had a unit cost over 999,999.99. This caused the MatPO tab to not populate.  </p>
  <h3>8.11.1 Contract Items Tab</h3>
  <p style="font-weight: normal;">The right-click &#39;Quick Edit&#39; functionality has been disabled for GMP-type Jobs.  </p>
  <p style="font-weight: normal;"><span style="font-weight: bold;">PM%Earned -  PM$Earned - PM$NextInv - PMStatus</span><br/>
    These new columns display values submitted from the Web PMWB</p>
  <h3>8.11.1a Contract Items Tab Updates</h3>
  <p><span style="font-weight: bold;">Changed Column: Total Contract </span>(was labeled &quot;Contract Amount&quot;)<br/>
    This column includes the Original Value from Billing Items as well as approved Change Order values.</p>
  <p><span style="font-weight: bold;">Changed Column: Approved CO </span>(was labeled &quot;CO Amount&quot;)<br/>
    This Column lists Approved Change Order values. Note that the Date Approved may be in the future as long as it is set.</p>
  <p><span style="font-weight: bold;">New Column: Pending COR</span><br/>
    This column displays the value of an unapproved COR or CO. When the COR is approved and converted to a CO, it will display the approved value to the Approved CO column, and the pending value will be removed from the list.</p>
  <p>When a COR is attached to a CO, it will no longer appear in the Pending COP column; it is up to the user to revise the CO Amount of the CO it is attached to.</p>
  <p>Note that Billing Items and CO&#39;s do not have to have the Ok to Bill box flagged to have their values appear.  </p>
  <h3><span style="font-weight: bold;">8.11.2 Cost Codes Tab</span></h3>
  <p style="font-weight: normal;">The Cost Code Name has been added to this tab to the right of the Cost Code Id field.</p>
  <h3>8.11.3 Progress Tab</h3>
  <p style="font-weight: normal;">This release expands percentage columns to max out at 999999.9 on the Progress tab. This corrects the handling of lines having a %Used value exceeding 9999.9 so that the Totals display incorrectly.<span style="font-weight: bold;"> </span></p>
  <h3>8.11.4 Cost Sources Tab</h3>
  <p style="font-weight: normal;">The Purchase Order has been added as a column to the Cost Sources tab. If a Purchase Order is associated with a Cost Source in Job History it will be displayed in this column.</p>

  <h2>8.12 Job Billing Item Change Requests</h2>
  <h5>8.12.1 New Job Billing Item Change Requests Viewer</h5>
  <h5>Purpose:</h5>
  <p style="margin-left: 8px;">When changes to a Job are required but not yet approved, Change Requests (CORs) may be created for budgeting / reporting purposes prior to their approval. When a Change Request is approved, it may be converted to or attached to a Change Order for billing and costing;  budgets included on the Change Request will be added to the Job&#39;s Budget tab during this process.</p>
  <h5>Usage:</h5>
  <p>The Billing Item can have 3 different forms:</p>
  <p style="margin-left: 48px;">A standard Billing Item (typically created when Job was set up)<br/>
    A Change Order Billing Item that Changes a Original Job. (CO)<br/>
    A Change Request (COR)</p>
  <p style="margin-left: 8px;">Billing Items marked as Change Requests are used for budgeting, NOT for actual billing or  costing.  However, when a Change Request is approved, it may be:</p>
  <p style="margin-left: 48px;">Converted to a Change Order via the Convert To CO Button in the Job Billing Item Change Request viewer<br/>
    <span style="text-decoration: underline; ">Or</span><br/>
    Attached to an existing Job Billing Item Change Order via the Attach CO Requests button in the Job Billing Item Change Order viewer
  </p>
  <p style="margin-left: 8px;">Charge Request Amounts represent the values requested, not necessarily the values approved.  <span style="font-style: italic; 
															 font-weight: bold;">It is the user&#39;s responsibility to manually enter all appropriate values when converting or attaching to a Change Order!</span></p>
  <p style="margin-left: 8px;">Budgets entered on the Change Request&#39;s BudgetEntry tab will be used to generate corresponding entries to the Job&#39;s Budget tab when a Change Request is converted or attached to a Change Order.</p>
  <p>Open Change Requests (CORs) are included in Job EOM processing.  They are treated as Fixed Fee with the Contract Amount adjusted by Percent Likelihood. Change Requests will be processed by the EOM function if:</p>
  <p style="margin-left: 48px;">Date Approved &amp; Date Declined = 1900-01-01<br style="margin-bottom: 0px; color: #000000; font-family: Verdana, &#39;Helvetica Neue&#39;, Helvetica, Arial, sans-serif;

  <h5>Important Fields: Upper Section</h5>
  <p class="Tab">Main Tab</p>
  <p>
    <font style="font-weight: bold;">Bill Item Id:</font><br/>
    This required alphanumeric field must uniquely identify this Change Request for this Job.
  </p>
  <p>
    <font style="font-weight: bold;">Bill</font>
    <font style="font-weight: bold;">Item Description:</font><br/>
    Briefly describes this Change Request. Recommended but not required.
  </p>
  <p>
    <font style="font-weight: bold;">Job Id:</font><br/>
    The Job this Change Order Request is associated with.
  </p>
  <p>
    <font style="font-weight: bold;">CO Amount:  Expected Cost:</font><br/>
    In previous releases these fields were display only, and were maintained by the system based on the Change Request&#39;s Budget Tab. In this release, these fields may be manually updated if no Budget lines are present in the Change Request. If Budget lines are added, the Budget lines will overwrite the manually entered CO Amount and Expected Cost values on the Change Request&#39;s Main Tab.  Note that it is necessary to save the record and then refresh the display to see the changes.
  </p>
  <p><span style="font-weight: bold;">% Likelihood:</span><br/>
    How likely this Change Order Request is to be approved, entered as a percentage. This field controls how lines from the Budget Tab are written to Job History. If the Likelihood is changed as the Job progresses, the appropriate changes to the Job History budget will be generated.  </p>
  <p style="margin-left: 48px; text-decoration: underline; ">Example:</p>
  <p style="margin-left: 48px;">% Likelihood = 50   CO Amount: 1000   Expected Cost:550<br/>
    Budget lines written to Job History for this Change Order Request total a budgeted revenue of $500 and a budgeted cost of $275.</p>
  <p style="font-weight: bold;">CO Date Requested:<br/>
    <span style="font-weight: normal;">The date this Change Order Request was asked for.</span>
  </p>
  <p>
    <font style="font-weight: bold;">CO Date Approved:</font><br/>
    This display-only field will be competed by the system when this Change Request is converted to a Change Order or attached to a Change Order.
  </p>
  <p><span style="font-weight: bold;">CO Date Declined:</span><br/>
    This field should only be completed the customer declines this Change Order Request. When a Change Order Request is Declined, any Job History entries generated for this Request will be reversed when this record is saved.</p>
  <p><span style="font-weight: bold;">Change Request Description:</span><br/>
    This field will be used to generate the Change Order&#39;s Invoice Description if this Change Request is approved and converted to a Change Order.  </p>
  <p style="font-weight: bold;">Change Order:<br/>
    <span style="font-weight: normal;">This display field will be completed if this Change Request has been attached the displayed Change Order.</span>
  </p>
  <p><img alt="" border="0" src="assets/images/ConvertToCO.bmp" style="border: none;"/> When a Change Request is approved, clicking this button will convert it to a Change Order (CO) Billing Item. You will be asked to enter the Date Approved to be used on the Change Order and then click Yes to continue. When the Change Request has been converted, it will no longer be displayed in this viewer; it must be accessed via the Job Billing Item Change Order viewer.</p>
  <p>When a Change Order Request approves or attaches as a Fixed Fee Change Order, any accumulated T&amp;M revenue will receive offsetting postings. <span style="font-weight: bold;">Note that it is up to the user to specify an appropriate Contract Amount on the new/revised Fixed Fee Billing Item.</span>  </p>
  <p>Budgets entered on the Change Request&#39;s BudgetEntry tab will be used to generate corresponding entries to the Job&#39;s Budget tab at 100% likelihood. <span style="font-weight: bold;">Once the Change Request has been converted it is the user&#39;s responsibility to access it from the Job Billing Change Order viewer in order to complete any necessary fields, including the CO Amount and CO Cost, Invoicing Tab fields, etc.</span>  </p>
  <p style="margin-left: 48px;"><span style="font-weight: bold;">Alternative to Converting:</span> Instead of Converting a Change Request, it may be attached to an existing Change Order (using the Job Billing Change Order viewer&#39;s Attach CO Requests button). This allows multiple Change Requests to be combined on the same CO. Any accumulated T&amp;M revenue will receive offsetting postings. <span style="font-weight: bold;">Note that it is up to the user to specify an appropriate Contract Amount on the new/revised Fixed Fee Billing Item.</span>  </p>

    These optional fields may be used to record additional information required by your company or for reporting purposes.</p>
  <h5>Important Fields: Lower Section</h5>
  <p class="Tab">Budget Entry Tab</p>
  <p>Entries made in this tab will be written to Job History with a source journal of JBI Budget. Edits and changes to these lines will also be written to Job History. The Likelihood % field (see above)controls how lines from the Budget Tab are written to Job History. If the Likelihood is changed as the Job progresses, the appropriate changes to the Job History budget will be generated.  </p>
  <p style="margin-left: 48px;">
    <font style="font-weight: bold;">Editing Budget Entries:</font><br/>
    The BudgetEntry tab functions like the other SAMPro journals. If it is necessary to change a line, simply change it to the desired value and save the record.
  </p>
  <p>
    <font style="font-weight: bold;">Hours:</font>
    <font style="font-weight: bold;">Quantity:</font><br/>
    The Hours fields should be used to record labor budgets lines, and the Quantity field should be used to record material or other items. On a single line, fill in either the Hours or Quantity field.
  </p>
  <p>
    <font style="font-weight: bold;">Inventory Item:</font><br/>
    This option field would be used if you are budgeting for specific parts. Note that the cost / revenue for this part must be specified by the user; these values will not default from inventory history.
  </p>
  <p>
    <font style="font-weight: bold;">Cost Category:</font><br/>
    Enter (or import) an appropriate Job Cost Category for this line. For example, a Cost Category of type Labor should be selected for Hours entries.

  <p><span>This field supports enhanced filtering provided by the Cost Code&#39;s Job Cost Category Usage Filter. Cost Categories are validated relative to Cost Codes if this filtering is in place.</span></p>
  <p>
    <font style="font-weight: bold;">Job Cost Code:</font><br/>
    The Cost Code this budget is assigned to.
  </p>
  <p>
    <font style="font-weight: bold;">Unit Cost: Extended Cost:</font><br/>
    The Unit Cost must be entered by the user. The system will multiply the Hours or Quantity by the Unit Cost to calculate the Extended Cost. The Likelihood % field controls the cost which is written to Job History. If the Likelihood is changed as the Job progresses, the appropriate changes to the Job History budget will be generated.  
  </p>
  <p>
    <font style="font-weight: bold;">Billing Type: Revenue Rate: Extended Revenue:</font><br/>
    By default, the billing type is set to n/a so that the user can enter the Revenue directly. To have the system calculate the Extended Revenue for you, select a Billing Type and enter a Revenue Rate. The Likelihood % field controls this revenue which is written to Job History. If the Likelihood is changed as the Job progresses, the appropriate changes to the Job History budget will be generated.

  <p style="margin-left: 8px"><span style="font-weight:bold;">Job Billing Item CO/Request Viewers: </span><br/>
    In version 9.1.611.059 and up, the &quot;required field&quot; registries are now reading correctly, and users are no longer able to save or add without adding a field specified as required by the registry. Previously for required fields for Job Billing Change Orders and Requests, users were able to bypass the required fields and save.</p>
  <h3 class="Support">8.12.3 Registry Report Change Order Request - Override Bitmaps by Fields in Site or Job</h3>
  <p>The revised version of Report Change Order Request (RCHNGEORDRRQST.rpt) dated 2021-03-12 supports several bitmap overrides based on fields in the Job or Site. The bitmap registry option will be used to specify the bitmap if an override is not found.</p>
  <p><span style="font-weight: bold;">Id:</span> sys-report-rchngeordrrqst</p>
  <h5>Override Based on the COR&#39;s Job / Site</h5>

  <p>The first option turns on the override behavior; the Job&#39;s Branch will be used to specify the bitmap. The second option specifies the bitmap that will be used with a particular branch.  If the Job record&#39;s Branch is not completed, the Site&#39;s Branch will be used to determine the override.</p>
  <h5>Override Based on the COR&#39;s Job</h5>
  <p><span style="font-weight: bold;">Setting Key:</span> BitmapOverrideBasedOn    <span style="font-weight: bold;">Setting Value:</span> job</p>

  <h5>Overrides Based on the COR&#39;s Client Site</h5>
  <p><span style="font-weight: bold;">Setting Key:</span> BitmapOverrideBasedOn    <span style="font-weight: bold;">Setting Value:</span> <span style="font-style: italic;">FieldInClientSite</span></p>
  <p>This option turns on the override behavior, and defines which record in the Client Site will be used to define the bitmap override. Valid values are:</p>
  <p style="margin-left: 48px;">accountmanager<br/>
    servicemanager<br/>
    dispatcher</p>
  <p><span style="font-weight: bold;">Setting Key:</span> <span style="font-style: italic;">FieldInClientSite~RecordId</span>  <font style="font-weight: bold;">Setting Value:</font> <span style="font-style: italic;">sharepath\bitmap.bmp</span></p>
  <p>This entry defines matches the override with the bitmap.  One entry needs to be created for each override bitmap. The Setting Key defines the field and individual record Id; the Setting Value defines the bitmap.  </p>
  <p style="margin-left: 48px;"><span style="text-decoration: underline; ">Example:  Use the Client Site&#39;s Account Manager to Specify the Override</span></p>
  <p style="margin-left: 48px;">In this example, assume that Jean,Tim, Joe and Sarah are account managers. Jean and Tim need special overrides; Joe and Sarah do not.</p>
  <p style="margin-left: 48px;">Id: sys-report-rchngeordrrqst</p>
  <p style="margin-left: 48px;">Setting Key: BitmapOverrideBasedOn    Setting Value: accountmanager</p>
  <p style="margin-left: 48px;">Turns on the override.</p>

  <p style="margin-left: 48px;">Setting Key: bitmap    Setting Value: <span style="font-style: italic;">sharepath/</span>Company_invoice.bmp</p>
  <p style="margin-left: 48px;">Provides the default bitmap for Account Managers Joe and Sarah, and for COR&#39;s generated for Client Sites without an Account Manager specified.</p>
  <h2>8.13 Job Billing Item Change Order</h2>
  <p><span style="font-weight: bold;">Changed Field: CO Amount</span><br/>

  <p><span style="font-weight: bold;">Expected Cost:</span><span><br/>
      If this CO was created from a Change Request, this field will be generated from the Change Request&#39;s Budgeted Costs. If Change Requests were attached to this Change Order, this field should be manually updated to include the budgeted cost on the attached Change Requests.</span></p>
  <h3>8.13.1 Job Billing Item Change Order - New Attach CO Request Button</h3>
  <p><img alt="" border="0" src="assets/images/AttachCORs.bmp" style="border: none;"/>  When this new button is clicked,  the system will determine if any Change Requests are eligible for attachment to this Change Order. If any are found, a checklist will be displayed, allowing the user to select which ones to attach. Budgets entered on the Change Request&#39;s BudgetEntry tab will be used to generate corresponding entries to the Job&#39;s Budget tab at 100% likelihood. Any accumulated T&amp;M Revenue will generate offsetting postings in the current accounting period if it is converted to Fixed Fee.  <span style="font-style: italic; font-weight: bold;">It is the user&#39;s responsibility to manually enter update all appropriate values in the Change Order including the CO Amount and CO Cost when attaching to a Change Order!  </span></p>

  <h3>8.13.4 Registry to Set Change Order Invoice Report Fields on Converting COR to CO</h3>
  <p style="font-weight: bold;"><span style="font-weight: normal;">When Job Billing Item Change Request (COR) is converted to a Change Order (CO), the Report Id and Report Query Id on the COR default to the CO.  If the user neglects to complete these important fields, they will be blank on the CO.</span></p>
  <p style="font-weight: normal;">If enabled, the following registry specifies the invoice Report Id and Report Query that will be written to the CO when the COR is converted if these fields are NOT completed in the COR.

  <h2>8.15 Job Cost EOM Processing</h2>
  <p>Previously, the Jobcost End Of Month postings in JC History were preventing the release of qualifying Accounts Payable invoices for the  Start Pay-When-Paid Approved List function. To allow eligible AP invoices to qualify for release using the Start PWP Approved List function, this update includes a string to ignore/exclude those postings in JCH derived from source ‘Jobcost EOM’.</p>
  <p>In version 9.1.611.060b, this update improves security and performance for Job End of Month processing.</p>
  <p>In version 9.1.611.059, this release fixes the Job End of Month Processing function to limit the validation logic that ensures there are no running Invoices to the same criteria as the Job End of Month Processing function so that unrelated running Invoices do not block the EOM function.</p>
  <p>In version 9.1.611.058, the user is notified if anyone is invoicing work order or jobs when Job End of Month has started:</p>
  <p style="margin-left: 48px;">Invoices or Worksheets are currently being processed by another user. Cannot perform Job EOM processing.</p>
  <p>This is a change from Version 9.1.611.052, where Job History with #userid in the jchstry_rfrnce_ar_invce_id were allowed to QUALIFY for inclusion in Job EOM adjustment details. This change caused a discrepancy in numerous WIP reports, and also did not address the issue that users should NOT be invoicing when Start Job End of Month is running.</p>
  <p style="margin-left: 8px;">In version 9.1.611.058, a workspace message screen will then display the active invoicing details so that these other users can be alerted to complete their invoicing. The Job, Work Order, and User&#39;s Name are listed. If no actual User is on file, it will print out what was in the field. This message will supply the user with everything they or support needs to know to find &amp; clear the associated jchstry_rfrnce_ar_invce_id transactions if the # user info isn&#39;t valid.</p>
  <p style="margin-left: 48px;">The following Work Orders/Jobs are currently being Invoiced.<br/>
    Each has one or more JCH entries that are being locked by a user:</p>
  <p style="margin-left: 48px;">Job:   WO:   User:</p>
  <p style="margin-left: 8px;">Once the Jobs and Work Orders are no longer being processed for invoicing, Job End of Month can be run. Note that #userid may be retained in the jchstry_rfrnce_ar_invce_id if a user exits while in the process of running Compute Service Billing.</p>
  <p>Version 9.1.611.056 supports changes in precision of decimals to match DBAnalytics. This change supports the broader objective to make % Completion Revenue audit-able and consistent with DBA: Job Performance.</p>
  <p>This release includes &#39;open&#39; Job Billing Item Change Requests (CORs) in the processing.  They are treated as Fixed Fee with the Contract Amount adjusted by Percent Likelihood. Change Requests will be processed by the EOM function if:</p>
  <p style="margin-left: 48px;">Date Approved &amp; Date Declined = 1900-01-01<br style="margin-bottom: 0px; color: #000000; font-family: Verdana, &#39;Helvetica Neue&#39;, Helvetica, Arial, sans-serif;

  <h2>8.16 Enhanced Prevailing Wage Processing</h2>
  <p style="margin-left: 48px;"><span style="font-weight: bold;">Important:</span> A new v.cus file will be required to see this enhancement; standard customizations are included with this release. Company-specific customization may be requested from your Support representative. Note that View Prevailing Wage Schedule must be enabled for the User Groups that should have access to it.</p>
  <h3>8.16.1 New Viewer: Prevailing Wage Schedule</h3>
  <h3>Purpose:</h3>
  <p>The Prevailing Wage Schedule (P.W. Schedule record) may be used instead of the Job&#39;s Prevailing Wage tab to define a Job&#39;s Prevailing Wage structure. In this way, when a particular Prevailing Wage Schedule changes, it is only necessary to change it this new record, instead of changing the Prevailing Wage Tab in each Job record that it impacts.</p>
  <h3>Usage:</h3>
  <p>This feature is ONLY supported if the following registry is enabled:</p>
  <p style="margin-left: 48px;">Id: sys-ffv-global-settings</p>
  <p style="margin-left: 48px;">Setting Key:  LaborRatesAndAccrualMethod   Setting Value: 7687</p>
  <p style="margin-left: 8px;">If a P.W. Schedule Id is specified on the Job&#39;s Main or Financial Tab, the Prevailing Wage Type must be set to Labor Rate for the prevailing wage functionality to be enabled.</p>
  <p style="margin-left: 8px;">If both the P.W. Schedule Id field and the Prevailing Wages Tab are completed on a Job, the P.W. Schedule will have precedence.</p>
  <h5>Important Fields: Upper Section</h5>
  <p style="margin-left: 8px;">
    <font style="font-weight: bold;">P.W. Schedule Id:</font><br/>
    A unique Id for this table. This field is required.
  </p>
  <p style="margin-left: 8px;">
    <font style="font-weight: bold;">P.W. Schedule Name:</font><br/>
    A brief description of this table. This field is optional.
  </p>
  <p style="margin-left: 8px;">
    <font style="font-weight: bold;">P.W. Schedule User 1-2:</font><br/>
    These fields may be used for informational and reporting purposes
  </p>
  <p style="margin-left: 8px;">
    <font style="font-weight: bold;">Obsolete?</font><br/>
    If this field is checked, the record is considered Obsolete, and it may not be directly specified during data-entry (either by entering the Id or selecting it from a list). Obsoleted records can be edited and the Obsolete option cleared when necessary.
  </p>
  <h5>Important Fields: Lower Section</h5>
  <h5>Wages Tab</h5>
  <p style="margin-left: 8px;">
    <font style="font-weight: bold;"><span style="font-weight: bold;">S</span>tart: Date:</font><br/>
    These fields default the effective (work) date range the prevailing wage is in effect for.
  </p>
  <p style="margin-left: 8px;">
    <font style="font-weight: bold;">Labor Rate Id:</font><br/>
    All Labor Rates that would be impacted by this job’s prevailing wage functionality should be listed on this tab.
  </p>
  <p style="margin-left: 8px;">
    <font style="font-weight: bold;">Overtime / Doubletime Pay Rates:</font><br/>
    The Pay rate multiplier DOES NOT affect the Prevailing Wage Package Amount. Regular, overtime and any other pays must be all accommodated for each Labor Rate specified.
  </p>
  <p style="margin-left: 8px;">
    <font style="font-weight: bold;">Base Rate:</font><br/>
    This field should be used to enter the base wage rate for this Prevailing Wage. The system will sum the Fringe Rate and the Base Rate when determining whether to use the Prevailing Wage during Compute Payroll.
  </p>
  <p style="margin-left: 48px; text-decoration: underline; ">Standard Calculation:</p>
  <p style="margin-left: 48px;">
    <font style="text-decoration: underline; ">Example 1: Employee’s Regular Wages + Fringes Exceed P.W. Base + Fringes</font>
    <font style="text-decoration: underline; ">Amount</font>
  </p>
  <p style="margin-left: 48px;">Base Rate: $25.00 / hour<br/>
    Fringe Rate: $0.00<br/>
    Wage Earnings: $24.00 / hour<br/>
    Fringe 1: $2.50 / hour<br/>
    Fringe 2: $1.50 / hour</p>
  <p style="margin-left: 48px;">Since the Employee’s regular Wages + Fringes total $28.00 / hours (greater than the prevailing wage Base + Fringe of $25.00/ hour), they will be used for payroll calculations for this Prevailing Wage job.</p>
  <p style="margin-left: 48px;">
    <font style="text-decoration: underline; ">Standard Calculation</font><br/>
    <font style="text-decoration: underline; ">Example 2: Job Base Rate + Fringes</font>
    <font style="text-decoration: underline; ">Amount Exceeds Employee’s Regular Wages + Fringes</font>
  </p>
  <p style="margin-left: 48px;">Base Rate: $40.00 / hour<br/>
    Fringe Rage: $5.00 / hour<br/>
    Wage Earnings: $27.00 / hour<br/>
    Fringe: $1.00 / hour</p>
  <p style="margin-left: 8px;">Since the Employee’s regular Wages + Fringes total $28.00 / hours, the Prevailing Wage methodology will come into effect since the Base Rate + Fringe Rate = 45.00 / hour. The system calculates the Employee’s Wages as follows:</p>
  <p style="margin-left: 8px;">Wage Earnings Calculated Under Prevailing Wage: $44.00 / hour<br/>
    Fringe: $1.00 / hour</p>
  <p style="margin-left: 8px;">Note that the Employee’s Wages + Fringes package now equals $45 / hour, the Prevailing Wage Job Package rate. The increased difference is added to the Employee wage.</p>
  <p style="margin-left: 8px;">
    <font style="font-weight: bold;">Fringe Rate:</font><br/>
    This field enables you to separate Fringes from the Base Rate for prevailing wages. The system will sum the Fringe Rate and the Base Rate when determining whether to use the Prevailing Wage during Compute Payroll.
  </p>
  <p style="margin-left: 48px;">
    <font style="font-weight: bold;">Note: Excluding Fringes from Workers Compensation</font><br/>
    Workers comp &#39;wages&#39; typically should not include any amounts related to prevailing wage fringes. The Exclude Fringes field in the appropriate Workers Comp State should be flagged to exclude these fringes from workers compensation calculation.
  </p>
  <p style="margin-left: 8px;">
    <font style="font-weight: bold;">Certified PR Report Label:</font><br/>
    The Certified Payroll report has been enhanced so that it uses this field (if completed) instead of the Labor Rate Description. If this field is blank, the Labor Rate Description will be used.
  </p>
  <h3>8.16.2  Job Viewer - Main and Financial Tabs</h3>
  <p style="font-weight: bold;">New Field:</p>
  <p><span style="font-weight: bold;">P.W. Schedule Id:</span><br/>
    If this field is completed AND the Prevailing Wage Type field is set to Labor Rate, the P.W. Schedule will be used for prevailing wage calculations. When completed, this field overrides any entries on the Job&#39;s Prevailing Wages Tab.</p>
  <p style="margin-left: 48px;"><span style="font-weight: bold;">IMPORTANT:</span> The sys-ffv-global-settings option LaborRatesAndAccrualMethod  must be set to 7687 to support this functionality.</p>
  <h2>8.17  Revenue Recalculations:  Change Order Request And Billing Items</h2>
  <p>Although a Change Order Request cannot be billed, it can be used to accumulate costs and revenue that may ultimately be billed as T&amp;M revenue, or as a Fixed Fee Change Order.  When a Change Order Request approves or attaches as a Fixed Fee Change Order, any accumulated T&amp;M revenue will receive offsetting postings in the current period if it was converted to Fixed Fee. Note that it is up to the user to specify an appropriate Contract Amount on the new/revised Fixed Fee Billing Item.  This change has been implemented for both methods of approving a COR:</p>
  <p>JobBillingItemChangeRequest Viewer&#39;s &quot;Convert to CO&quot; button<br/>
    JobBillingItemChangeOrder&#39;s &quot;attach CO Requests&quot; into the existing CO</p>
  <p>The same Revenue Recalculations will occur for a formerly T&amp;M Billing Item that gets edited (transformed) into a Fixed Fee Billing item; any accumulated T&amp;M revenue will receive offsetting postings. </p>
  <h2>8.18 Job Cloning</h2>
  <p>Previously when attempting to clone from a Job Template using an active client or site, it displayed a warning that the status is &quot;blank&quot; when the sites are active. This only occurred in version 9.1.611.062 if the ID for the site or client was NOT numeric. In 9.1.611.062a and up, this update corrects this defect.</p>
  <p>In 9.1.611.062 and up, when cloning a Job to be linked to an inactive client or site, a warning box now alerts users about the inactive client or site. The warning box says “The {Client/ Site} you have selected has a status of {inactive, credit hold, mail list}. Do you want to continue with the Job cloning process?&quot; with a Yes and No button, allowing the user to continue or back out of the clone.</p>
  <p>In version 9.1.611.059 and up, users are alerted if they did not save. After the prompt, if they hit yes, required fields validation sets in. Then the required fields are necessary to complete before saving again.</p>
  <h2>8.19 Sales Tax Group Viewer</h2>
  <p>This update adds the Tax Rate to the Sales Tax Group Viewer. This includes the sort by, Field To Add, and between &quot;Name&quot; and &quot;state&quot;.</p>
  <h2>8.20 Job Cost Allocations</h2>
  <p>Previously the Job Cost Allocation function was not properly joining the job cost history to security. This caused any summed totals to be incorrect for any customer using security, due to reading the values multiple times. This update joins records from job cost history to security using their security RNs. In addition to removing the duplicated values in the calculations, this will also ensure that the data is filtered to the user&#39;s security.</p>
  <h1>9 Invoicing</h1>

  <h3>9.1.3a Service Billing Registry to Clear Billing Agent User Id</h3>
  <p>This release supports registry entries to clear the default initial values when running Compute Service Invoice. This allows the Billing Agent User Id range to be automatically cleared when running this function. Previously, the User Id of the user running the function would always be written to the Billing Agent User Id range when Compute Service Invoice was run.</p>
  <p><span style="font-weight: bold;">Registry Id:</span> sys-start-ssrvcebllngcmpte</p>

  </p>
  <h3>9.1.4 Record Billing Adjustments - Restart Function After Save</h3>
  <p>The following registry automatically restarts Record Billing Adjustments when a record is saved.</p>
  <p><span style="font-weight: bold;">Id:</span> sys-viewer-srcrdbllngadjstmt</p>
  <p><span style="font-weight: bold;">Setting Key</span>: ReopenViewerWhenRecordWritten   <span style="font-weight: bold;"> Setting Value:</span> true   (default is false)</p>
  <p style="font-weight: normal;">If this option is enabled, clicking the red X on the Job Id input screen closes Record Billing Adjustments so that is does not reopen.</p>
  <h3>9.1.4a Deny Selection of Ready to Post in Record Billing Adjustments</h3>
  <p style="font-weight: normal;">When enabled, this registry denies selection of &#39;Ready to Post&#39; in Record Billing Adjustments (the Job Invoice Viewer). This registry is strongly recommended to prevent users from posting an invoice without having produced a printed copy. It should always be implemented if autosave or autosavewhenprinted is enabled.<br style="color: #000000;

  <h3>9.1.5 Registry for RDF</h3>
  <p>Effective July 1st, 2022, Colorado is instituting a new Retail Delivery Fee (RDF) of $0.27 for all Colorado deliveries involving a motor vehicle component and where at least one item in the delivery is subject to state sales or use tax. This update allows Colorado users to edit their data to create a new job cost category and to correspond other rate ID to add this RDF to an invoice.</p>

  <p><strong>WARNING: User must include a non-zero Billable Quantity when entering the special Retail Delivery Fee line.</strong></p>
  <h2>9.2 Reports</h2>
  <h3>9.2.1 Service Invoice</h3>
  <p>Previously when invoicing a job for the first time (where sales tax group ID is truly blank) SAMPro called out to Avalara and wrote back an appropriate tax group and invoices. However, those initial invoices would not display on the Sales Tax Summary by State by Group Report (<strong>RSLSTXSMMRY-TXHSTRY</strong>). This update corrects this defect and the report displays the invoices.</p>
  <p>Previously, using the <strong>SERVICEINVOICE</strong> report would result in the Reference number provided from Electronic Payments overlaying the masked Credit Card number. In 9.1.611.061, this update corrects this defect. </p>
  <p>In 9.1.611.060, this update adds a Client Site Id for an input option when running Service Invoices. Also, the Document Viewer now includes a Log tab that shows Document Log table references to the Document in the viewer.  This simplifies matching up the Log info to the appropriate Document parent record.</p>
  <p>Previously when a user would send an email where the recipient’s email address contained an apostrophe, it would trigger an error even if it was the correct email address. This update corrects that defect.</p>
  <p>In 9.1.611.059a, this update corrects Job History entries that have UserRn values did not clear if they subsequently fail to qualify for the select/deselect ToInvoice list.</p>
  <p>This release corrects sporadic &#39;key is missing&#39; errors invoicing COD WOs. Potentially OOB Cash Receipts / AR Sales entries appear on the Checklist but cannot be flagged for processing.</p>
  <p>The report revised 2016-04-05 adds the PO Id to AR Summary section.</p>
  <p>Previously, if Show Equipment Detail was flagged, only the first 1200 characters of the Equipment Work Requested and Performed were printed. The revised Service Invoice (SERVICEINVOICEv90_b002.rpt revised 2015-12-19) prints the entire 3000 character contents of these fields if applicable.</p>
  <p>The revised Service Invoice (SERVICEINVOICEv90_b002.rpt revised 2015-11-02) supports the new &quot;Equipment Work Performed Addendum - Show on Invoices&quot; box on the Work Order.  If this box is flagged, the invoice will continue to print the Invoice Description of Work Performed. However, a page break AFTER the Invoice Total/AR Summary will occur and additional (addendum) page(s) will print as necessary to present the COMPLETE – Work Performed text associated to EACH WO Equipment record on the work order. See Customer Note 16.3.3 for additional details.</p>
  <h3>9.2.1a Service Invoice - Enhancement to Attach TechAnywhere Receipts and Other Documents to Emailed Invoices and to Skip Print Emailed Invoices</h3>
  <p>This release adds the ability to append TechAnywhere receipts or other documents to the PDF&#39;d version of Service Invoices. This allows an Invoice Package to be automatically emailed to customers configured to receive Service Invoices via email. Supported document attachment file types include: .bmp, .jpg, .gif, .png,  and .pdf. This functionality is suitable for scenarios where a Work Order is only invoiced once.</p>
  <p style="margin-left: 48px;"><span style="font-weight: bold;">Important:  Only the PDF&#39;d Invoice Includes the Attachments</span><br/>
    The .dbr version of the Service Invoice will not display the attached documents; it will however include a list of attached files. Only the PDF&#39;d version of this document will include the &#39;package&#39; of document attachments.</p>
  <p>To enable this functionality:</p>
  <p>1. The revised Service Invoice serviceinvoicev90b028.rpt dated 2016/02/16 or later must be installed in your database.</p>
  <p>2. The Client Site Email Invoices field (a-clntste: clntste.eml-invce) must contain a list of the Document Categories which should be included in the Invoice Package. The included documents must be attached to the Work Order being invoiced prior to the generation of the invoice. Any documents attached to the Work Order after an invoice is generated will not be included in this package.</p>
  <p>For example, to include TechAnywhere Receipts in the Invoice Package for a particular Site, you would enter <span style="font-weight: bold;">Receipt</span> in its Email Invoices field.</p>
  <p>3. Verify that the xmlToPdf.jar file (located in the same directory as your SAMPro executable) is dated 2015/07/08 or later.</p>
  <p>4. Implement the following registry entries:</p>
  <p><span style="font-weight: bold;">Id:</span> sys-start-ssrvcebllngcmpte:</p>
  <p><span style="font-weight: bold;">Setting Key:</span> IncludeInvoiceDocuments   <span style="font-weight: bold;">Setting Value:</span> true    (default false)</p>
  <p>This option is required to implement the new &#39;package&#39; functionality.</p>
  <p><span style="font-weight: bold;">Setting Key:</span> SkipPrintEmailedInvoices   <span style="font-weight: bold;">Setting Value:</span> true</p>
  <p>Implementing this registry allows emailed invoices to be &#39;skipped&#39; in the print run.  Processing will proceed as usual: the Invoices will be displayed and sent to the printer; the user must then confirm that the invoices have printed and post them. However, only those invoices that were not emailed will actually be printed.</p>
  <p><span style="font-weight: bold;">Id:</span> sys-report-serviceinvoice:</p>
  <p><span style="font-weight: bold;">Setting Key:</span> sectionbackerbitmap   <span style="font-weight: bold;">Setting Value:</span> <span style="font-style: italic;">Pathname</span>\whitesquare.bmp</p>
  <p>This registry is recommended to prevent the invoice bitmap from &#39;stepping on&#39; the attached documents. The bitmap may be obtained from support.</p>
  <p><span style="font-weight: bold;">Setting Key:</span> ShowDocumentDescription  <span style="font-weight: bold;">Setting Value:</span> Y</p>
  <p>This option should be enabled to display the Document Description of the attached graphic document on the upper left-hand corner of the page. Note that the attachments themselves (along with the Description) are only shown when the invoice is PDF&#39;d.</p>

  <h3>9.2.1g Service Invoice Expanded Work Order Equipment Work Performed/Requested</h3>
  <p style="margin-left: 8px;">The revised Service Invoice dated 2018-04-06 (SERVICEINVOICEv90b028) has the Work Order Equipment Work Perform and Work Order Equipment Work Requested fields expanded to 6000 characters as this field size was increased in the 9.1 image. This change should correct the &quot;Unable to insert into Temp Table #woequipment&quot; SQL error experienced when invoicing work orders with lengthy Work Order Equipment Work Performed or Requested.  </p>
  <h3>9.2.1h Specify Service Invoice Bitmap Override by Job</h3>
  <p>The revised Service Invoice (SERVICEINVOICEv90b028.rpt) dated 2018-05-14 supports the new bitmap override by Job functionality.</p>
  <p><span style="font-weight: bold;">Registry Id:</span> sys-report-serviceinvoice</p>
  <p><span style="font-weight: bold;">Setting Key:</span>  BitmapOverrideBasedOn   <span style="font-weight: bold;">Setting Value:</span> job</p>
  <p>This registry entry defines that this override is based on a user field in the invoice&#39;s Job record.</p>
  <p><span style="font-weight: bold;">Setting Key:</span> BitmapOverrideField  <span style="font-weight: bold;">Setting Value:</span> <span style="font-style: italic;">job user database field</span></p>
  <p>This registry entry specifies exactly Job User field will provide the override; the database field name must be specified. For example, the following specifies the Job&#39;s User 3 field:</p>
  <p style="margin-left: 48px;">Setting Key: BitmapOverrideField  Setting Value: jb_usr3</p>
  <p style="margin-left: 8px;"><span style="font-weight: bold;">Setting Key:</span> Job~<span style="font-style: italic;">string</span>   <span style="font-weight: bold;">Setting Value:</span> <span style="font-style: italic;">path\bitmap.</span>bmp</p>
  <p style="margin-left: 8px;">This entry provide the override bitmap file that will be used if the Job record&#39;s User field defined above contains the string specified.  Notice that a tilde (~) separates Job from the string. As many of these entries may be made as needed to support the various bitmaps.</p>
  <p style="margin-left: 48px;">Example:</p>
  <p style="margin-left: 48px;">Suppose that we have a bitmap file named 010101_invoice.bmp that should be used on invoices associated with Job&#39;s having the following text string 010101 in Job User 3 fields.</p>
  <p style="margin-left: 48px;">Setting Key: Job~010101  Setting Value: <span style="font-style: italic;">path\</span>010101_invoice.bmp</p>
  <p style="margin-left: 8px;"><span style="font-weight: bold;">Tip:</span> Include the part of the bitmap name as the text string for clarity.</p>
  <p style="margin-left: 8px;"><span style="font-weight: bold;">Tip: </span>Including the appropriate values in your job templates will ensure that new jobs are created properly. In addition, using the Custom Fields functionality to specify the allowed values will prevent inappropriate values from being entered.</p>
  <h3>9.2.i Service Invoice With Registry to Print Amount Due in Red at Top of First Page</h3>
  <p>The revised Service Invoice report (SERVICEINVOICEv90b028.rpt) dated 2019-02-15 supports the correct handling of the Amount Due field (enabled via the following registry) when a payment had been applied to the invoice. The following registry setting prints the Amount Due of the invoice on the top of the first page, below the Service Location on the right-hand side of the page. It is printed in bold, red text to stand out. This functionality is supported for the STANDARD and CANADA headers; custom report headers can be updated as needed for a small fee.  </p>
  <p>The following registry is required to enable this functionality.</p>
  <p><span style="font-weight: bold;">Id</span>: sys-report-serviceinvoice</p>
  <p><span style="font-weight: bold;">Setting Key:</span> ShowAmountDuePage1  <span style="font-weight: bold;">Setting Value:</span> true</p>
  <h3>9.2.1j Apply Performance Enhancements to the Service Invoice</h3>
  <p><span style="font-weight: bold;">Id:</span> sys-report-serviceinvoice</p>
  <p><span style="font-weight: bold;">Setting Key:</span> ReportExtended   <span style="font-weight: bold;">Setting Value:</span> true   (default false)</p>
  <p>This will enable the functionality for the Service Invoice (assuming that the sys-behavior-reports registry is not enabled or set to false). The enhancement will appear when the report is being displayed. See Customer Release Note for a registry to apply this registry to all user-defined reports.</p>
  <h3>9.2.1k Revised Service Invoice Prevents Out of Balance AR Sales Journals</h3>
  <p>Report Service Invoice (SERVICEINVOICEv91b054.rpt) dated 2020-08-21 or later</p>
  <p>Report Service Invoice Post (SERVICEINVOICEPOSTv91b054.rpt) dated 2020-07-10 or later</p>
  <p>The above revised reports require SAMPro Version 9.1.611.054 or above. This release (along with the revised reports) will prevent OOB AR Sales Journal transactions, which exhibit signs that indicate that unbilled details are omitted in between the Invoice Checklist and Invoice generation; resulting in an ARSJ with Total Amount, but no detail lines.  When the revised reports are run in this image:</p>
  <p style="margin-left: 48px;">Service Invoice Checklist builds a temp table of qualifying rows to invoice based on JCH</p>
  <p style="margin-left: 48px;">Add/include new column count(unbilledjchrow) to temp table for each qualified row</p>
  <p style="margin-left: 48px;">The updated Service Invoice report includes a test to confirm that invoices being generated finds the same number of unbilled JCH rows as designated in temp table - if it doesn&#39;t it skips production/post of that invoice.</p>
  <p style="margin-left: 48px;">Reporting of *skipped* invoices has been added to the Service Invoice Post report that is optionally executed at the conclusion of invoice process.<span style="font-weight: bold;"> </span></p>
  <h3><span style="font-weight: bold;">9.2.1L S</span>ervice Invoicing - Invoice Backer / Terms and Conditions Page</h3>
  <p>In previous release a customized variant of the &#39;sectionbackerbitmap&#39; was enabled to allow service invoices to include attached documents when pdf&#39;d and emailed. Unfortunately, this prevents the standard &#39;sectionbackerbitmap&#39; functionality from working in the report.  This release supports the addition of an invoice backer (typically for Terms and Conditions). The backer will appear at the end of the pdf&#39;d invoice package.</p>
  <p>Note that the sectionbackerbitmap registry must be included in the sys-report-serviceinvoice registry (ies) to ensure that the header bitmap does not step on the new backer and other invoice package documents.</p>
  <p>1. Create a invoice backer file that can be pdf&#39;d by SAMPro.  The following file types may be used for the backer:  .bmp, .jpg, .gif, .png, and .pdf.</p>
  <p>2. Go to the sys-start-ssrvcebllngcmpte registry.</p>
  <p>3. Attach the backer file to the Registry and set the Document Category to InvoiceBacker. Save the Document file. Note that the backer file should only be attached to a single registry record.</p>
  <p>4. Add the registry option:</p>
  <p><span style="font-weight: bold;">Registry Id: </span>sys-start-ssrvcebllngcmpte</p>
  <p><span style="font-weight: bold;">Setting Key:</span> AutoIncludeDocs  <span style="font-weight: bold;">Setting Value:</span> comma separated list of strings for document categories</p>
  <p>In our example, the Setting Value would be set to InvoiceBacker.</p>
  <p><span style="font-weight: bold;">Setting Key:</span> IncludeInvoiceDocuments   <span style="font-weight: bold;">Setting Value:</span> true</p>
  <p>This existing option is also required to implement the &#39;invoice package&#39;.</p>
  <p>5. When the PDF&#39;d service invoice is generated, the backer will appear at the end of the invoice package, after any documents include via the IncludeInvoiceDocuments option (these document categories are noted in the Site&#39;s Email Invoice field).  </p>
  <p style="font-weight: bold;">Important Implementation Notes:</p>
  <p style="font-weight: bold;"><span style="font-weight: normal;">If Custom Fields has been used to specify allowed Categories, you may need to add InvoiceBacker on a  temporary basis, and remove it after the document has been created.</span> If other documents are inadvertently added with this category they will also be included in the Service Invoice package!</p>
  <p>There are 2 scenarios to include documents for the new logic:</p>
  <p style="margin-left: 48px;">If the document has the category in the registry and the document has References and NONE of those References include the Work Order being invoiced, it will be included</p>
  <p style="margin-left: 48px;">If the document has the category in the registry and the document has NO References.</p>
  <p style="margin-left: 48px;">Strictly speaking, the Document record does not need to be attached to ANY record, but if this is the case the Document Record and ONLY be accessed by entering the Document Id in the Document viewer. Since this makes it too easy to &#39;lose&#39; the file, we are recommending attaching it to the registry record, with a new document category.</p>
  <h3>9.2.1m Revised Service Invoice Corrects Temp Table Error</h3>
  <p>Report Service Invoice: SERVICEINVOICEv91b054.rpt</p>
  <p>Report Service Invoice: SERVICEINVOICEv90b028.rpt</p>
  <p>The revised reports dated 2021-04-06 will correct the &quot;Unable to insert into Temp Table #woequipment&quot; SQL error experienced when invoicing or running the billing worksheet for work orders with lengthy Work Order Equipment Work Performed or Requested fields. The contents of these fields will now be truncated if the WO Equipment Work Performed exceeds 6000 charters or the WO Equipment Work Requested exceeds 4000 characters so that the error will be avoided.</p>
  <h3>9.2.1n New <span style="font-weight: bold;">Service Invoice Format</span></h3>
  <p>In version 9.1.611.060 and up, this report provides a new format for the service invoice reports. This format matches the existing FORMAT_11, with the following alterations:<br/>
    •    Replace the label &quot;Work Order Id&quot; with &quot;Conserv Ref No:&quot;<br/>
    •    Replace the label &quot;P.O. #&quot;  with &quot;CK Work Order:&quot;<br/>
    •    Replace the &quot;@&quot; signs on all line items with &quot;X&quot;<br/>
    •    Remove the &quot;$&quot; from all lines<br/>
    •    Remove the &quot;%&quot; from all lines</p>
  <p>The revised Service Invoice reports (SERVICEINVOICEv91b054.rpt and SERVICEINVOICEv90b028.rpt) dated 2021-07-15 adds FORMAT_CARMMU - to show cost &amp; markup rate for lines - that are rate type markup.</p>
  <h3>9.2.1.o Service Invoice Saves in Monthly Directories </h3>
  <p>The revised Service Invoice report (SERVICEINVOICE_v91b054.rpt) dated 2021-10-07 includes new section directory functionality so that reports will be stored in monthly subfolders off of the &#39;Invoices&#39; directory.  This change was made to improve performance when a service invoice is saved. Note that the autosavedirectory key must include ^sectiondirectory^ as the last element of the directory path:</p>
  <p style="margin-left: 88px; text-decoration: underline; ">Example:</p>
  <p style="margin-left: 88px;">Id: sys-report-serviceinvoice</p>
  <p style="margin-left: 88px;">Setting Key: autosavedirectory   Setting Value: \\Sampro\docs\^sectiondirectory^</p>
  <p style="margin-left: 88px;">In the above scenario, a service invoice would be saved in the following location in November, 2021:</p>
  <p style="margin-left: 88px;">\\Sampro\docs\Invoices\2021-11</p>
  <h3 style="margin-left: 12px">9.2.1.p Revised Report Service Invoice:</h3>
  <p><br/>
    In version 9.1.611.059 and up, these revised Service Invoice reports support the Bitmap Override by Dispatcher functionality. When printing Service Invoices, the system will look at the Client Site record referenced in the Work Order to find the Dispatch Id to check for an override id match. If it is referenced in the registry, the override bitmap will be used. If an override bitmap is NOT specified, the system will use the standard bitmap (Setting Key: bitmap) specified in the registry.</p>
  <h3>9.2.1q Defect Corrections Report Service Invoice</h3>
  <p>Service Invoice defect - Reference Number overlays the masked credit card number<br/>
    Previously, using the SERVICEINVOICE report would result in the Reference number provided from Electronic Payments overlaying the masked Credit Card number. Version 9.1.611.061 corrects this defect. <br/>
     </p>
  <h3>9.2.1.1 Customized Service Invoice Reports </h3>
  <p><strong>9.1.611.062</strong></p>
  <p>Customized update to the Service Invoice Report changes the following format:<br/>
    •    The terms below the INVOICE TOTAL section will be removed<br/>
    •    The due date will be written out - e.g. &quot;October 6, 2022&quot;<br/>
    •    Remove the Client and Site from the page header<br/>
    •    Relocate the invoice number, date, and page to the left margin.<br/>
    •    Add payment details to right margin above the location information</p>
  <p>Suppress Work Performed from Equipment Detail<br/>
    This customized update to the Service Invoice Report Format_11X changes the following format:<br/>
    •    Removes the Work Performed from all Equipment</p>
  <p>Equipment Detail must be On. <br/>
    Note: For versions 9.1.611.060 and higher, cache the report definition on first run in a session for performance; it&#39;s necessary to &quot;clear cached reports&quot; to force definitions changes to be effective.</p>
  <p><strong>9.1.611.061</strong></p>
  <p>Service Invoice &quot;=&quot; Error When Importing in Batch<br/>
    When importing this report to SAMPro along with other reports in a batch, this update improves the importing in batches performance for SERVICEWORKSHEETv90b002.rpt<br/>
     </p>
  <h3> 9.2.2 Enhanced Report Progress Invoice Template 3</h3>
  <p>Revised report (RINIVNV3.rpt) dated 2017-08-13 adds the Site Address to the CANADA header format.</p>
  <p>The revised Construction Invoices report (RININV3.rpt) dated 2016-05-12 has been enhanced to show billed retainage as a positive number with the label &#39;Billed Retainage&#39;.  In previous versions of this report, billed retainage was shown as a negative value, with the label &#39;Less Retainage&#39;.</p>
  <p>This report also supports a registry option to override the &#39;Billed Retainage&#39; label.</p>
  <p><span style="font-weight: bold;">Id:</span> sys-report-rininv3</p>
  <p><span style="font-weight: bold;">Setting Key:</span> lbl_billedretainage   <span style="font-weight: bold;">Setting Value:</span> <span style="font-style: italic;">text</span></p>
  <p>This could be implemented to implement the Holdbacks terminology preferred in Canada:</p>
  <p><span style="font-weight: bold;">Setting Key:</span> lbl_billedretainage   <span style="font-weight: bold;">Setting Value:</span> Billed Holdbacks</p>
  <h3>9.2.2a Specify Report Progress Invoice Template 2 Bitmap Override by Job</h3>
  <p>The revised Progress Invoice (RININV3.rpt) dated 2018-05-14 supports the new bitmap override by Job functionality.</p>
  <p><span style="font-weight: bold;">Registry Id:</span> sys-report-rininv3</p>
  <p><span style="font-weight: bold;">Setting Key:</span>  BitmapOverrideBasedOn   <span style="font-weight: bold;">Setting Value:</span> job</p>
  <p>This registry entry defines that this override is based on a user field in the invoice&#39;s Job record.</p>
  <p><span style="font-weight: bold;">Setting Key:</span> BitmapOverrideField  <span style="font-weight: bold;">Setting Value:</span> <span style="font-style: italic;">job user database field</span></p>

As many of these entries may be made as needed to support the various bitmaps.</p>
  <p style="margin-left: 48px;">Example:</p>
  <p style="margin-left: 48px;">Suppose that we have a bitmap file named 010101_invoice.bmp that should be used on invoices associated with Job&#39;s having the following text string 010101 in Job User 3 fields.</p>
  <p style="margin-left: 48px;">Setting Key: Job~010101  Setting Value: <span style="font-style: italic;">path\</span>010101_invoice.bmp</p>
  <p style="margin-left: 8px;"><span style="font-weight: bold;">Tip:</span> Include the part of the bitmap name as the text string for clarity.</p>

  <h3>9.2.3 Report Commissions by Amount Invoiced</h3>
  <p>The Report Commissions by Amount Invoices (RCMMSSNRPT5.rpt) dated 2018-02-20 has been updated to include logic for discounts upon receipt. This report requires that total received must match total invoiced to qualify; to prevent qualifying an invoice for commission prior to the complete payment. This version corrects an issue where invoices were missing on the report if a discount was applied. This version shows such invoices as well as the computation for the amount received.</p>
  <h3>9.2.4 New Report: Consolidated Invoice Report</h3>
  <p>The new Consolidated Invoice Report (RCNSLDTDINVCE.rpt) is used to combine multiple invoices for a client within a specified date range. The consolidated invoice includes such details as the AR Invoice ID, purchase number, client site name, invoice subtotal amount, tax amount, and total invoice amount for each invoice being consolidated. The total line on this report corresponds to the consolidated invoice subtotal, tax, and total amount. The registry for this report includes bitmap placement and auto emailing functionality.</p>
  <h3>9.2.5 New Report Job Tax Certificate Expiration</h3>
  <p>The Report Job Tax Certificate Expiration  (RJBTXCRTFCTE.rpt) runs off the Job Tax Certificates table. Any Job&#39;s with Tax Certificates what have expired between the Start and End Dates specified in the report will be included on the report.  Job, Branch, Project Manager and Job Type ranges allow the report to be filtered as needed.</p>
  <h3><span style="font-weight: bold;">9.2.6 Progress Billing Posting Report</span></h3>
  <p>When posting an RININV3 job, the posting audit report now displays the GL Entity for the Retainage account. The Entity is on the Job and shows on the summary screen of the ‘Record Billing Adjustments’, but did not show at posting time in previous releases.</p>
  <h3>9.2.7 Service Billing Worksheet</h3>
  <p>Report Service Worksheet: SERVICEWORKSHEETv90b002.rpt</p>
  <p><span style="font-weight: normal;">The revised report dated 2022-07-20 will improve performance and update the report.</span></p>

  <h2>9.3 Guaranteed Maximum Price (GMP) Billing</h2>
  <h3>9.3.1 Overview</h3>
  <p>GMP (Guaranteed Maximum Pricing) implements Cost Plus / Not-To-Exceed invoicing where the Percent Overhead is used to calculate the profit. GMP Contract and GMP SoV are both supported. Billing is accomplished via Record Billing Adjustments. GMP Jobs must NOT be flagged as Service Compute.</p>
  <h3>9.3.2 Record Changes to Support GMP</h3>
  <h5>Job Record Invoicing Tab:</h5>
  <p style="font-weight: bold;">New Field: Job Contract Type</p>
  <p style="margin-left: 48px;">Unknown: This option is selected by default when data is converted from an earlier version.</p>

  <p style="margin-left: 48px;">T&amp;M:  This option would be used to identify Time and Material Jobs.  Note that validation is still performed at the Billing Item level.</p>
  <p style="margin-left: 48px;">GMP Contract: When GMP Contract is selected, the maximum price for the Job as a whole must not exceed the sum of the Contract values in its Billing Items / Change Orders which are flagged as Include in GMP. If the sum of the Billing Item / Change Order values was exceeded (and Include in GMP is flagged) , a Job Journal entry will be generated via when Record Billing Adjustments saved if the Job is brought back into compliance.</p>
  <p style="margin-left: 48px;">GMP SoV: When GMP SoV is selected, the maximum price for each Billing Item / Change Order flagged as Include in GMP must not be exceeded.</p>
  <p style="margin-left: 8px; font-weight: bold;">New Field - GMP Contact Total:<br/>
    <span style="font-weight: normal;">This field specifies the Not To Exceed amount for GMP Contract and SoV type Jobs. When this field is updated, the system will validate that sum of the C.O. Amount (in Change Orders) and Contract Amount (in Billing Items) does not exceed the GMP Contract Total.</span>
  </p>
  <h5>Job Billing Item</h5>
  <p style="font-weight: bold;">Main Tab</p>
  <p style="margin-left: 48px;"><span style="font-weight: bold;">New Field - Include in GMP?</span><br/>

  <p style="font-weight: bold; margin-left: 48px;">Changed Field - Original Contract:<br/>
    <span style="font-weight: normal;">For GMP type Jobs, changes to this field are now validated against the Job&#39;s GMP Contract Total field. The sum of the C.O. Amount (in Change Orders) and Contract Amount (in Billing Items) may not exceed the GMP Contract Total.</span>
  </p>
  <p style="font-weight: bold;">Invoicing Tab</p>
  <p style="margin-left: 48px;"><span style="font-weight: bold;">New Field - Bill Item Group:</span><br/>

  <p style="margin-left: 48px;"><span style="font-weight: bold;">New Field - Include in GMP?</span><br/>
    This field must be checked if this Change Order should be included in GMP Revenue Adjustment calculations. If this field is checked, the Fixed Fee box MUST be blank.</p>
  <p style="margin-left: 48px;"><span style="font-weight: bold;">Changed Field - C.O. Amount</span><br/>
    For GMP type Jobs, changes to this field are now validated against the Job&#39;s GMP Contract Total field. The sum of the C.O. Amount (in Change Orders) and Contract Amount (in Billing Items) may not exceed the GMP Contract Total.</p>

  <h5>Job Cost Code Record</h5>
  <p style="font-weight: bold;">New Tab: GMP</p>
  <p style="margin-left: 48px;"><span style="font-weight: bold;">GMP %:</span><br/>
    This field is used to calculate the add-on fee for GMP jobs. It should be completed for Job Cost Codes used for GMP Fees. It should NOT be completed for Job Cost Codes used for GMP Revenue Adjustments. Fees are calculated when Start Compute GMP Special Revenue is run as a scheduled event or when Record Billing Adjustments is run.</p>
  <p style="margin-left: 48px;"><span style="font-weight: bold;">Cost Cat:</span><br/>
    This field should only be completed if it is for a Job Cost Code which will be used in GMP Revenue Adjustment/Over Contract JCH entries. The Cost Category should have a Posting Cost Type &amp; a Selection Cost Type of Other.</p>

  <p style="font-weight: bold;">Main Tab:</p>
  <p style="font-weight: bold; margin-left: 48px;">New Revenue Display Field - Over Contract:<br/>
    <span style="font-weight: normal;">This field is only used for GMP Contract type Jobs. It will be completed by the system if the sum of the Billing Item / Change Order values is exceeded (and Include in GMP is flagged). When Record Billing Adjustments is saved, a Job Journal entry will be generated to with a description of &quot;** GMP Over Contract **&quot; to account for changes to GMP Over Contract calculations.</span>

  <p style="font-weight: bold; margin-left: 48px;">C.O. Amount  - Contract Original<br/>
    <span style="font-weight: normal;">These fields may be adjusted for GMP type Jobs. For example, the CO Amount might be changed if additional work was found. Changes to these fields are validated against the Job&#39;s GMP Contract Total field. The sum of the C.O. Amount and Original Contract Amounts may not exceed the GMP Contract Total.</span>

     <br/>
    The Setting value must specify the Id for all Job Cost Code records used for GMP Revenue Adjustments used to account for Over Contract transactions (but not the fees themselves).</p>
  <p style="margin-left: 48px;">For GMP Contract type billing, these Job Cost Code records should reference the Billing Item used to show the Over Contract entry on the AIA invoice (requires specific AIA report).</p>
  <p style="margin-left: 48px;">For GMP SoV type billing the Billing Item does not need to be entered. A new GMP tab has also been added to the Job Cost Code record.</p>
  <h3>9.3.5 Start Compute GMP Special Revenue / Start Compute GMP Special Revenue (Automated)</h3>
  <p>These starter functions compute and post the revenue adjustments (fees) needed for some GMP type jobs. This special revenue will be posted to Job History as Job Journal entries (of transaction type Actual)  so that they will be available for progress invoicing. The Job Journal Parent Date/Period is set from the first child line.</p>
  <p>The Job Journal&#39;s header Description will be set to &quot;GMP Special Revenue&quot;. The revenue will appear on the Job Journal&#39;s Expenses tab.  The Description on Expense detail will indicate the calculation used to determine the fee:</p>
  <p>$33.00 * 10.0000% - $0.00 (Daily Basis Base Revenue * GMP % - Posted Revenue)</p>
  <p>The Automated version is designed to be run as a scheduled event at least daily.  The Automated version is also launched for a specific Job when it is loaded into Record Billing Adjustments.</p>
  <h5>Important Fields:</h5>
  <p><span style="font-weight: bold;">As Of GMP Date:</span><br/>
    This field specifies the date as of which the Special Revenue is computed. It will default to today&#39;s date unless otherwise specified via registry.</p>
  <p><span style="font-weight: bold;">Job Id:</span><br/>
    This filter allows the user to limit the Jobs this function is run for.</p>

  <p><span style="font-weight: bold;">Registry Id:</span> sys-start-scmptegmpspclrvne   </p>
  <p>This registry is shared by the automated and manual Start Compute GMP Special Revenue functions.</p>
  <h5>Option to Default As Of GMP Date</h5>
  <p><span style="font-weight: bold;">Setting Key:</span> AsOfGMPDate  <span style="font-weight: bold;"> Setting Value:</span> today   (default is today)</p>

  <h3>9.3.6 Start Recompute T&amp;M Revenue</h3>
  <h5>Purpose:</h5>
  <p>It is not always possible to finalize the job setup for its construction jobs prior to real costs posting to JCH.  This includes the list of Cost Codes, the Schedule of Values (Billing Items), the Default Billing Items for Cost Codes, the Rate Schedule info, etc.</p>
  <p>This function&#39;s purpose is to retroactively apply Rate Schedule rates to already-posted JCH data for a user-specified Job. If enabled via registry, the Job Billing Item in Job History will be forced to match the Job Cost Code&#39;s Job Billing Item; this is not recommended for non-USE installations.</p>
  <p>The function presents a list of qualifying job history entries for this Job.  For each selected JCH entry, it &#39;re-thinks&#39; billing information and updates the JCH record when changes are required.</p>
  <p>This function also evaluates and makes adjusting Job Journal entries for billed JCH data. For any JCH entries that qualify for re computation, a Job Journal entry is generated to capture the difference in revenue amounts after the function is run. The Job Journal entries are then eligible for billing and could result in an additional invoice or a credit memo.</p>
  <p>Version 9.1.611.058 and above prevents recomputed Unit Prices from having fractional pennies which could result in spurious lines appearing on an service invoice when they should have canceled out in Job History. This release also correctly recomputes Inventory lines based on the Material Markup table.</p>
  <h3>Registry:</h3>
  <p>In releases prior to 9.1.611.049, running this function always forced the Job Billing Item in Job History to match the Job Cost Code&#39;s Job Billing Item; this was not ideal for most users.</p>
  <p>The following registry should only be enabled if the Job Billing Item in Job History <span style="font-weight: bold;">should</span> be forced to match the Job Cost Code&#39;s Job Billing Item when this function is run (USE).  This registry is designed to be used by USE to maintain the previous default functionality where when the Job Billing Item in Job History WAS forced to match the Job Cost Code&#39;s Billing Item when this function was run.</p>
  <p><span style="font-weight: bold;">Id:</span> sys-start-scmptejchunblldrvne</p>
  <p><span style="font-weight: bold;">Setting Key:</span>  ResetJCHBillingItemFromCostCode  <span style="font-weight: bold;">Setting Value:</span> true (default false)</p>
  <p><span style="font-weight: bold;">Warning</span>: This registry should <span style="font-weight: bold;">NOT</span> be set for most installations as it will cause issues with non-USE KPIs.</p>
  <h5>Usage:</h5>
  <p>This process cannot be performed on a job that has an Invoice Status of either &#39;Ready&#39; or &#39;Printed&#39;.  If the specified job has an Invoice Status of either &#39;Ready&#39; or &#39;Printed&#39;, the user is given the opportunity (via form prompter) to reset the status to Hold.  The user can either abort the recompute or elect to have the status reset to &#39;Hold&#39;.</p>
  <p>Entries Which Are Skipped:</p>
  <p style="margin-left: 48px;">1. GMP Special Revenue-type rows will be processed ONLY for the purpose of resetting their Billing Item Rns when necessary.  Their revenue values will NOT be recomputed.</p>
  <p style="margin-left: 48px;">2. Entries from the following source journals are skipped:</p>
  <p style="margin-left: 88px;">AR Cash Receipts - AR Sales - GL Journal<br/>
    Job Budget - Job Cost EOM<br/>
    Bill Adjustment - IM Journal -<br/>
    Quote Budget - Projected Cost - PR Check<br/>
    Shop Ticket - Shop Order Jrnl</p>
  <p style="margin-left: 48px;">3. Reversing and reversed entries are skipped.</p>
  <p>Entries Which Make the Selection List:</p>
  <p style="margin-left: 48px;">1. Entries that satisfy one or more of the following revenue-based criteria:</p>
  <p style="margin-left: 88px;">(a) new Revenue Rate, (b) new Billing Rate Type Id, (c) new Extended Revenue.</p>
  <p style="margin-left: 48px;">2. Entries also make the selection list when the JCH Billing Item no longer matches the Default Billing Item from the JCH Cost Code record.</p>
  <p style="margin-left: 48px;">3. Both billed and unbilled JCH data (supporting the above criteria) will be considered. .</p>
  <p>Record Change Log entries are created for each changed JCH record and changed Source Journal Record.</p>
  <p>An attempt is made to find and update the corresponding original source journal child lines to keep them consistent with the revised JCH.  Values updated are the Revenue Rate, Unit Price, Extended Price, Billing Rate Type Id and Billing Item.</p>

  <h3>9.5.1 Parent Tab</h3>
  <p style="margin-left: 8px; font-weight: bold;">Auto Fill Button:</p>
  <p style="margin-left: 8px;">Previously, reversing a Cash Receipt entry did NOT restore an Invoice&#39;s qualifications to be included on a Consolidated Invoice.  In this release, if the net payment amount is NOT zero, the Consolidated Invoice Viewer allows Invoices to be added, either manually or via the AutoFill button.</p>
  <p style="margin-left: 8px;">Clicking the Auto Fill button now correctly displays the AR Inv Amt in the ARInvoices list.</p>
  <p><span style="font-weight: bold;">Changed Field: Invoice Description</span><br/>
    The Invoice Description field has been expanded from 400 to 3000 characters.  </p>
  <p><span style="font-weight: bold;">Changed Field - Invoice Amount:</span><br/>
    Refines display of this field to correctly handle credit memos and bad debts listed in the AR Invoices tab.</p>
  <h3>9.5.2 AR Invoices Tab</h3>
  <p><span style="font-weight: bold;">Changed Field - AR Invoice Id:</span><br/>
    Previously, reversing a Cash Receipt entry did NOT restore an Invoice&#39;s qualifications to be included on a Consolidated Invoice.  In this release, if the net payment amount is NOT zero, the Consolidated Invoice Viewer allows Invoices to be added, either manually or via the AutoFill button.</p>
  <p><span style="font-weight: bold;">Changed Field - AR Inv. Amt:</span><br/>
    This release corrects the display of the AR Invoice Amount column so that it doesn&#39;t blank when the Consolidated Invoice is saved.</p>
  <p><span style="font-weight: bold;">New Column: Amount Due</span><br/>
    This new column displays the amount not yet paid on this Invoice.</p>
  <h2>9.6 Other Rates</h2>
  <h3>9.6.1 Important Configuration Tip for Other Rate Table</h3>
  <p>If a Subcontractor PO is generated without an Other Rate Id, and you try to partially voucher it in the AP Journal it will change the Bill Type ID to n/a and remove the Revenue Rate. To avoid this problem, add a line to Other Rate tables related to Subcontractors to define how the Bill Type Id and Revenue Rate should be set if an Other Rate was NOT specified.</p>
  <p style="margin-left: 48px;">Example: Set the Revenue Based on the Amount:</p>
  <p style="margin-left: 48px;">Other Rate Table Child Tab</p>
  <p style="margin-left: 48px;">Other Rate Id:  (blank)</p>
  <p style="margin-left: 48px;">Level: 99,999,999.99</p>
  <p style="margin-left: 48px;">Rate: 1.00</p>
  <p style="margin-left: 48px;">Bill Type: Multiplier</p>
  <h3>9.6.2 Other Rate Defaulting</h3>
  <p style="margin-left: 8px;">In this release, the Bill Type defaults from the Billing Rate Type specified in the Other Rate record (if not overridden by the Other Rate Table) instead of defaulting to n/a. This allows for any potential revenue to calculate when the Other Rate is manually added or imported into a work order (unless n/a is specified in the Other Rate record. In previous versions if an Other Rate record did not specify a Standard Rate, and was missing from the Rate Schedule&#39;s Other Rate table, the Bill Type would default to n/a.</p>
  <h3>9.6.7 New Tab: References</h3>
  <p>This tab displays all Rate Schedules associated with this Other Rate via the Other Rate Table. Only Other Rate Tables referenced on a Rate Schedule will appear on this tab.</p>
  <p><span style="font-weight: bold;">Rate Schedule - Description</span><br/>
    The Rate Schedule Id and Description this Other Rate is associated with.</p>
  <p><span style="font-weight: bold;">Start - End</span><br/>
    The Starting and Ending Date of the Rate Schedule.</p>
  <p><span style="font-weight: bold;">Other Rate Table - Rate Type - Rate</span><br/>
    These fields default from the Other Rate Table entry for this Other Rate.</p>
  <h2><span style="font-weight: bold;">9.7 Rate Schedule</span></h2>
  <p style="margin-left: 8px;">When the Rate Schedule is saved, the detail lines are re-ordered with the most recent entries at the top. Validation prevents overlapping date ranges and gaps.</p>
  <h2>9.8  Record Billing Adjustments</h2>
  <p>Previously when the retainage was calculated by Record Billing Adjustments after a Posted Invoice has been Reversed, they did not add up the to correct billing on line 8. The 9.1.611.062 update corrects how retainage gets recalculated by Record Billing Adjustments after a Posted Invoice has been Reversed.</p>
  <p>Version 9.1.611.056 corrects a sporadic Runtime Error &quot;Key is Missing&quot; related to secondary progress meters. These have been removed since they were unnecessary. This release also corrects a rounding issue from submissions from DBAnalytics&#39; Progress Manager&#39;s Workbench by always using the PMWB Submitted Next Invoice $ amount. Finally, this release corrects a rounding problem with negative retainage so it is calculated correctly.</p>
  <p>The following issues were corrected in earlier releases:</p>
  <p style="margin-left: 48px;">Corrects a sporadic problem where the Tax Base on the Taxes tab did not match the Computed Tax Base on the Main tab. The error was caused by negative revenue lines on the Other/Lab tabs not being accumulated correctly.</p>
  <p style="margin-left: 48px;">Corrects the following sporadic errors: Runtime error: &quot;containsPoint:&quot; not understood and &#39;last character must be sign or digit&#39;.</p>
  <p style="margin-left: 48px;">Corrects a problem in recent versions which did not allow negative Change Orders to be processed.</p>
  <p style="margin-left: 8px;">A registry entry is available to automatically restarts at the Job Id input screen after clicking Save. Cliking the red X closes the function so it will not reopen. See 9.1.4 for details.</p>
  <h3>9.8.1 Record Billing Adjustments Sales / Use Tax Validation</h3>
  <p>Validation has been added to warn the user if Sales or Use Tax has not been computed when the invoice is saved as Ready to Print. Validation has been extended to warn the user if Exempt Jobs have not had their Exempt Amount  computed when the invoice is set / saved as Ready to Print.</p>
  <p>The following warning will be displayed if a sales or use taxable invoice is saved as Ready To Print if there is a Next Invoice Amount but the Taxes tab is blank.</p>
  <p style="margin-left: 48px;">Warning: Compute Sales Tax has not been Pressed.</p>
  <p style="margin-left: 48px;">Ok to continue?</p>
  <p style="margin-left: 8px;">Click No to return to Record Billing Adjustments to click Compute Sales Tax before saving. If you click Yes to continue, the appropriate entries will NOT be made to the Sales Tax Table which is used for Tax reporting.</p>
  <h2>9.9 Start Job Invoice Reverse</h2>
  <p>This release includes an enhancement designed to correct a sporadic Reverse Invoice - SQL Lock interaction.</p>
  <p><span style="font-weight: bold;">T</span>he Work Order COD Tab&#39;s Invoice Reference is now cleared during the Job Invoice Reverse so that the user may edit the COD child tab before re-billing the Work Order.</p>
  <p><span style="font-weight: bold;">Changed Field: Effective Date</span><br/>
    Validation has been added to prevent the reversal&#39;s Effective Date from preceding the invoice&#39;s original Effective Date.</p>
  <p>When this reversal function is run, the Invoice Master will retain it&#39;s the original Effective Date,but now writes the reversal&#39;s Effective Date to the new Invoice Reversed Effective Date fields in the Invoice Master record. The Accounting Period and Description of the reversal will also be written to the new Invoice Reversed fields.</p>
  <h3>9.9.1 Start Job Invoice Reverse Registry</h3>
  <p>This update provides a way for users to self-serve resolving situations where invoice post-process is completed, but document management fails. Users will be able to reverse and reuse to regenerate invoices, postings, and successful documents consistent with the original.</p>
  <p>This update also revises Service Invoice posting processing orders so that XML, Document records, and new scheduled event records can be created or committed as ARSJ postings do. This saves processing time for users and provides enhanced recoverability in the event of externalities that currently result in document attachment failures.</p>

  <h2><span style="font-weight: bold;">9.10 Invoice Master and Sales Journal Invoice Master Tab</span></h2>
  <p><span style="font-weight: bold;">New Field: PO#</span><br/>
    The Invoice Master PO# is now displayed in this field. This field only supports the Customer&#39;s PO# for Service Compute and Progress Jobs.</p>
  <p><span style="font-weight: bold;">Changed Field - Effective Date:</span><br/>
    The Effective Date of the Invoice. In Version 9.0 and below, this field was revised if the Invoice was reversed so that it falls within the reversal Accounting Period.  In Version 9.1, the reversal function retains the Effective Date, but writes the reversal&#39;s Effective Date to the field below.</p>
  <p style="font-weight: bold;">New Fields:  - Invoice Reversed:</p>
  <p><span style="font-weight: bold;">Period Id:   Effective Date: Description:</span><br/>
    These fields have been added to allow an invoice to be reversed without changing the original Effective Date of the invoice. These fields will be updated when Reverse Job Invoice is run.</p>
  <h2>9.11 Avalara Sales Tax - Import Files</h2>
  <p>See Customer Note 6.6 for the Avalara Web Service information.</p>
  <h3><span style="font-weight: bold;">9.11.1</span> Sales Tax Updates with Zero Rate Authorities</h3>
  <p>In previous releases, updating existing Sales Tax Authorities / Groups from Avalara ignored updates where the Sales Rate was changed to zero because zero tax rate Authorities were ignored.  In this release, zero tax rates updates are properly accounted for when Tax Group records are updated. However, as a result of this change, updated and newly processed Tax Groups will include Tax Authority records with zero tax rates if applicable.</p>
  <p>This release also corrects a sporadic issue where the Sales Tax Authority information was too large to fit in the Use Tax Info fields on the detail lines of the AP Journal; Inventory Adjustments Journal; Inventory Receipts Journal; Purchase Order; and Work Order viewers. This issue emerged when updated Tax Groups included zero rate Authorities.  </p>
  <p style="margin-left: 48px;"><span style="font-weight: bold;">WARNING:</span> Do Not Filter the Avalara Update<br/>
    If you filter your Avalara update to a specific Zip Code, only that Sales Tax Group would have its Sales Tax Group Rate recalculated. If the update to that Group included changes to rates also impacting other Group (e.g., the State Rate), the applicable Tax Authority would be updated, but the other Tax Groups referencing it would not have their Group Tax Rates reset. This is a particular problem since TechAnywhere uses the Group Tax Rate. For this reason, we strongly recommend that you allow your Avalara updates to run wide open so that all applicable Sales Tax Groups will be properly updated.</p>
  <h2>9.12 Sales Tax Authority</h2>
  <h3>9.12.1 Sales Tax Authority GL Entities</h3>
  <p>The system now incorporates Sales Tax Authority GL Entities into credit-side tax cost processing when the GL Entity is not set from other sources.</p>
  <p style="margin-left: 48px;"><span style="font-weight: bold;">Purchase Order Inventory and General lines:</span><br/>
    Now uses GL Entity from the PO parent when available, otherwise from Tax Authority. Previously, only the PO parent&#39;s GL Entity was considered.</p>
  <p style="margin-left: 48px;"><span style="font-weight: bold;">AP Journal: All child lines</span><br/>
    Now uses GL Entity from the AP parent when available, otherwise from Tax Authority. Previously, only the AP parent&#39;s GL Entity was considered.</p>
  <p style="margin-left: 48px;"><span style="font-weight: bold;">Inventory Adjustment Journal:</span><br/>
    Now uses GL Entity from the parent when available, otherwise from Tax Authority. Previously, tax costs from To/From used the associated Company Balance Sheet GL Entity.  </p>
  <p style="margin-left: 48px;"><span style="font-weight: bold;">Work Order Inventory / Other Lines</span><br/>
    The system now uses the GL Entity from the Tax Authority when not supplied by other defaults (e.g., Company Balance Sheet GL Entity).</p>
  <p style="margin-left: 48px;"><span style="font-weight: bold;">Work Order Entry</span><br/>
    The system now uses the GL Entity from the Tax Authority when not supplied by other defaults (e.g., Company Balance Sheet GL Entity).</p>
  <p style="margin-left: 48px;"><span style="font-weight: bold;">Inventory Receipt Journal</span><br/>
    The system now uses the GL Entity from the Tax Authority when not supplied by other defaults.</p>
  <h2>9.13 Create PM Billing</h2>
  <p style="margin-left: 8px;">Previously during the Create PM Billing process, when a Credit Card alias would be declined, the system stopped and threw a message/error at every entry that declined. When this happened, users would have to select OK on two separate messages. This causes a halt when users were mass batches were processed. Now the error messages are suppressed from displaying as a window as they error, and a document is produced at the end of the batch with a list of failures, their IDs, and the error message so they can be addressed.</p>
  <p style="margin-left: 8px;">In previous releases, Work Orders created from Create PM Billings were inheriting the Cost Code&#39;s GL Entity. The WO-COD GL Entity (for automatic credit card transactions) will now default from the Job&#39;s GL Entities (the Job&#39;s GL A/R Entity first, then the Job&#39;s primary GL Entity) &#39;instead of auto-loading from Cost Code.</p>
  <p style="margin-left: 8px;">This release corrects an &#39;Index - collection out of bounds error&#39; that occurred if the workstation was on military (24 hour) time.</p>
  <p style="margin-left: 8px;">This release corrects a recent problem generating billings for Client Sites with a payment alias setup for automatic credit card payments.</p>
  <h3>9.13.1 Create PM Billing Checklist</h3>
  <p style="margin-left: 8px; font-weight: bold;"><span style="font-weight: normal;">Validation now checks for duplicate invoice lines. If one is detected, it will not be checked when the checklist is displayed or when Check All is clicked. If this occurs, the user should review the list, but should NOT check the duplicate line.</span></p>
  <h3>9.13.2 Create PM Billing Range Screen</h3>
  <p style="margin-left: 8px; font-weight: bold;">New Field: Company Id<br/>
    <span style="font-weight: normal;">The Company Id has been added to new Interco v.cus files. It is required for Intercompany users.</span>
  </p>
  <h2>9.14 Start Compute Service Invoice</h2>
  <p>This update provides more details on diagnosing issues while in service invoicing when a user encounters an error. When an error occurs, a warning message appears and says &quot;An issue occurred when posting the Service Invoice, please re-run the batch. If the problem persists, please contact support to resolve the issue.&quot;</p>
  <p>If Service Invoices will be auto-emailed or saved as PDF&#39;s, the user will be alerted if the Java runtime is not available, and will not be allowed to continue invoicing. The check for java was moved up in the process it version 9.1.611.058 to ensure the user doesn&#39;t don&#39;t go down a path that eventually has a dead-end (if Java not installed).</p>
  <p style="margin-left: 8px;">This release corrects a sporadic issue setting the Sales Tax Authority records in the Invoice Master when running batch computes with multiple Warranty Jobs.</p>
  <p style="margin-left: 8px;">When Service Compute is run, an entry to the WO&#39;s Log Tab will be made: set the Status to Billed, the Date Logged and Work Date to today&#39;s date, and the User Id to person running the Compute.</p>
  <h2>9.15 Invoice Master</h2>
  <p style="margin-left: 8px;">This release provides an option to clear the &#39;Unknown&#39; Status condition using the Invoice Master viewer&#39;s Record &gt; Clear Unknown menu option to Full users with access to the Invoice Master record. Doing so will clear the Invoice Id from Job History, set the Invoice Master Status to Computed making it eligible to be reused, and set the Effective Date to 1900-01-01.</p>
  <p style="margin-left: 8px;">Usage restrictions are as follows ...</p>
  <p style="margin-left: 48px;">1. Status = Unknown</p>
  <p style="margin-left: 48px;">2. Entry Type = Sales</p>
  <p style="margin-left: 48px;">3. Can&#39;t have any prior AR activity.</p>
  <p style="margin-left: 48px;">4. Must be Full or Special User with ability to Access/Change Invoice Master Record (this functionality was previously restricted to users running in development mode).</p>
  <p style="font-weight: bold; margin-left: 8px;">Note On Compute Service Invoice<br/>
    <span style="font-weight: normal;">When Compute Service Invoice is run, the Invoice Master Status is now set to &#39;Computed&#39; when gracefully rolling back a cancelled invoice run (where the user did not confirm that the invoices had printed successfully). Previously, the Service Invoice code set the Invoice Master Status to &#39;Unknown&#39; for both normal and abnormal termination of the process. Immediately following an abnormal termination the Status will be the #UserId temporary marker.  Next time the same User processes ANY service invoices, the Status will be changed from the temporary marker to &#39;Unknown&#39;.</span>
  </p>
  <h2>9.16 Start Resend Emailed Invoices</h2>
  <p style="font-weight: bold;">New features: Range Screen</p>
  <p>The user is now warned if both of the date ranges are blank.</p>
  <p style="font-weight: bold;">New Option: Skip Paid Invoices<br/>
    <span style="font-weight: normal;">When this box is checked, only invoices with unpaid balances will appear on the checklist.</span>  
  </p>
  <p><span style="font-weight: bold;">New feature: Checklist</span><br/>
    The Email To field on the list screen has been opened, allowing the email address to be changed if needed.</p>
  <h2><span style="font-weight: bold;">9.17 Progress Billing Post (Start Job Invoice Post)</span> </h2>
  <p>When running in Intercompany mode, the system now validates that a Company has been selected from the list. Only invoices belonging to the selected Company are eligible for the post.<span style="font-weight: bold;"> </span></p>
  <h3><span style="font-weight: bold;">9.18 Stored Material</span></h3>
  <p><span style="font-weight: bold;"></span>In version 9.1.611.059 and up, this field is used to record Stored Material for AIA Billing. Enter the desired amount to reflect on the AIA billing, and note that this value should also be encompassed in the Cntrct NxtInv amount for that particular bill item.  There is no functionality to &quot;release&quot; Stored Material values on subsequent invoices for that job; those values are adjusted manually by the user.  Specifying stored materials is simply telling the customer how much of the amount the user invoiced is stored materials. If users want to JUST bill for stored materials, ensure the next invoice amount and the stored materials amount are equal. Contact your Data-Basics Support Representative for details on invoicing formats to support this information.</p>
  <h1>10 GL / Bank Journals</h1>
  <h2>10.1 GL / Bank Journal Registries</h2>
  <h3>10.1.1 Bank Deposit Journal <span style="font-weight: bold;">- Set GL Entity for Intercompany Installations </span></h3>
  <p>If Intercompany is enabled, the balance sheet GL Entity is not &#39;sticky&#39;. Customer Note 1.14 details the new registries for setting the Default Balance Sheet Entity for this journal or globally.</p>
  <h3>10.1.2  Bank Transfer Journal <span style="font-weight: bold;">- Set GL Entity for Intercompany Installations </span></h3>
  <p>If Intercompany is enabled, the balance sheet GL Entity is not &#39;sticky&#39;. Customer Note 1.14 details the new registries for setting the Default Balance Sheet Entity for this journal or globally.</p>
  <h3>10.1.3  Bank Reconciliation Journal <span style="font-weight: bold;">- Set GL Entity for Intercompany Installations </span></h3>
  <p>If Intercompany is enabled, the balance sheet GL Entity is not &#39;sticky&#39;. Customer Note 1.14 details the new registries for setting the Default Balance Sheet Entity for this journal or globally.</p>
  <h3>10.1.4 Bank Reconciliation Journal - Registry to Auto Fill Checks as Not Cleared</h3>
  <p>The default behavior of the Checks tab determines the &quot;Cleared&quot; boolean by comparing each imported check&#39;s date to the Date Effective in the parent. If the date of the incoming check is less than or equal to the Date Effective, the new line is set to &quot;Cleared&quot;, otherwise it is left blank. The new registry determines whether to override the date comparison and simply always set the new line to not cleared, but only when not in Add Mode.<br/>
    <span style="font-weight: bold;">Registry Id:</span> sys-viewer-vbnkrcncltnjrnl
  </p>
  <p><span style="font-weight: bold;">Setting Key:</span> AutoFillChecksDefaultCleared  <span style="font-weight: bold;">Setting Value:</span> T/Y/F/N/Prompt</p>
  <p>If the registry is set to <span style="font-weight: bold;">T</span> or <span style="font-weight: bold;">Y</span> or not set at all, the behavior remains the same as before the registry, where the date of the check and effective date are used to determine if the new line is Cleared.</p>
  <p>If the registry is set to <span style="font-weight: bold;">F</span> or <span style="font-weight: bold;">N</span> new lines will never be marked Cleared.</p>
  <p>If the registry is set to <span style="font-weight: bold;">Prompt</span>, when pressing the AutoFill button, users will be asked &quot;Prevent Incoming Checks from being Cleared?&quot;. A No response is treated the same as the F/N registry, a Yes response is treated the same as T/Y registry. Note that if there are no new incoming check lines, the prompt will not display because there is no data to process.</p>
  <p>Previously, the AutoFillChecksDefaultCleared registry determined whether to override the date comparison and simply always set the new line to not be &quot;cleared.&quot; An exception was made to ONLY apply to existing reconciliation transactions (save mode). The setting did not apply when adding a new reconciliation record (add mode).  The 9.1.611.062 update corrects this behavior to allow it to match behavior when adding.</p>
  <h2>10.2. GL / Bank Journal Reports</h2>
  <h3><span style="font-weight: bold;">10.2.1 Report Journal Listing GL Entries</span></h3>
  <p>The report (RGLJRNL.rpt) dated 2016-12-16 fixes a sporadic issue where the report did not match the GL Journal viewer total debits and credits.</p>
  <h3><span style="font-weight: bold;">10.2.2 Bank Deposit Journal Report</span></h3>
  <p>The new Bank Deposit Journal Report (BNKDPST.rpt) prints the Journal Entries and their associated receipts. The report runs by the bank GL Account and a Start/End date based on the Bank Deposit Effective Date.</p>
  <h3>10.2.3 <span style="font-weight: bold;">GL Report Writer:</span></h3>
  <p>GL Reports (.grpt) now omit printing lines for Obsolete GL Accounts when the line has no non-zero columns. This is regardless of the IncludeZeroLines registry entry.</p>
  <h3>10.2.4 Revised Report - GL Account History by Job Component Report (CGLHSTRYJB)</h3>
  <p>Report GL Account History by Job (DGLHSTRYJB.rpt) is a drilldown report with an option to include accounts with no activity. Previously, drilling down to an account with no activity displayed a blank page in the component report. The revised component report (CGLHSTRYJB.rpt) dated 2019-01-19 or later displays the account header information (GL Account and Job Beginning and Ending Balances) even if no account activity took place during the date range specified on the drilldown report.</p>
  <h3>10.2.5 GL Report Import / Export</h3>
  <p>In previous releases, the user could not Export / Import GL Reports using a directory path that began with &#39;\\&#39; because the system prefixed the directory path with &#39;C:\&#39; if the directory path began with &#39;\\&#39;.  In this release these functions work correctly whether the directory path specifies a named drive or a url.</p>
  <h2>10.3 GL Journal</h2>
  <p>A warning is now displayed when the user first accesses a journal entry which has been replaced by one with a higher &#39;tack&#39; number. This warning is designed to prevent the user from wasting time by attempting to make changes to a journal entry record which cannot be saved because it has already been replaced. See Customer Note 1.1.2 for a registry to disable this warning globally or by individual viewer.</p>
  <p>In Version 9.0 and above, original EOM UVP entries posted a WorkOrder Reference Id to GL History.  However, because this field was not part GL Journal itself, edited GL Journal entries lost the WO references for both the reversing and new go-forward entries. In this release, a new GL Journal column has been added (newgljrnllst.gljrnllst_rfrnce_wrkordr_rn). When EOM UVP (GL Journal) entries created in this release or later are edited, the WO reference in the reversing and go forward entries is retained in GL History.</p>
  <h3>10.3.1 GL Journal - Import .CSV file</h3>
  <p><img alt="" border="0" src="assets/images/SKIN1_ImportCSV.bmp" style="border: none;"/> The new Import .CSV button supports the import of a .csv file use to generate a GL Journal entry. When the GL Journal header information is entered and the icon is clicked, a browser window will be opened to a registry-defined folder to allow the user to select a .csv file to import as the GL Journal child lines.  </p>
  <p>The import process includes an option that allows imported lines to APPEND to or REPLACE(default) existing child rows.  The Import loads the child rows.<span style="font-weight: bold;"> The User is responsible for saving the transaction.</span></p>
  <h3>Registry:</h3>
  <p>This optional registry setting supports the specification of a default path to CSV files.  </p>
  <p><span style="font-weight: bold;">Id:</span> sys-viewer-vgljrnllst</p>
  <p><span style="font-weight: bold;">Setting Key:</span> ImportFilePath   Setting Value: <span style="font-style: italic;">full</span> <span style="font-style: italic;">path</span></p>
  <p>This is the directory you want SAMPro to open to for selecting the CSV file; this directory must exist. The Windows browser will open to the this folder when you click the Import CSV button.</p>
  <h3>CSV File Definition:</h3>
  <p>Each CSV file must contain a header row which serves as a column map.  There are five required column headers:</p>
  <p style="margin-left: 48px;"><span style="font-weight: bold;">GLAccountId</span> - a valid GL Account Id (required)</p>
  <p style="margin-left: 48px;"><span style="font-weight: bold;">GLEntityId</span> - a valid GL Entity Id</p>
  <p style="margin-left: 48px;"><span style="font-weight: bold;">Debits</span> - Decimal field, 99999999.99 / -99999999.99 max, no commas</p>
  <p style="margin-left: 48px;"><span style="font-weight: bold;">Credits</span> - Decimal field, 99999999.99 / -99999999.99 max, no commas</p>
  <p style="margin-left: 48px;"><span style="font-weight: bold;">Description</span> - Text, no commas, 40 characters max.</p>
  <p>Column headers can be in any order.  Spelling counts but the header values are not case-sensitive.</p>
  <p>Data row values must be consistent with header rows.</p>
  <p>File can include additional columns.  All but the five noted above are ignored.</p>
  <p>Data values can be wrapped in single- or double-quotes but this is completely optional.  The import process strips them away if it sees them.</p>
  <p>Commas embedded in any of the values will cause the import to fail. This is true with or without quote wrappers.</p>
  <h3>10.3.2 GL Budget Journal - Import .CSV file</h3>
  <p>A new Import .CSV button supports the import of .csv files used to generate GL Journal Budget entries for various GL Account Id&#39;s.  When a new GL Account Id is entered or an existing budget journal is viewed for a GL Account Id and the Import .CSV icon is clicked, a browser window will be opened to a registry-defined folder to allow the user to select a .csv file to import as the GL Journal Budget child lines.  </p>
  <p>The import process includes an option that allows imported lines to APPEND to or REPLACE(default) existing child rows. The Import loads the child rows. The User is responsible for saving the transaction.</p>
  <h3>Registry:</h3>
  <p>The following registry setting is required to use this feature:  </p>
  <p>This registry setting supports the default directory path name for the CSV budget files.  </p>
  <p><strong>Id:</strong> sys-viewer-vglbdgtjrnllst</p>
  <p><strong>Setting Key:</strong> ImportFilePath   <strong>Setting Value:</strong> <em>full path</em></p>
  <p>This is the registry SAMPro uses to open for selecting the CSV files; this directory must exist. The Windows browser will open this folder when users click the Import CSV button.</p>
  <h3>CSV File Definition:</h3>
  <p>Each CSV file must contain a header row which serves as a column map.  There are six required column headers:</p>
  <p style="margin-left: 48px;"><strong>PeriodId </strong>- a valid Accounting Period Id (required)</p>
  <p style="margin-left: 48px;"><strong>GLEntityId </strong>- a valid GL Entity Id</p>
  <p style="margin-left: 48px;"><strong>Debits</strong> - Decimal field, 99999999.99 / -99999999.99 max, no commas</p>
  <p style="margin-left: 48px;"><strong>Credits</strong> - Decimal field, 99999999.99 / -99999999.99 max, no commas</p>
  <p style="margin-left: 48px;"><strong>EffectiveDate</strong> - a valid Date for the Accounting Period Id (required), formatted as YYYY-MM-DD</p>
  <p style="margin-left: 48px;"><strong>Description</strong> - Text, no commas, 40 characters max.</p>
  <p>Column headers can be in any order.  Spelling counts but the header values are not case-sensitive.</p>
  <p>Data row values must be consistent with header rows.</p>
  <p>File can include additional columns.  All but the six noted above are ignored.</p>
  <p>Data values can be wrapped in single- or double-quotes but this is completely optional.  The import process strips them away if it sees them.</p>
  <p>Commas embedded in any of the values will cause the import to fail. This is true with or without quote wrappers.  </p>
  <p><strong>Customer Note: This new import function requires separate .csv files for each GL Account Id that have different budget amounts. The same .csv import file can be re-used for multiple GL Accounts, as needed.   </strong></p>
  <h2>10.4 GL Account</h2>
  <p><span style="font-weight: bold;">New Field: GL Entity Usage Filter (SQL)</span><br/>
    Reserved for future use.</p>
  <h2>10.5 GL Entity</h2>
  <p><span style="font-weight: bold;">New Field: GL Account Usage Filter (SQL)</span><br/>
    Reserved for future use.</p>
  <h2>10.6 Bank Deposit Journal</h2>
  <p style="margin-left: 8px;"><span style="font-weight: bold;">Bank Deposit Journal Receipts Tab:</span> A new column,  “Entered By” has been added to the right the AR Sales Id. This column displays the Id of the user who recorded the Cash Receipt.</p>
  <p style="margin-left: 8px;">The &quot;Total Deposit&quot; column has been added to the Bank Deposit List views.</p>
  <p>This release expands the Bank Deposit Journal Check No. display field from 20 to 25 characters to support the AR Cash Receipts and AR History Check numbers.</p>
  <h2>10.7 GL Reporting Period</h2>
  <p>In this release, the Report Title is cleared when a GL Reporting Period is cloned: it will be set correctly based on the Fiscal Year and Date when the new record is added.</p>
  <h3>10.7.1 Intercompany Specific GL Reporting Periods</h3>
  <p><span style="font-weight: bold;">New Field: Company Id</span><br/>
    The GL Reporting Period viewer now supports optional definition of company-specific Reporting Periods to allow for differing fiscal year definitions. Any install using an Interco v.cus file will start seeing the Company Id in this viewer. The new view also exposes the Report Title field.  If left blank, this field will be &#39;built&#39; using the logic already in the viewer.</p>
  <p>Out-of-the-box, SAMPro does NOT support company-specific GL Reporting Periods.  A global registry setting is required to enable this feature.  Validation has been added to the GL Reporting Periods viewer relative to this new setting.  Absent the new setting, the user will not be permitted to save a record with a Company Id specified.</p>
  <p><span style="font-weight: bold;">Id:</span> sys-ffv-global-settings</p>
  <p><span style="font-weight: bold;">Setting Key:</span> UseCompanySpecificGLReportingPeriods  <span style="font-weight: bold;">Setting Value:</span> true</p>
  <p>If the above registry is enabled, the Company Id will be a required field in the GL Reporting Period viewer.</p>
  <p>When running a GL Report, if UseCompanySpecificGLReportingPeriods is enabled, the GL Reporting Period will now be reset if the selected Company does not match the reporting period.</p>
  <h2>10.8  Bank Reconciliation Journal</h2>
  <p>This release prevents the sporadic loss of Check lines when saving a Bank Reconciliation entry. If a problem is detected, the user will be prompted to refresh the transaction and re-make any required changes.</p>
  <h3>10.8.1 Transactions Eligible for Edit</h3>
  <p>In previous releases, validation ensured that ONLY the most recent Bank Reconciliation transaction (as established by highest TrxId per GL Bank Account / GL Entity combination) was eligible for edit. This rule did not always result in the appropriate transaction being available for edit.</p>
  <p>This release refines the edit validation so that any existing Bank Reconciliation transaction may qualify as eligible for edit, provided the edit won’t undermine or conflict with a more recent transaction.  This means that transactions may be “undone” via edit in reverse transaction id sequence in order to work backwards to address an issues in Bank Reconciliation transactions prior to just the last one posted versus previously when ONLY that last transaction posted could be edited.</p>
  <h2>10.9 Start Create GL End Of Year</h2>
  <p>While the EOY transaction is being created, the processing tallies transaction Total DB and Total CR amounts as it builds the individual lines. The difference between the two accumulated totals are posted to Retained Earnings as the last line of the transaction, thereby making for a balanced transaction. Previously, the accumulator fields were sized too small and get truncated when in excess of $99,999,999.99. In version 9.1.611.053c and up, the size of the accumulator fields has been expanded to correct this problem.</p>
  <p>If the GL Account / Entity combinations for the annual sum of Debits and/or Credits exceeds 100M, this function evaluates and parses calculations that exceed table constraints into multiple GL Journal lines to prevent truncation errors.</p>
  <p>Previously, when users would utilize the function Start Create GL End of Year, it failed to write values to &lt;glhstry&gt; posting for the values &lt;glhstry_pstd_dte&gt;,&lt;glhstry_pstd_tme&gt;, and &lt;glhstry_pstd_by&gt;. This update corrects this defect. </p>
  <h5>10.9.1 Intercompany Support for Start Create GL End of Year</h5>
  <p>Version 9.1.611.050 fully supports Intercompany Processing in this function.</p>
  <p><span style="font-weight: bold;">New Field:</span> Company Id (Interco customizations only)<br/>
    This field is displayed and required for Interco installations.  </p>
  <p><span style="font-weight: bold;">Changed Field: GL Entity (Interco customizations only)</span><br/>
    For Intercompany installations, this display-only field will default from the Balance Sheet Default in the selected Company record.<span style="font-weight: bold;"> </span></p>
  <p><span style="font-weight: bold;">Changed Range: GL Entity</span><br/>
    This range is not available for Intercompany installations.<span style="font-weight: bold;"> </span></p>
  <p style="margin-left: 48px;"><span style="font-weight: bold;">Important:</span> As of  9.1.611.050 an updated v.cus file is required for Intercompany users running Start Create PM Billing and Start Create GL End of Year; the Company Id is now a required field in these functions. <b style="mso-bidi-font-weight: normal;"><span style="font-weight: normal;"> Standard customizations are included with this image. Custom v.cus files may be obtained from Data-Basics Support.</span></b></p>
  <h2><b style="mso-bidi-font-weight: normal;">10.10  GL History</b></h2>
  <p>This release corrects an issue where just changing the Work Order Name caused a reversal and forwarding of gl and inventory history entries using the original items date effective and accounting period (even if the accounting period was closed). </p>
  <p>In previous releases, the Posted By and Date Posted fields were available to users in the filter/range screen of View GL History, however not present as columns in either List View for that particular viewer. This has been corrected, and Posted By/Date Posted are now available columns when viewing the list of GL History transactions.</p>
  <h2>10.11 Bank Transfer Journal</h2>
  <p>When in Change/Save mode, A GL Entity revision is allowed but NOT if the edit would change the Company/Security established when the journal entry was initially created. This validation should prevent Intercompany OOB Company/Security posting.</p>
  <p>This release allows cloning a Bank Transfer Journal entry with inter-company GLH activity to be handled correctly.</p>
  <p>This release corrects an issue where pressing the &#39;plus&#39; sign when entering a detail line, it would appear as 100 times it&#39;s value in the header. Detail lines inadvertently entered with a + sign are now handled correctly.</p>
  <p>Tab Mismatch functionality now ensures that the credit and debit amounts match when saving this journal.</p>
  <h2><span style="font-weight: bold;">10.12 Release Recurring GL Journal Entries</span></h2>
  <p style="margin-left: 8px;">Previously, if an &#39;auto-reversing&#39; entry was selected in the checklist, then all entries generated were reversed. Now only those flagged as Auto Reverse make reversal entries.</p>
  <h1>11 Job Scheduling - New Module</h1>
  <p style="margin-left: 48px;"><span style="font-weight: bold;">IMPORTANT:</span> As of version 9.1.611.042, access to this module is now controlled via the vrgstry.cus and vrgstry.sam files. If your firm is running this module your support representative must provide you with upgraded files. This release also corrects issues with intercompany security.</p>
  <h2>11.0 Overview</h2>
  <p class="MsoNormal">Many SAMPro Users have a Construction element to their business as well as Service.  Many Users also have technicians that do both Service and Construction work, depending on work load.  This creates a need to schedule technicians for many days on one Job, and also see all work scheduled in one place.</p>
  <p class="MsoNormal">Previously, the only way to accomplish this was to create Work Orders for each Job/Cost Code/Bill Item through New Call, and add several Technician dispatch lines; one for each technician for each scheduled date.  This would then allow traditional dispatching and TechAnywhere use. </p>
  <p class="MsoNormal">The Job Scheduling module allows Installation Work Orders to be generated from the Job&#39;s WO Creator tab (enabled via registry).  A special starter function, Start Create Job Scheduler WOs, will be enabled when this module is purchased.  It will generate the Installation Work Orders using the information provided on the Job&#39;s WO Creator Tab.</p>
  <p class="MsoNormal">In addition, there is now a Job Scheduler tool in DBAnalytics that allows ease of finding the appropriate, available technicians for each Installation Work Order and schedule for several days at once, all while tracking scheduled vs.... estimated hours.  The Job Scheduler Dispatch Board also give you a view of all work scheduled with a day, week, or two week view.</p>
  <h2>11.1 Registry</h2>
  <h3>11.1.1 Job Viewer Registry to Enable New WO Creator Tab</h3>
  <p>The following registry entry is required to make the new WO Creator tab (Scheduler child table) visible in the Job Viewer.</p>
  <p><span style="font-weight: bold;">Id:</span> sys-viewer-vjb</p>
  <p><span style="font-weight: bold;">Setting Key:</span>  ShowJobScheduler  <span style="font-weight: bold;">Setting Value:</span> true  (default is false)</p>
  <h3><span style="font-weight: bold;">11.1.2 Job Registry Option to Limit Techs Allowed on Job&#39;s WO Creator Tab</span></h3>
  <p><span style="font-weight: bold;">Id:</span> sys-viewer-vjb</p>
  <p><span style="font-weight: bold;">Setting Key:</span>  JobCreatorTechnicianFilter   <span style="font-weight: bold;">Setting Value:</span> <span style="font-style: italic;">listoftechs</span></p>
  <p>The Setting Value <span style="font-style: italic;">listoftechs</span> would be replaced by a comma separated string of Technician Ids which are allowed to be entered on the Job&#39;s WO Creator tab. This registry may be used to force Work Orders to be created for &quot;techs&quot; representing areas or groups instead of actual Technicians.  Since the Date and Hours on Work Orders created from the WO Creator tab are generally estimates, some users may not wish to immediately assign them to real Techs.</p>
  <h3>11.1.2a Job Registry to Edit Child Tabs</h3>
  <p style="margin-left: 8px;">In previous releases, the registry setting Id:  sys-viewer-vjb and setting key: childtabs the could not be reliably used because the Employee Overrides &amp; Prevailing Wages child tabs both had the same exact TabId: wages.  This resulted in display issues and an application crash when these tabs were clicked with this registry enabled.</p>
  <p style="margin-left: 8px;">In this release, the wages TabId on the &#39;Employee Overrides&#39; tab has been changed to empwages to allow the childtabs registry to be set properly. The &#39;Prevailing Wages&#39; tab retains the wages TabId.</p>

  <h2>11.2 Job Record - WO Creator Tab (New)</h2>
  <p>This tab provides a basis for scheduling personnel for construction/installation type jobs. The information in this tab will be used by Start Create Job Scheduler WOs to generate Work Orders for this Job; these Work Orders will be linked to this tab when they have been created. This Starter function is only available if this module has be implemented in your database.   </p>
  <p>When a Job is cloned, the contents of the WO Creator tab is also cloned (minus the Work Order link).</p>
  <p>When the Insert/Copy button is clicked for a lines which has the WO already assigned the WO Id will not be copied.</p>
  <p>The information on this tab, along with the Work Orders generated from it, supports a custom Job Scheduling Analytic for construction type jobs. It allows for the scheduling of workers (Technicians) for the Work Orders associated with this construction job. Since the actual scheduling is managed via Work Orders, the scheduler will also be able to view resources (Work Order Technician Tab entries) allocated to Service and PM jobs.</p>
  <p><img alt="" border="0" src="assets/images/SKIN1_CreateJobWOs.bmp" style="border: none;"/> The Job&#39;s WO Creator tab includes a button, Create Job Work Orders. Clicking this button launches the  Start Create Job Scheduler WOs function with the selected Job Id loading into the range field.</p>
  <p>One Installation Work Order will be created for each group of lines with the same Work Start date, Job Cost Code, Job Billing Item, Equipment Id and Work Code. <span style="font-size: 10.0pt; mso-bidi-font-size: 11.0pt;

  <h3>12.1.1b Registry to Specify MICR Font</h3>
  <p>Some recent versions of Troy printer drivers (and other drivers used to print MICR checks) require that a specific MICR font is specified in the SAMPro check reports. In previous versions this required a customization file to specify the font and font size. In this release, the MICR font may be specified in the registries for Payroll, Accounts Payable and PR Miscellaneous Deductions checks. The true type GnuMICR font is currently recommended for most applications.</p>
  <p style="margin-left: 48px;"><span style="font-weight: bold;">Important:</span> The MICR font must be installed in Windows on all computers checks will be run from.</p>

  <h3>12.1.2 PR Miscellaneous Deduction Checks - Double Signature</h3>
  <p>This case extends Double Signature support to MICR PRMD Checks. <span style="font-weight: bold;">A v.cus supporting a double-line form is also required for this functionality.</span>  To force a double signature line on a Miscellaneous Deduction check for amounts exceeding $10,000 (for example) use</p>

The Account is cleared if the user selects a different Company for which the registry is not set.</p>
  <p>The rules for Entity defaulting and validation are similar to the above description for GL Accounts.</p>
  <h3>12.1.2b Option to Disable the GL Entity Field (non-Intercompany installations only)</h3>
  <p><span style="font-weight: bold;">Id:</span> sys-report-rprmdchck</p>
  <p><span style="font-weight: bold;">Setting Key:</span> disabledFieldsParent    <span style="font-weight: bold;">Setting Value:</span> <span style="font-style: italic;">glentty.id</span></p>
  <p>This option is designed to prevent the GL Entity from being inadvertently entered for non-Intercompany SAMPro installations. It should only be enabled if the GL Entity should NEVER be entered when printing this type of check.</p>
  <h3><span>12.1.2c Registry To Specify MICR Font</span></h3>
  <p>Some recent versions of Troy printer drivers (and other drivers used to print MICR checks) require that a specific MICR font is specified in the SAMPro check reports. In previous versions this required a customization file to specify the font and font size.

  <h3>12.1.3 Registry to Use Employee Entity for Earnings Not Costed</h3>
  <p>The Salaries DB Entity is typically supplied by the Cost Code. In some scenarios, it may be desirable to have the Entity come from the Employee when available.</p>
  <p>When the following registry setting is implemented, the Employee&#39;s GL Entity is used as the Debit Entity (if not overridden by the Earnings Record) for ALL earnings that have both Job Cost Labor Entry and Job Cost PR Check set to false. Note that the Debit GL Entity from the Earnings record (if completed) still has the highest priority, with or without the registry.</p>
  <p><span style="font-weight: bold;">Id:</span> sys-ffv-global-settings</p>
  <p><span style="font-weight: bold;">Setting Key:</span> UseEmployeeEntityForEarningsNotCosted   <span style="font-weight: bold;">Setting Value:</span> true</p>
  <p><span style="font-weight: bold;">WARNING:</span> the new registry option &#39;UseEmployeeEntityForEarningsNotCosted&#39; has different behaviors for the DB and CR sides. Hierarchy is as follows:</p>
  <p style="margin-left: 48px;"> DB without new setting ... Earnings DB Entity, Cost Code Entity, Employee Entity</p>
  <p style="margin-left: 48px;"> DB with new setting    ... Earnings DB Entity, Employee Entity, Cost Code Entity</p>
  <p style="margin-left: 48px;"> CR without new setting ... Employee Entity, Earnings CR Entity</p>
  <p style="margin-left: 48px;"> CR with new setting    ... Earnings CR Entity, Employee Entity</p>
  <h3>12.1.4 Burden Allocation for Overhead Labor</h3>
  <p>This release implements an option to accrue burden for overhead labor without forcing Burden GL to use Wage GL. This enables Burden allocations on time charged to indirect jobs.</p>
  <p><span style="font-weight: bold;">Id:</span> sys-ffv-global-settings</p>
  <p><span style="font-weight: bold;">Setting Key:</span> AccrueBurdenCostForOverheadLabor   Setting Value: true</p>
  <p style="margin-left: 48px;"><span style="font-weight: bold;">Note:</span><br/>
    The ReclassifyBurdenCostForOverheadLabor option is similar but set the Burden GL equal to the Wage GL when the accruing the burden. AccrueBurdenCostForOverheadLabor allows the Burden GL to stay as specified in the accrual.</p>
  <p style="font-weight: bold; margin-left: 48px;">Configuration Note:</p>
  <p style="margin-left: 48px;">If both Global Settings option AccrueBurdenCostForOverheadLabor and  UseEmployeeEntityForEarningsNotCosted  are set to true, configuring Standard Cost Earnings records so that the GL Debit and GL Credit point to the same account leads to a net zero GL effect when standard costs are charged to overhead jobs.</p>
  <h3>12.1.5 Registry to Match Job Cost / GL Accrual of Labor</h3>
  <p>The registry fixes known labor costing issues where the dollars posted to GL Cost-of-Sales and JCH do not match. When enabled, is acts as a comprehensive calculator for Labor Pay Rates, Job Cost Rates and GL Accruals, impacting payroll calculations in the Labor Journal, WO Labor, WO Entry, the Employee Rate Test tab, and Start Compute Payroll.</p>
  <p><span style="font-weight: bold;">Id:</span> sys-ffv-global-settings</p>
  <p><span style="font-weight: bold;">Setting Key:</span>  LaborRatesAndAccrualMethod  <span style="font-weight: bold;">Setting Value:</span> 7687</p>
  <p style="margin-left: 48px;"><span style="font-weight: bold;">IMPORTANT NOTE:</span> We strongly recommend discussing this option with your support rep AND running tests with this registry enabled BEFORE turning it on in your live system. In general, this option should make posting more accurate, but it may be impacted by the customer&#39;s specific configuration. The new Select Rate Method to Test field on the Employee Rate Test tab will help with initial testing (Customer Note 12.5.2).</p>
  <p style="margin-left: 8px;"><span style="font-weight: bold;">Employee Viewer Rate Test Tab:</span><br/>
    <span style="font-weight: bold;">New Field: Select Rate Method to Test</span><br/>
    By default, the Rate Method will be set to configuration currently in use (see table below). Switching to a different Method resets the Rate Test Tab to the values which would be obtained if that method were in effect.

  <h5>12.1.10a Standard Cost as a Percent of Wages</h5>
  <p>By default, when a Standard Cost - % based Earnings Id is defined, it&#39;s &quot;cost basis&quot; logic is limited to evaluating only other &quot;hourly&quot; based standard cost earning<i>s </i>in context. The very existence of an in context <em>standard cost </em>earnings id will cause all % based burden calculations to ignore &quot;wage&quot; as a basis and use &quot;standard cost&quot; as it&#39;s basis.</p>
  <p>When the following registry is in effect any percent Earnings Id (ex. burden) will be calculated from the Wage Earning id as opposed to the Standard Cost Earnings Id. It allows users to take advantage of the GL structure of standard cost while having job costing still include the actual wage.  </p>
  <p>a.) Burden% computation will ignore the presence of &quot;standard cost&quot; earnings id in context (and compute as it currently does in absence thereof).</p>
  <p>b.) Standard% computation will use the same &quot;basis&quot; as (a.)  which is wages inclusive of PW overrides.</p>

  <h3>12.1.11 Registry to Specify Exceptions to Taxable Fringes</h3>
  <p>This release implements registry-controlled refinements for the Earnings record&#39;s Taxable flag. This lets you specify that tax for certain specified Authorities or Groups should NOT be assessed for a Taxable fringe. The User1 and User2 fields of the Earnings Record are used to specify which taxes to exclude. The following registries are required to enable this functionality.</p>
  <p><span style="font-weight: bold;">Id:</span> sys-compute-payroll</p>
  <p><span style="font-weight: bold;">Setting Key:</span>  FringeTaxExceptionUser1  <span style="font-weight: bold;">Setting Value:</span> TaxAuthorityId  </p>
  <p><span style="font-weight: bold;">Setting Key:</span>  FringeTaxExceptionUser2  <span style="font-weight: bold;">Setting Value:</span> TaxTableId</p>
  <p>(Note: the Setting Values of TaxTableId or TaxAuthorityId can be used with either of the above setting keys.)</p>
  <p>If either or both of these registries are enabled, Compute Payroll checks the User 1 and/or User 2 fields of the Earnings Record to see if there are any Taxable Fringes should NOT be taxed by the listed Tax Authorities or Tax Tables. Note that this ONLY works for Tax Tables specified as &#39;Always Withhold&#39; on the Employee&#39;s taxes tab.</p>
  <p style="font-weight: bold;">Earnings Record:</p>
  <p><span style="font-weight: bold;">Changed Fields: Earnings User1 - Earnings User2</span><br/>
    These fields may be used to specify a list of Tax Groups or Tax Authorities for which tax should NOT be assessed if enabled via the above registry setting:</p>
  <p style="margin-left: 48px;">If the Earning Record is of Type Fringe, with the Taxable box checked AND  <br/>
    The FringeTaxExceptionsUser1 or FringeTaxExceptionsUser2 registries are set AND<br/>
    The Tax Table is specified as &#39;Always Withhold&#39; on the Employee&#39;s taxes tab.</p>
  <h3>12.1.11a Compute Payroll - Additional &#39;Other Taxes&#39;</h3>
  <p>This registry-enabled enhancement was implemented to support a client implementing payroll with employees that cover: CT, MA &amp; RI. RI and MA have &quot;other taxes&quot; and MA most particularly has several.  There is no apparent employee &quot;home-based&quot; reciprocity between the states, so job contextual Tax Authority determination is necessary...but we only support a SINGLE &quot;other&quot; tax authority per job.</p>
  <p>This release supports a registry based setting to designate a Job User field to serve as container for holding additional Tax Authorities to be evaluated during Payroll Compute to implement additional job-specific other taxes when the employee is doing &#39;field&#39; work at the job site.</p>
  <p><span style="font-weight: bold;">Registry Id:</span> sys-compute-payroll</p>
  <p><span style="font-weight: bold;">Setting Key:</span> AdditionalTaxesJobUserField</p>
  <p><span style="font-weight: bold;">Setting Value:</span> 1-10 (identifies jb_usr field)</p>
  <p>The Job User Field identified in the Setting Value must include a comma-delimited list of additional &#39;other&#39; Tax Authority Ids to be used when an employee does work at that site.</p>
  <p><span style="font-weight: bold;">NOTE:</span> Report PR Export does NOT support additional other taxes.</p>
  <p><span style="font-weight: bold;">NOTE:</span> Field/Office determination in Compute PR does NOT apply to the separate State/Local/Other Tax Authorities stored in the Job record.  That determination is made in the LJ and WO viewers and the results are stored in the appropriate JCH columns.  Compute PR then uses whatever has been stored in JCH without concern for how/why the values were set.</p>
  <h3>12.1.11b Compute Payroll - Allow Negative Tax</h3>
  <p>This release refines Compute Payroll processing to allow for negative earnings AND negative taxes (except for annualized taxes e.g. federal &amp; state tables) when the following existing registry is set:</p>
  <p><span style="font-weight: bold;">Id:</span> sys-compute-payroll</p>
  <p><span style="font-weight: bold;">Setting Key:</span> AllowNegativeTax  <span style="font-weight: bold;">Setting Value:</span> true</p>
  <p>Local Taxes are applicable by Job Location and designated in Job record. This new functionality allows time coded to the wrong Job in a prior Payroll Period to be corrected so that the Local or Other Tax allocation is correct.</p>
  <p style="margin-left: 48px;"><span style="font-weight: bold;">Important:</span>  This release does not allow negative tax for tables that use annualized calculations (e.g., Federal &amp; State Taxes).   This registry setting is not needed for the compute function to calculate minus taxable earnings or minus tax (as needed) on tables with annual limits (e.g. FUTA,SUTA).</p>
  <h3>12.1.12 Custom PR ADP Export</h3>
  <p>This release addresses a problem with the option format ADPKaback. The conflict using the PRS Reimb Code in Other Rate records for PR Export processing in conjunction with TechAnywhere has been resolved.</p>
  <p>This release also supports earnings 3 code ADC (Additional Compensation).</p>
  <p>This new format provides a customized ADP detail record generated by the Report PR Export function. This new processing will be enabled via the following registry options and entries in the Employee User2 field and with consultation with ADP.</p>
  <p><span style="font-weight: bold;">Id:</span> sys-pr-export</p>
  <p><span style="font-weight: bold;">Setting Key:</span> format   <span style="font-weight: bold;">Setting Value:</span> ADPKaback</p>
  <p><span style="font-weight: bold;">Setting Key</span> TaxFrequencyField   <span style="font-weight: bold;">Setting Value:</span> emplye_usr2</p>
  <p style="margin-left: 48px;"><span style="font-weight: bold;">Note:</span> If the ADPKaback format is specified, the FileId, PathName and CompanyCode keys must also be completed in the registry. The AltEmployeeIDField key is supported. It is optional  and if the key is not present, the emplye_id field is used.</p>
  <p style="font-weight: bold;">Employee Record</p>
  <p>The Employee User2 field must be set to the appropriate TaxFrequency value. This value will be included in the ADP export detail for the ADPKaback format.</p>
  <h3>12.1.12a Option to Override Pay # by Employee (ADPKaback)</h3>
  <p>Version 9.1.611.052 supports miscellaneous modifications to the custom ADPKaback format for ADP reporting.</p>
  <p>The following registry setting may be used to override the Pay # in the PR Export file <span style="font-weight: bold;">for the ADPKaback format only</span>:</p>
  <p><span style="font-weight: bold;">Id:</span> sys-pr-export</p>
  <p><span style="font-weight: bold;">Setting Key:</span> PayNumberField    <span style="font-weight: bold;">Setting Value:</span> emplye_usr3</p>
  <p>For example, entering a 0 (zero) in emplye_usr3 field would force a blank to be printed in the Pay# field in the export file.</p>
  <h3>12.1.13  Custom PR Export Paychex Mod</h3>
  <p>The following changes were made to the custom Paychex format PayChexDayNite:</p>
  <p style="margin-left: 48px;">Extract the new PayChex Employee # (Employee User1 field) into Employee Id, positions 1-6<br/>
    Do not extract the SS# into positions 119-128, leave blank.</p>
  <h3>12.1.14  Report PR Export - Paychex SPI Flex Format</h3>
  <p>The Report PR Export function now supports the Paychex SPI Flex Format. The following registry is required to enable this functionality.</p>
  <p><span style="font-weight: bold;">Id:</span> sys-pr-export</p>
  <p><span style="font-weight: bold;">Setting Key:</span> format <span style="font-weight: bold;"> Setting Value:</span> PaychexSPI</p>
  <p>This setting specifies that the Paychex SPI Flex format will be exported. If this setting is enabled, the Paychex format setting should not be enabled!</p>

  <p>This required setting specifies the client number assigned to your firm by Paychex. It will be used to generate part of the filename of the Paychex file.</p>
  <h3>12.1.14a Report PR Export (Prime Pay)</h3>
  <p>The Report PR Export function now supports exports to Prime Pay. The following registry is required to implement the Prime Pay format in the generated text file.</p>
  <p><span style="font-weight: bold;">Id:</span> sys-pr-export</p>
  <p>
    <font style="font-weight: bold;">Setting Key:</font> Format <font style="font-weight: bold;">Setting Value:</font> PrimePay
  </p>
  <p>This required setting specifies that the PrimePay formatting will be used in the Report Payroll Export function.</p>
  <p>
    <font style="font-weight: bold;">Setting Key:</font> PathName <font style="font-weight: bold;">Setting Value:</font>
    <font style="font-style: italic;">path</font>
  </p>
  <p>This registry option specifies the complete path of the directory to which SAMPro will export the PrimePay file.</p>
  <h3>12.1.14b Report PR Export (Canadian ADP Processing)</h3>
  <p>This release supports Canadian ADP processing. A revised Canadian v.cus is needed. The following registry settings are required to enable this functionality.</p>
  <p><span style="font-weight: bold;">Id:</span> sys-pr-export</p>
  <p>
    <font style="font-weight: bold;">Setting Key:</font> Format <font style="font-weight: bold;">Setting Value:</font> ADPCanada
  </p>

    <font style="font-style: italic;">path</font>
  </p>
  <p>This registry option specifies the complete path of the directory to which SAMPro will export the Canadian ADP export file.</p>
  <p><span style="font-weight: bold;">Setting Key:</span> CompanyCodeCA   <span style="font-weight: bold;">Setting Value:</span> 2-3 character code specified by ADP</p>
  <p>This is also a field on the input screen.  If the CompanyCodeCA is set in the Registry, it will automatically default into report range screen.</p>
  <p><span style="font-weight: bold;">Setting Key:</span> AltEmployeeIDField   <span style="font-weight: bold;">Setting Value:</span> <span style="font-style: italic;">database employee field with alternate id</span></p>

  <p><span style="font-weight: bold;">
      <font style="font-weight: bold;">S</font>etting Key:
    </span> FileId   <span style="font-weight: bold;">Setting Value:</span>
    <font style="font-style: italic;">YY</font>
  </p>
  <p>
    <font style="font-style: italic;">YY</font> should be replaced by a 1-2 character code used to generate the filename. This is also a field on the input screen. If the FileId is set in the Registry, it will automatically default into the report range screen.
  </p>
  <h3>12.1.14c Report PR Export - Paycor Format</h3>
  <p>The following registry may be used to modify the Report PR Export function when using the Paycor format. When implemented, the Employee User field indicated by the Setting Value will be used to specify the Employee Id in the export file.</p>

  <p>This registry option specifies the complete path of the directory to which SAMPro will export the GMS file.</p>
  <h3>12.1.15 Labor Journal Registry to Use Default Service Job in the Equipment record for all but PM WO’s</h3>
  <p>
    <font style="font-weight: bold;">Registry Id: <span style="font-weight: normal;">sys-viewer-</span></font>vlbrjrnl
  </p>
  <p>
    <font style="font-weight: bold;">Setting Key:</font> DefaultJobByEquipmentId <font style="font-weight: bold;">Setting Value:</font> true
  </p>
  <p>By default, the system uses the Job in the Work Order header as the default job for entering WO-related detail in the Labor Journal. This release supports the above registry setting to alter this behavior. If this registry entry is enabled (and the referenced WO is NOT preventative maintenance), the system will check to see if there is a default service job in the equipment header. If so, the Job, Cost Code and Billing item to the from the Equipment will be defaulted instead of from the WO header. If the job info is blank in the equipment record, the system uses the job info in the work order header.</p>
  <p>The TechAnywhere Labor Post also follows this registry.</p>
  <p>For Preventive Maintenance Work Orders, Job information defaults from the WO header, regardless of whether or not this registry entry is enabled.</p>
  <p>Note: registry options to provide this functionality is also available in the Work Order, AP Journal and Purchase Order registries. A separate registry will be provided to support this functionality in TechAnywhere posts to the Labor Journal in a future release.</p>
  <h3>12.1.15a Labor Journal Registry Setting To Require Work Order for Service Compute Jobs</h3>
  <p>Jobs indicated as &quot;Service Compute&quot; get billed by the Work Order, yet we allow costs to be entered and posted to Jobs w/o reference to any specific work order, leaving these unbilled costs in limbo. This feature may be activated to warn or error if a Work Order is not specified for Jobs flagged as &#39;Service Compute&#39; when manual entries are recorded. Tests are ignored on lines imported from TechAnywhere / TimeAnywhere.</p>
  <p style="margin-left: 48px;"><span style="font-weight: bold;">Note:</span> This setting may also be made globally in the sys-ffv-global-settings registry. If so, the local setting by Journal will trump the global entry.</p>
  <p><span style="font-weight: bold;">Registry Id:</span> sys-viewer-vlbrjrnl</p>
  <p><span style="font-weight: bold;">Setting Key:</span> NeedWOInServiceComputeJobs  <span style="font-weight: bold;">Setting Value: </span>Error, Warning or Neither (default Neither)</p>
  <p><span style="font-weight: bold;">W</span>hen the Setting Value is set to <span style="font-weight: bold;">Error</span>, the user will be alerted when leaving a line lacking a Work Order Id and will not be able to save the record. Note that implementing Error on an existing system impacts your ability to edit existing entries. It should be implemented with caution.</p>
  <p>When <span style="font-weight: bold;">Warning</span> is implemented, the user will be alerted when leaving a line lacking a Work Order Id but will be able to save the record.</p>
  <p>If <span style="font-weight: bold;">Neither</span> is implemented (or the registry option does not exist) the user will not be alerted if a Service Compute type Job lacks a Work Order reference.</p>
  <h3>12.1.15b Labor Journal Registry to Control Recurring Labor Earnings and Deduction Groups</h3>
  <p>The Employee Recurring Wages tab includes Earnings Group and Deduction Group fields in the detail view. However, when the Recurring Labor is posted, the system uses the Earning and Deduction Groups from the Employee Defaults tab by default.</p>
  <p>This release supports a registry-controlled emulation for including Earnings and Deduction Groups from the Employee Recurring Wages tab for Recurring Labor entries. The current behavior (only set the Earnings and Deduction Groups from the Employee Record) is maintained in the absence of the following registries.</p>
  <p>
    <font style="font-weight: bold;">Registry Id: </font>sys-viewer-vlbrjrnl   <span style="font-weight: bold;">Registry Name:</span> View Labor Journal

  <h3>12.1.16 Registries to Sort Earnings / Deductions By End Date in Employee, Earnings Group and Deductions Group Viewers</h3>
  <p>In previous releases of version 9.1, the Employee&#39;s Earnings and Deductions group tabs, and the Earnings Group and Deduction Group child tabs were automatically sorted in descending order by the End Date of each child line. Due to issues maintaining complex Earnings and Deduction Groups, the default behavior has been changed back so that the lines are NOT resorted when the record is saved. If you wish to have the child lines sorted, the following registry settings(s) must be implemented:</p>
  <p><span style="font-weight: bold;">Id:</span> sys-viewer-vernngsgrp (Earnings Group)</p>
  <p><span style="font-weight: bold;">Setting Key:</span> NoSortOnChildren  <span style="font-weight: bold;">Setting Value:</span> false (default is true to prevent sorting)</p>
  <p><span style="font-weight: bold;">Id:</span> sys-viewer-vddctngrp (Deduction Group)</p>
  <p><span style="font-weight: bold;">Setting Key:</span> NoSortOnChildren  <span style="font-weight: bold;">Setting Value:</span> false (default is true to prevent sorting)</p>
  <p><span style="font-weight: bold;">Id:</span> sys-viewer-vemplye   (Employee - Earnings and Deductions Tabs)</p>
  <p><span style="font-weight: bold;">Setting Key:</span> NoSortOnChildren  <span style="font-weight: bold;">Setting Value:</span> false (default is true to prevent sorting)</p>
  <h3>12.1.17 Registry to Force Earnings Credit GL Entity to Always Follow Debit GL Entity on PR Accruals</h3>
  <p><span style="font-weight: bold;">Registry Id:</span> sys-ffv-global-settings</p>
  <p><span style="font-weight: bold;">Setting Key:</span>  PRAccrualGLEntityMatch <span style="font-weight: bold;">Setting Value:</span> true (default false)</p>
  <p>When this registry is enabled, the Earnings Credit/Debit will always be the same for PR-to-GL accruals. When enabled, the credit side GL Entity of an Earnings ID will follow the same GL Entity used by the Debit (instead of using the GL Entity on the Employee record).</p>
  <p style="margin-left: 48px;">WARNING: this registry should not be implemented if you are using Intercompany and the Employees are being paid out of a Company that is NOT related to the Jobs they work on.</p>
  <h3>12.1.18 Registry To Use Control Records&#39; GL Entities for PR Deductions, Earnings, Taxes, etc.</h3>
  <p>This registry provides optional control over the use of the Employee GL Entity specified on the Employee record&#39;s Other tab. By default, the Employee record&#39;s GL Entity is used as the primary source when Compute Payroll is run. The GL Entity in the Payroll Tax Authority, Deductions, Earnings or Worker&#39;s Company records provide a secondary source for the GL Entity if the GL Entity is blank in the Employee record.</p>
  <p>The following registry reverses the default behavior, using the Employee&#39;s GL Entity as the secondary source and the control record&#39;s (Payroll Tax Authority, Deductions, Earnings, Worker&#39;s Comp or Other Rates operating as payroll Reimbursement codes) GL Entity as the primary source of the GL Entity.</p>
  <p><span style="font-weight: bold;">Id:</span> sys-ffv-global-settings</p>
  <p><span style="font-weight: bold;">Setting Key:</span> EmployeeGLEntityPayrollToGLH  <span style="font-weight: bold;">Setting Value:</span> secondary</p>
  <h3>12.1.19 Registry to Modify Setting of Employee PDF PINs</h3>
  <p>The option for password protecting an Employee&#39;s PR Check, PR Check Detail, and Employee Timesheet reports (SectionPasswordProtect=true) is specified in the report registry and uses the last 6 digits of the Employee&#39;s SSN or SIN as the password. This release supports the ability to modify how the PIN is generated. The original default behavior (last 6 digits of SS#) will be used if new registry entry is not enabled.</p>
  <p>The following registry modifies the behavior of the SectionPasswordProtect registry option in the report registries to use an SQL statement to define how the PIN # will be created from fields in the Employee record. The following entry uses the last 4 digits of SS#  followed by the first character of the employee&#39;s first and last name.</p>
  <p><span style="font-weight: bold;">Id:</span> sys-behavior-EmployeePin  </p>
  <p><span style="font-weight: bold;">Setting Key:</span> SQL  </p>
  <p><span style="font-weight: bold;">Setting Value:</span> RIGHT(emplye_scl_scrty_nmbr,4) + LEFT(emplye_nme_frst,1) + LEFT(emplye_nme_lst,1)</p>
  <p>Note: Other correctly configured SQL statement may be used to set the Employee PIN.  Note that this registry currently impacts PR Check, PR Check Detail, and Employee Timesheet reports that are saved as password-protect PDF&#39;s.</p>
  <h3>12.1.20 Compute Payroll - MCAD High Earners</h3>
  <p>This release provides a registry to refine the calculations used to handle pre-tax deductions (section 125, AFLAC pretax, etc) the user to setup an MCAD Tax Table that could be referenced on the Taxes tab of the Employee record, eliminating the need to enable the employee&#39;s Always Withhold flag in advance as the $200,000 limit approaches and disable it at the beginning of the year. See Customer Notes 12.19 for instructions on configuring your data to support this enhanced behavior.</p>
  <h3>12.1.21 Compute Overtime: <span style="font-weight: bold;">Registry Option to Calculate Overtime by Day / Payroll Period</span></h3>

  <p><span style="font-style: italic;">ValidOHCostCodeId</span> must reference the Job Cost Code Id (belonging to the Overhead Job referenced in the previous entry) to be used when Overtime entries are generated this function.</p>
  <p>Note that if the Job Cost Code Id is the same for all overhead jobs, it may be specified in the base sys-start-scmpteovrtme.</p>
  <p style="font-weight: bold;">Existing Compute Payroll Registry Entries Required to Support Compute Overtime</p>
  <p><span style="font-weight: bold;">Id:</span> sys-compute-payroll</p>
  <p><span style="font-weight: bold;">Setting Key:</span>  AllocateOTPremium    <span style="font-weight: bold;">Setting Value:</span> true  </p>

  <h3>12.1.21a Compute OT - Registry to Override RegPayTypeId and OTPayTypeId</h3>
  <p><span style="font-weight: bold;">Registry Id:</span>   sys-start-scmpteovrtme</p>
  <p><span style="font-weight: bold;">Setting Key:</span> UseEmployeePayTypes  <span style="font-weight: bold;">Setting Value:</span> true  (default false)</p>
  <p>With the above registry in place, the Employee Record provides overrides for the RegPayTypeId and OTPayTypeId settings. The decision to the Employee&#39;s Direct Pay or Indirect Pay defaults is based on the Job. If the Job is tagged as Overhead, the Indirect defaults are used. The Employee Direct Pay default are used if the Job is not Overhead.</p>
  <h3><span style="font-weight: bold;">12.1.22 Designate PR Period to be Standard Cost Only</span></h3>
  <p>Version 9.1.611.058 supports a method to designate specific PR Periods as evaluating only Earnings Ids types &quot;Standard Cost&quot; during Labor/WO Labor post. Labor posted to these periods would never be processed for Payroll and all earnings ids that are not Standard Cost will be ignored for JCH / GLH posting by the Journal. This provides a way to post JobCost Only labor (Standard Cost) entries within an installation where actual Payroll (Wage, Fringe, Burden) will also be entered and processed.</p>
  <p>The following registry and Payroll Period setup are both required.</p>
  <p><span style="font-weight: bold;">Registry Id:</span> sys-ffv-global-settings</p>
  <p><span style="font-weight: bold;">Setting Key:</span> PostStandardCostEarningsOnly</p>
  <p><span style="font-weight: bold;">Setting Value:</span> pyrllprd_usr1 (or pyrllprd_usr2)</p>
  <p><span style="font-weight: bold;">Payroll Period Setup</span><br/>
    To implement the above registry and functionality, Payroll User1 or 2 must be set to true. If the Pay User 1 or 2 is field is false or blank the Payroll Period will NOT be handled as Standard Cost Only .</p>
  <p><span style="font-weight: bold;">IMPORTANT:</span> Payroll Periods for Standard Costing should NEVER be set as the Default Payroll Period.</p>
  <h2>12.2 Payroll Reports</h2>
  <h3>12.2.1 Print PR Checks</h3>
  <p style="margin-left: 8px;">*VOID* is once again printed in the signature field for non-MICR direct deposit checks. This corrects an issue in recent releases.</p>
  <p style="margin-left: 8px;">Modified print of EFT checks to only print 1 Void line on 1st signature line of MICR checks.</p>
  <p>This release corrects an issue in the PR Check stub where the Amount field was missing the leading digit.  </p>
  <p>Print PR Checks supports the Hard Block Branch logic (implemented by the global registry  BranchFilterWithHardBlock option) in this version.  The Hard Block on Branches is maintained regardless of how the Branch filter range is set.</p>
  <p style="font-weight: bold;">New Field - Check Print:  All Checks - Physical Checks - EFT Checks<br/>
    <span style="font-weight: normal;">This field may be used to separate EFT and Physical Checks. The All Checks option prints both Physical and EFT checks.  Select Physical Checks to only print live checks, or  EFT Checks to live the run to EFT&#39;s.</span>
  </p>
  <h3>12.2.1a Bonus Payroll Checks - Preferred Method for Version 9.0 and Up</h3>
  <p style="margin-left: 8px;">The new Federal Tax Rate and State Tax Rate overrides on the Labor Journal Hours Tab Detail allow large Bonus Checks to be generated without the need change the Employee Record&#39;s Taxes tab. See Customer Note 12.17.4 for additional information on using the new fields.</p>
  <p>1. Establish a new PAYROLL PERIOD for bonus checks. Example: 2017-Sept-B.</p>
  <p style="margin-left: 36.00pt; border-top: 0.50pt solid #000000; border-bottom: 0.50pt solid #000000; 
	 border-left: 0.50pt solid #000000; border-right: 0.50pt solid #000000;">
    <font style="font-weight: bold;">Note:  </font><span>Unless overridden via registry,</span>
    <font style="font-weight: bold;">BONUS</font> amounts (entered on the Labor Journal) will <font style="font-weight: bold;">NOT</font> Accrue/post to the GL, regardless of how the Accrue to GL field is checked in the Payroll Period.
  </p>
  <p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"> </p>
  <p style="margin-left: 36.00pt; border-top: 0.50pt solid #000000; border-bottom: 0.50pt solid #000000; 
	 border-left: 0.50pt solid #000000; border-right: 0.50pt solid #000000;">
    <font style="font-weight: bold;">Note: PTO Accrual and Bonus Pay Periods</font><br/>
    Typically, PTO Hours would not be accrued on bonus payroll periods. Do NOT check the Accrue PTO or the Remote Technician Applet boxes on you Bonus Payroll Period.
  </p>
  <p>2. Establish a new PAY TYPE if one doesn&#39;t already exist.</p>
  <p style="margin-left: 48px;"><span style="font-weight: bold;">Pay Type Id:</span>  Bonus  <span style="font-weight: bold;">Description:</span>  Bonus    <span style="font-weight: bold;">Check Label:</span>  Bonus </p>
  <p style="margin-left: 48px;"><span style="font-weight: bold;">Rate Factor:</span>  1.000    <span style="font-weight: bold;">Show Rate on CK:</span> optional</p>
  <p style="margin-left: 48px;"><span style="font-weight: bold;">Hours Type:</span>  Other     <span style="font-weight: bold;">GL Acct Id:</span>  GL for Wages or Bonus Wages</p>
  <p style="margin-left: 48px;"><span style="font-weight: bold;">Earnings Grp Id:</span>  n/a</p>
  <p>3. In the LABOR JOURNAL, enter all bonus amounts using the new bonus Pay Period Id setup in step 1 above (example: 2017-Sept-B).</p>
  <p>After inputting zero hours to an overhead Job and your Bonus Pay Type, double click on the MAGNIFY GLASS of the line. Confirm and edit as follows:</p>
  <p style="margin-left: 48px;"><span style="font-weight: bold;">Hours:</span>   000.00</p>
  <p style="margin-left: 48px;"><span style="font-weight: bold;">Salary?</span>  (not checked)</p>
  <p style="margin-left: 48px;"><span style="font-weight: bold;">Extra?</span>   (not checked)</p>
  <p style="margin-left: 48px;"><span style="font-weight: bold;">Pay Type Id:</span>  Bonus</p>
  <p style="margin-left: 48px;"><span style="font-weight: bold;">Bonus Amount:</span>  Enter Bonus Dollars to Pay this Employee</p>
  <p style="font-weight: bold; margin-left: 48px;">Federal Tax Rate:<br/>
    State Tax Rate:<br/>
    <span style="font-weight: normal;">These fields provide a flat rate override to the Federal / State Income Tax rate brackets in the Employee&#39;s Federal (FED-M or FED-S) and State Tax Tables. These fields are intended to be used for Bonus pay only. If these field are blank, the Federal / State Tax Table will be used as before.</span> <span style="font-weight: normal;">Enter the appropriate rate for bonuses prescribed by the tax authority.</span>
  </p>
  <p style="font-weight: bold; margin-left: 88px;">Important Notes On Usage:</p>
  <p style="margin-left: 88px;">1. The overriding federal and/or state tax rates are applied directly to the Bonus Amount with which they are associated.  Taxable wage reductions (125, 401k, etc) are NOT applied to the Bonus Amount before computing FIT/SIT using the special tax rates. Tax is on Total Earnings when using this option. If this is not desired, the old methodology of changing the Employee record&#39;s Tax tab to specify a flat tax FED-bonus entry may be used instead.</p>
  <p style="margin-left: 88px;">2. Taxable wage reductions will eventually reduce the Taxable Wages so payroll reports, including W2s, will have the correct info.</p>
  <p style="margin-left: 88px;">Consider the example where an employee received a $10,000 bonus with 20% special FIT tax rate, 10% special SIT tax rate and 5% 401k deduction.  In the event special tax rates have been specified, the following is the order in which the calculations occur:</p>
  <p style="margin-left: 128px;">Gross Wages = $10,000</p>
  <p style="margin-left: 128px;">FIT = $2,000 (10,000 x .2)</p>
  <p style="margin-left: 128px;">SIT = $1,000 (10,000 x .1)</p>
  <p style="margin-left: 128px;">401k = $500 (10,000 x .05)</p>
  <p style="margin-left: 128px;">Taxable Wage = $9,500 (10,000 - 500)</p>
  <p>4. Run the COMPUTE PAYROLL function for the new bonus Pay Period Id and the print the PAYROLL WORKSHEET before printing your checks to confirm your bonus checks are correct for the new bonus Pay Period Id.</p>
  <p style="margin-left: 48px;"><span style="font-weight: bold;">Tip:</span> Use Pay/Deduct Cycle Code XXXX to skip all deductions!</p>
  <h3>12.2.2  Print PR Miscellaneous Deduction Checks</h3>
  <p style="margin-left: 8px;"><span style="font-weight: bold;">C</span>orrects extraneous printing of &#39;Void&#39; on 2nd signature line.</p>
  <p>This release corrects an issue on checks grouped by Vendor; the total is now correctly printed according to the detail lines on check.</p>
  <p>This report supports the Hard Block logic (implemented by the BranchFilterWithHardBlock global settings registry option) in this version.  The Hard Block is maintained regardless of how the Branch filter range is set.</p>
  <h5>12.2.2a  PR Miscellaneous Deduction Checks - GL Entities</h5>
  <p>This release supports GL Debit and Credit posting for Deductions withholding (PR Check) &amp; relief (PRMD Check) using the following GL Entity posting precedence:</p>
  <p>1. As per Employee GL Entity reference if present, else</p>
  <p>2. As per Deduction Code GL Entity reference if present, else</p>
  <p>3. As per Respective Check processing &quot;Bank &quot; GL Entity referenced</p>
  <h3>12.2.3  Revised Report Payroll Worksheet</h3>
  <p style="font-weight: bold;">New Option: Include Dir Deposit Section?<br/>
    <span style="font-weight: normal;">The revised Report Payroll Worksheet (RPRWRKSv90b001.rpt) dated 2017-11-14  includes a Direct Deposit section which is enabled by checking this option. For employees with no check issued for the pay period, the section will show the appropriate info from the Direct Deposits tab in the Employee record. For employees with a check issued for the pay period, the report will show direct deposit info from the check table.</span>
  </p>
  <p style="font-weight: normal;">This report also includes the Branch Id as a filter, and supports the Hard Block logic (implemented by the BranchFilterWithHardBlock global settings registry option) on the report.  Note that report filters will not display the User&#39;s branch filters but the Hard Block is handled by the report.  </p>
  <h3>12.2.4 Executive PR Processing - Revised Reports to Install</h3>
  <p style="margin-left: 8px;">Executive PR processing has been added to the following reports via the following filter:</p>
  <p style="margin-left: 8px;"><span style="font-weight: bold;">New Filter - Executive PR:</span><br/>

  <h3>12.2.10 Report W-2 Forms</h3>
  <p>The 4-up options of BC2, 1x4 &amp; Dx4 have been removed. These options were previously deprecated due to alignment issues.  </p>
  <p>The release modifies the logic to skip print of Local Line 2 in Copy 2 or all copies of the W2 (registry enabled) so that line 1 taxes are displayed correctly.</p>
  <p>The W2 Year is now printed below the Copy label on the Plain Paper Copy version of the report.</p>
  <h3>12.2.10a W2s / W3s - Intercompany - Change to Default Behavior</h3>
  <p>If Intercompany processing is enabled then the following W2 Employer Info will now come from the appropriate Company records, NOT the registries:</p>
  <p>Company Name<br/>
    Company Address<br/>
    Company Federal EIN</p>
  <p>In previous releases, it was necessary for Intercompany users to generate multiple registries to support this information: companyname-securityid, companyaddress-securityid, companyfederalEIN-securityid.</p>
  <h3>12.2.10b - Report PR W2&#39;s / Report PR W2&#39;s (Standard) Copy 2 Residual Tax</h3>
  <p style="margin-left: 8px;">If Residual Tax Withholding is used, Local tax may be overstated on Line 2 of the W2&#39;s. The following new registry entry will omit the print of Local Line 2 on the W2&#39;s.</p>

  <h3>12.2.10d Alternate W2 12:DD (HSA Employer Costs) Processing</h3>
  <p style="margin-left: 8px;">Some users wish to set up an Earnings Id to process W2 12:DD (HSA Employer Costs) and include this Earnings Id in regular PR processing. This procedure populated both prhstryernngs_amnt_ernngs &amp; prhstryernngs_amnt_fringe fields. The W2 report sums (prhstryernngs_amnt_ernngs + prhstryernngs_amnt_fringe) which is cause the amount in box 12:DD to be overstated. </p>
  <p style="margin-left: 40px;">NOTE: This processing does not follow the instructions in the Data-Basics EOY document.</p>
  <p style="margin-left: 8px;">In this release, setting the Earning record&#39;s User2 field to a value of FringeOnlyW2 changes the default behavior to only include prhstryernngs_amnt_frnge in the calculation for specific earnings on W2&#39;s which corrects the overstatement.</p>

  <h3>12.2.20a <b><span style="font-family: Calibri, sans-serif;">Registry and Data Requirements for PR 941S Summary with Covid 19 FFCRA Reporting</span></b></h3>
  <h5>Families First Coronavirus Response Act</h5>
  <p>In response to the COVID-19 Families First Coronavirus Response Act (FFCRA) this notice is to inform SAMPro users how to track employees that you pay Emergency Sick Pay &amp; Emergency Family Medical Leave due to the Coronavirus.    </p>
  <h5><b>IRS Updates</b></h5>
  <p>The IRS website https://www.irs.gov/coronavirus/coronavirus-tax-relief-for-businesses-and-tax-exempt-entities has detailed information on the <span style="font-family: &#39;Source Sans Pro&#39;, sans-serif; 
										 color: #000000;">Coronavirus Related Paid Leave for Workers and Tax Credits for Small- and Mid-Size Businesses</span> and well as the Employee Retention Credit. We strongly suggest familiarizing yourself with this information and how it pertains to your company’s current situation.</p>
  <h5><b>Tracking Information in SAMPro</b></h5>
  <p>Your firm’s ability to obtain any applicable tax credits depends accurately tracking the Coronavirus PTO.  We recommend that SAMPro users create at least three (3) new pay types to track this information to assist you in determining any future Tax Credits for employer FICA taxes. </p>
  <p>These new Pay Types would be used when entering a person’s Emergency Paid Time off or Emergency Family Leave into the Labor Journal.   These new Pay Types should not be used to enter paid time off that is not directly related to the Coronavirus pandemic.  As needed, please advise anyone allowed to enter Indirect (non-Job &amp; Overhead) related time for themselves about these new Pay Types when using other products that feed the Labor Journal (e.g. Time Anywhere, Tech Anywhere, CPP Import, etc.).</p>
  <h5>Registry to Specify Field Used for Covid Categories</h5>
  <p><span style="font-weight: bold;">Id:</span>  sys-viewer-vpytype</p>
  <p><span style="font-weight: bold;">Setting Key:</span>  CovidCategoryField      <span style="font-weight: bold;">Setting Value:</span> pytype_usr5 or pytype_usr2 (version 8.2 and below)</p>
  <p>This registry defines the Pay Type User Field that will be used by the 941S report to determine the Covid credits.</p>
  <h5>Updating/Creating Pay Types for Covid Support</h5>
  <p>Three new Pay Types are needed to support this new legislation. Please note the setting of the Pay Type User field in the following instructions. SAMPro Versions 9.0 and 9.1 support five User fields; Versions 7.0 – 8.2 support two.   A Pay Type User field will be used in planned SAMPro reporting to assist in determining any future credits. The above registry will specify which Pay Type User field you have selected for use with Coronavirus reporting.  If you have already added new Pay Types, be sure to update your selected Pay Type User fields with one of the new User values (CV-SELF, CV-PTO or CV-FML). Be sure to complete the Pay Type User fields <span style="font-weight: bold;">exactly</span> as specified below.</p>

  <h5>Additional Notes on setting up the new Coronavirus PTO Pay Types:</h5>
  <p><b>Pay Type Id’s:</b>   When adding these new Pay Types, you can use these same ID’s (CV-SELF, CV-PTO &amp; CV-FML) or create your own ID’s.   If you want to use these same Pay Type Id’s that we have suggested, then just rename those ID’s to be CV-SELF, CV-PTO &amp; CV-FML.  *TIP:  If you create your own ID’s use the same prefix so you can run reports using just the prefix (e.g.  CV% or COV%).   As needed, you may expand these Pay Type Id’s to be by branch or by department.  For example:</p>

    Optional usage.  Either leave this account blank or enter the GL Expense account this new type of pay should be charged (debited) against.  Check the setup of your other PTO related pay types to determine if you are currently tracking paid sick time in your general ledger using a different GL Expense Account(s).  If you are not, you may continue to follow suit since the SAMPro payroll reports will provide you with this information (in hours and dollars on various payroll reports).     You may also want to discuss this issue with your CPA to determine what they recommend for you.   If you do setup a GL Expense Account, it will requires using a COST CAT during Labor Entry where the GL Expense Account is blank or is setup with this same GL Account.   You can use the Employee Rate Test Viewer to view the GL impact of entering 8 hours of labor using these new Pay Types &amp; an Overhead job.  </p>
  <p><b>Pay Type User Field for Coronavirus:<br/>
      The revised PR 941S report as well as possible future </b>Data-Basics reports will look to the Pay Type’s User fields (as specified via registry) to determine if the recorded PTO hours are related to the applicable COVID-19 leave.  To ensure that the field is coded correctly, we recommend using the Custom Fields functionality to specify the allowable values entered in this field.   If you had already created Pay Types for tracking this information prior to this notice, please update your existing COVID related Pay Types with one of these new values. </p>
  <p>To access the Custom Fields functionality, go to the Pay Type viewer and right-click on the Pay Type User field you want to use for the Corona Virus coding. If you have access to the Custom Field functioning, the following message will appear. Select Customize Field (if Customize Field is not an option your IT/Admin user may be able to do this for you).</p>
  <p style="margin-left: .5in;"><img alt="" border="0" height="157" src="assets/images/COV_19-SAMPro-Notice1d_files/image001.png" width="406"/></p>
  <p>The Custom Fields viewer will open when you select Customize Fields. The following shows this setup used for the Pay Type User3 field. Notice that we have set the Custom Field Label to ‘Corona Virus:’ and entered each of our codes in the Values tab.</p>

  <h2>12.3 Safety Incident Tracking</h2>
  <h3>12.3.1 Supervisor Viewer</h3>
  <h5>Purpose:</h5>
  <p>This new record allows a Supervisor to be specified when Labor is entered. This information is written to Job History so that a record of the Supervisor responsible for each labor entry line is maintained; this information may be used to support a custom Safety Incident Analytic.</p>
  <p>The Supervisor Id may be specified in the detail lines of the following journals: Job Journal, Labor Journal, Time Labor and Work Order Labor. The Magnify button must be used to access the Supervisor field in these records.</p>
  <h5>Usage:</h5>
  <p>The Supervisor is set when time is entered via a specific custom time entry screen; this information is imported to SAMPro so that it is included in Job History. TimeAnywhere may be customized to support the entry of the Employee&#39;s Supervisor; contact your Account Manager for additional information.</p>
  <h5>Important Fields:</h5>
  <p><span style="font-weight: bold;">Supervisor Id:  Supervisor Name:</span><br/>
    These fields identify the Supervisor.</p>
  <p><span style="font-weight: bold;">Contact Id:</span><br/>
    The Contact record associated with this Supervisor. The phone, fax and email contact information shown below defaults from the Contact record.</p>
  <p><span style="font-weight: bold;">Employee Id:</span><br/>
    The Supervisor&#39;s Employee Id.</p>
  <h2>12.4 Labor Journal</h2>
  <p style="box-sizing: border-box;">SAMPro now defaults into the Labor Journal the correct Workers Comp category from the security that matches the employee&#39;s security for the following tabs: Employee Rate Test, Labor Journal, WO Labor Tab, and import from Labor Journal into WO, based on the Job Cost Category &quot;Workers Comp&quot; tab and the Workers Comp&#39;s State from the Job.</p>
  <p style="box-sizing: border-box;">This update makes the GL Entity ALWAYS required with InterCo v.cus when Intercompanyenabled is true.</p>
  <p style="box-sizing: border-box;">Validation in a previous release corrected the gap in Payroll Period validation by revising the test for an inactive accrual accounting period. Unfortunately, this validation prevented users from fully accessing previous entries because the validation was applied when changing focus from line to line. In this release, validation is only applied when the user changes a field, allowing earlier entries to be inspected.</p>
  <p>Corrects a sporadic &#39;Runtime Error: illegal character in format&#39; issues experienced by some users in Labor Journal posts from TimeAnywhere.</p>
  <p style="box-sizing: border-box;">This release corrects validation for the scenario where the Pay Period is &quot;active&quot;, Accounting Period is &quot;inactive&quot; and Accrual Accounting Period is &lt;blank&gt;.  </p>
  <p>When Intercompany is enabled and a detail line contains a Job Id, any changes to the line&#39;s GL Entity are validated to ensure that the new GL Entity belongs to the same company as the Job.</p>
  <p>A warning is now displayed when the user first accesses a journal entry which has been replaced by one with a higher &#39;tack&#39; number. This warning is designed to prevent the user from wasting time by attempting to make changes to a journal entry record which cannot be saved because it has already been replaced. See Customer Note 1.1.2 for a registry to disable this warning globally or by individual viewer. </p>
  <p>Previously, a user should receive a warning message when trying to access a Computed or Paid Labor Journal but the warning message did not appear. This update corrects this defect.</p>
  <p><span style="font-weight: bold;">PR-to-GL Accruals:</span></p>
  <p style="margin-left: 48px;">In previous releases, accruals were skipped for Standard Cost type Earnings record when an Overhead Jobs was specified. In this release, accruals are correctly posted for Standard Cost Earnings for Jobs that are not Direct.</p>
  <p style="margin-left: 48px;">Previously, changing certain values (Hours, Pay Type, etc) didn&#39;t always cause the GL Accrual Info to be recalculated.  The Accrual Info is now correctly set in the Employee, Labor Journal, Payroll Period and Work Order viewers, and in Compute Payroll.</p>
  <p style="margin-left: 8px"><span style="font-weight:bold;">Labor Journal Viewer:</span></p>
  <p style="margin-left: 8px"> In version 9.1.611.059 and up, this release supports a registry-controlled emulation for including Earnings and Deduction Groups from the Employee Recurring Wages tab for Recurring Labor entries.</p>
  <p style="margin-left: 8px">In version 9.1.611.060 and up, the WO ID on the labor lines from the labor journal does not re-load or overwrite the TA source RN when changing the WO Id so that the TA source RN carries over to new transactions. Overriding the WO Id was caused by changing the WO ID on some of the technician labor journal lines because it was created for the wrong client site.</p>
  <h3>12.4.1 Labor Journal Hours Tab</h3>
  <p>Version 9.1.611.057 corrects a validation error that did not allow the user to enter time if the primary Accounting Period was Inactive and but the Accrual Accounting Period was Active.  Time may now be entered for dates in the Accrual Accounting Period when the Payroll Period is active.</p>
  <p>Earlier releases include the following corrections and changes:</p>
  <p>A spurious &#39;Please clear line &#39;#&#39; and re-enter Bonus Amount&#39;) message when using Insert/Copy to enter multiple lines with the Bonus field completed has been removed.</p>
  <p style="font-weight: bold;">Changed Field - Cost Category:<br/>
    <span style="font-weight: normal;">When entering hours for a field employee for a indirect (overhead) job, the Cost Category from the Labor Rate is cleared if the previously auto-loaded Cost Category of the selected job would cause a job/cost category error . This allows an appropriate Cost Category to easily be entered manually.  For a field employee, when entering hours for a direct job the cost category defaults from the Labor Rate in the employee record as in previous releases.</span>
  </p>
  <p>This field now supports enhanced filtering provided by the Cost Code&#39;s Job Cost Category Usage Filter. Cost Categories are validated (relative to Cost Codes) during data entry upon leaving the Cost Category Id field.  The full relationship is validated again when leaving a child line or saving a record.</p>
  <h3>(Magnify view)</h3>
  <p><span style="font-weight: bold;">New Field - Supervisor Id:</span><br/>
    If completed, this field specifies the Supervisor responsible for the work in this entry.</p>
  <p><span style="font-weight: bold;">Changed Field - Bonus:</span><br/>
    Since a Bonus should never be entered on a line which also records hours, validation prevents the user from entering hours and a Bonus on the same line.</p>
  <p>The Local, State and Other Tax Authority fields also default from the Employee record when a Bonus amount is entered. If a Field type Cost Code is then selected, the fields are overridden from the Job record. This defaulting works the same as when hours are entered.  </p>
  <h3>12.4.1a  Special Federal/State Tax Rates for Bonus Pay</h3>
  <p style="font-weight: bold;">Labor Journal Hours Tab Detail View</p>
  <p>Note: a new v.cus file may be needed to see these fields if a data-conversion was not triggered when upgrading to this version.</p>
  <p>This enhancement eliminates the need to edit the Employee record before and after bonus checks are run in order to apply a Federal Income Tax (and if needed, State)  flat rate to bonus pay.  See Customer Note 12.2.5a for additional Usage instructions and details to running Bonus Check with this newer methodology.</p>
  <p style="font-weight: bold;">New Fields:</p>
  <p style="font-weight: bold;">Federal Tax Rate:<br/>
    State Tax Rate:<br/>
    <span style="font-weight: normal;">These fields provide a flat rate override to the Federal / State Income Tax rate brackets in the Employee&#39;s Federal (FED-M or FED-S) and State Tax Tables. These fields are intended to be used for Bonus pay only. If these field are blank, the Federal / State Tax Table will be used as before.</span> <span style="font-weight: normal;">Tax is on Total Earnings when using this option. If this is not desired, the old methodology of changing the Employee record&#39;s Tax tab to specify a flat tax FED-bonus entry may be used instead.</span>
  </p>
  <h3> 12.4.1b Special Bonus Posting And Accrual Configuration (Union Wages) - Versions Prior to 9.1.611.057</h3>
  <p style="margin-left: 48px;"><span style="font-weight: bold;">IMPORTANT:</span> See Customer Note 12.4.1.d for a simplified configuration supported by SAMPro Version 9.1.611.057 and Above</p>
  <p>This configuration addresses the scenario where an employee doesn’t get wages over and above the union wages (Earnings Group) specified in the Employee record&#39;s Default Tab. When entering a Bonus amount in the Labor Journal, the following special process is required so that their bonus amount will post:  </p>
  <p style="margin-left: 48px;">Create a special Pay Type record (e.g., OnCall for On Call Bonuses).</p>
  <p style="margin-left: 48px;">In the OnCall Pay Type Record, set the Default Earning Group to an OnCall group that has one line with $.01 as the pay rate.</p>
  <p style="margin-left: 48px;">The OnCall Pay Type should also reference a Deduction Group with no child lines.</p>

  <p>When the Bonus is entered in the Labor Journal using the OnCall Pay Type, the penny will be ignored when the flat rate Bonus is entered.</p>
  <h3>12.4.1c Change Field: Bonus</h3>
  <p>A negative Bonus now posts to the GL correctly:  Debit to Accrued Payroll and Credit to Expense. Computing Payroll relieves Accrued Payroll correctly for amount of Gross Wages including Credited Bonus. This allows the user to enter bonus line with a negative amount to account for having to reduce a salaried employee&#39;s gross pay.</p>
  <h3>12.4.1d  Special Bonus Posting And Accrual Configuration (Union Wages) - Version 9.1.611.057 And Above</h3>
  <p>In previous releases, the bonus accrual did not work if the Employee Earnings tab had no wages; it was necessary to follow the procedures described in Customer Note 12.4.1.b when entering a Bonus amount in the Labor Journal.</p>
  <p>In this release all that is needed is to set up the employee with an Earnings Id for $.00 on his Employee record - thus eliminating the need for that special Earnings Group for $.01. This Earnings Id will provide the information needed to derive the posting accounts. This enhancement eliminates the requirement that an hourly rate must be determined for posting values to populate from the bonus amount.  </p>
  <h3>12.4.2 Labor Journal Other Tab</h3>
  <p>
    <font style="font-weight: bold;">Changed Field - Cost Category:</font><br/>
    This field now supports enhanced filtering provided by the Cost Code&#39;s Job Cost Category Usage Filter. Cost Categories are validated (relative to Cost Codes) during data entry upon leaving the Cost Category Id field.  The full relationship is validated again when leaving a child line or saving a record.
  </p>
  <h2>12.5 Employee Viewer</h2>
  <p>Users (with access to Employee records) must have Executive P/R flagged in their User record in order to access Employee records flagged as Executive Payroll.</p>
  <h3>12.5.1 Paid Time Off Tab</h3>
  <p><span style="font-weight: bold;">New Field - Max Hours:</span><br/>
    This field supports PTO based on a Annual Maximum Balance (or Cap) for companies with a “Use it or Lose it” PTO policy. This field specifies the Cap or maximum total PTO hours &#39;in the bank&#39; that  this employee is allowed to accrue for the specified Pay Type Id/Sate range.  When Compute Payroll is run, the accrued hours may be limited so that the Max Hours Cap is not exceeded.</p>
  <p style="margin-left: 48px;"><span style="font-weight: bold;">Setup:</span><br/>
    Typically, the  PTO tab would need to be set up based on the employees date hired (anniversary date) and Years of Service (i.e. 1-4yrs, 5-9yrs, 10-14yrs, 15+).</p>
  <h3>12.5.2 Rate Test Tab</h3>
  <p style="font-weight: bold;">New Fields:</p>
  <p style="margin-left: 8px;"><span style="font-weight: bold;">Employee Viewer Rate Test Tab:</span><br/>
    <span style="font-weight: bold;">New Field: Select Rate Method to Test</span><br/>
    By default, the Rate Method will be set to configuration currently in use (see table below). Switching to a different Method will automatically reset the Rate Tab to the values which would be obtained if that method were in effect.

  <h3>12.5.5 Employee Recurring Other Tab</h3>
  <p><span style="font-weight: bold;">Changed Field: Cost Category</span><br/>
    This field now supports enhanced filtering provided by the Cost Code&#39;s Job Cost Category Usage Filter.</p>
  <h3>12.5.6 Employee User Fields Tab</h3>
  <p><span style="font-weight: bold;">New Fields - User 11-20:</span><br/>
    Added User fields 11-20 for informational and reporting purposes.</p>
  <h3><span style="font-weight: bold;">12.5.7 Employee Taxes Tab</span></h3>
  <p>Tax for Authorities not marked &#39;Always Withhold&#39; are only assessed for labor on Jobs referencing that Tax Authority, correcting a problem in recent releases.</p>
  <h3>12.5.8 Employee Deductions / Earnings Tabs</h3>
  <p>Registries are now required to automatically sort the Employee&#39;s Earnings and Deductions tabs, and the Earnings Group and Deduction Group child tabs. See Customer Note 16.6.3.</p>
  <h3>12.5.9 Employee Viewer Registy</h3>
  <p>Previously when the following registry was enabled, a warning would appear in the Employee Viewer when there were duplicate Social Security Numbers for other employees. This occurred every time the user saved, even if the SSN was not changed. Now, the warning only appears if the user edits the SSN field with a duplicate SSN. <br/>
    <strong>Id: </strong>sys-viewer-vemplye<br/>
    <strong>Setting Key: </strong>AllowDuplicateTaxId    <strong>Setting Value:</strong> true
  </p>
  <h2>12.6  Compute Payroll</h2>
  <p>This release implements performance improvements in this function.  </p>
  <p>This release corrects the setting of the Earnings Id where a &#39;fixed&#39; earning amount type is specified (such as a Bonus amounts entered on the Employee Recurring Wages tab).  </p>
  <p><span style="font-weight: bold;">New Display Only Field: Deduction Cycles</span><br/>
    This display field the default Deduction Cycles specified in the selected Payroll Period.</p>
  <p><span style="font-weight: bold;">Changed Field: Pay/Deduction Cycles To Include</span><br/>
    This field now defaults from the Deduction Cycles field in the Payroll Period.</p>
  <p style="font-weight: normal;">If a Pay Type is flagged as Union Exempt, the Employee&#39;s Earnings Group will NOT be written to PR History for this Pay Type when Compute Payroll is run.  This corrects an issue in previous releases where Union Exempt pay types appeared on Union reports.</p>
  <p style="font-weight: normal;">This release corrects a sporadic virtual stack overflow error when OT Premiums are allocated.</p>
  <p style="font-weight: normal;">This release implements intercompany processing for employer taxes (etc) allocated during the compute.</p>
  <p style="font-weight: normal;"><span style="font-weight:bold;">Payroll:</span></p>
  <p style="font-weight: normal;">Payroll 941S updated to support larger quarterly wage/tax amounts fields. Previously, wages of more than $9,999,999.99 in a quarter were subject to truncation, now support $99,999,999.99. Tax fields added another character of precision. Release date: 11-15-2021</p>
  <p style="font-weight: normal;"><span style="font-weight:bold;">Compute Payroll:</span></p>
  <p style="font-weight: normal;">In version 9.1.611.059 and up, this release refines Compute Payroll processing to allow for negative earnings AND negative taxes (except for annualized taxes e.g. federal &amp; state tables) when the following existing registry is set.</p>
  <p style="font-weight: normal;">In version 9.1.611.060 and up, this update resolves an issue with the Job Cost posting the regular rate instead of the BLENDED rate when an employee has accumulated over time. Before, posting to GL correctly used the BLENDED rate but posting to JobCost used the REGULAR rate from the employee record.</p>
  <p style="font-weight: normal;">Previously in versions 9.1.611.057 and prior, SAMPro rounded the non-annualized taxes up by a penny. Versions 9.1.611.058 and up are no longer rounding the non-annualized taxes up by a penny. The 9.1.611.062 update now rounds the taxes up by a penny.</p>
  <h3>12.6.1 Hard Blocking by Branch</h3>
  <p>Compute Payroll now supports the Hard Block logic (implemented by the BranchFilterWithHardBlock global settings registry option) in this version.  The Hard Block is maintained regardless of how the Branch filter range is set.</p>
  <h3>12.6.2 Use It or Lose It PTO</h3>
  <p>Compute Payroll now supports PTO based on a Annual Maximum Balance (or Cap) for companies with a “Use it or Lose it” PTO policy. When Compute Payroll is run, the accrued hours may be limited so that the Max Hours cap (specified on the Max Hours field of the Employee&#39;s Paid Time Off tab) is not exceeded. If PTO hours are &#39;lost&#39; to the Max Hours cap being exceeded, the hours and earning lost will be written to the PTO Hours Lost and PTO Earning Lost in Payroll History.</p>
  <h3>12.6.3 Refinements to Extra Withholding</h3>
  <p>In previous releases, if annualized Gross Pay was not high enough to qualify for a taxable rate line on an applicable Tax Table, extra withholding would not be applied. This release corrects this issue and allows the specified extra withholding to be applied. Note that if the extra withholding would result in negative net pay, the compute will return an error. This must be corrected (e.g., by temporarily reducing the extra withholding) before a check can be produced.</p>
  <h3>12.6.4 Garnishments</h3>
  <p>This release refines the disposable pay garnishment calculations for US and Canadian Payroll users where the garnishment is a percentage of disposable pay. These are now based on the settings of the new Disposable Income fields in the Deductions record.  See Customer Note 12.15.1 for details on these new fields.</p>
  <h3>12.6.5 Work Order Labor Reversal</h3>
  <p>This release better handles scenarios where the Work Order Labor tab is used to move hours from one Job to another. Previously, the system would sometimes post pennies to Job Cost for Work Order labor fixed-type fringes that were reversed, creating unbilled costs for the Work Order.</p>
  <h3>12.6.6 Start Compute PR - Intercompany Security</h3>
  <p>This release adds InterCompany Security to the Compute PR functionality. When using InterCompany, if an Employee&#39;s GL Entity is switched (on the Employee record) to a different Company/Security during the calendar year, Compute Payroll will now calculate payroll taxes with the correct annual limits and tax amounts for the new company or companies if multiple company moves are done during the year.  Tax types with annual limits include:  FUTA, SUTA &amp; FICA (SS &amp; MCAD).</p>
  <p>A registry setting is NOT required to enable this new default behavior when using InterCompany.  No setting is required if Intercompany is NOT enabled.</p>
  <p>Id: sys-compute-payroll</p>
  <p>Setting Key: UseEmployeeCompanySecurity   Setting Value: true (true is the default)</p>
  <p>*Warning*:  It should never be set to false when using InterCompany.</p>
  <h2>12.7 Start CPP Time Import</h2>
  <p>This update adds the Bonus Amount to the Start CPP Time Import function so users can import Taxable Reimbursements for their employees who receive different amounts each month for Vehicle usage.</p>
  <p>The Security is now set using the same logic as manual Labor Journal entries.<br/>
    Negative hours (with a leading minus) are supported in this version.</p>
  <h2>12.8 Earnings Viewer</h2>
  <p><span style="font-weight: bold;">New Fields - Earnings User3-5</span><br/>
    These additional fields may be used for payroll setup.</p>
  <p><span style="font-weight: bold;">Earnings Record Changed Fields - GL Debit changed to GL Debit (Indirect):</span></p>
  <p><span style="font-weight: bold;">GL Account</span><br/>
    The GL Account expense account earnings / accruals are posted to for Overhead (Indirect) Jobs when the Payroll and Post Payroll to GL functions are run.</p>
  <p><span style="font-weight: bold;">GL Entity:</span><br/>
    The Entity charged for expense for Overhead (Indirect) Jobs.</p>
  <p style="font-weight: bold;">New Fields - GL Debit (Direct)</p>
  <p style="margin-left: 48px;"><span style="font-weight: bold;">GL Account</span><br/>
    The GL Account expense account earnings / accruals are posted to for Direct Jobs when the Payroll and Post Payroll to GL functions are run.</p>
  <p style="margin-left: 48px;"><span style="font-weight: bold;">GL Entity:</span><br/>
    The Entity charged for expense for Direct Jobs.</p>
  <p style="margin-left: 8px;">The database conversion process completes these new fields by from the original GL Debit fields.</p>
  <h3>12.8.0 Recent Update - Labor-to-GL Postings</h3>
  <p style="margin-left: 8px;">This release corrects an issue where PR GL Accruals did not always select the correct Debit Direct GL Entity. This release modifies the setting of the Debit Direct GL Entity as follows:</p>
  <p style="margin-left: 8px;">If the Earnings record&#39;s GL Debit Direct GL Entity is blank, it is now set from the Job Cost Code on the Labor line. Previously, the GL Debit Indirect GL Entity in the Earning&#39;s record was used.</p>
  <p style="margin-left: 8px;">If the Earnings GL Debit Direct GL Entity is set, it will be used for Direct Jobs as before.</p>
  <p style="margin-left: 8px;"><span style="font-weight: bold;">IMPORTANT:</span> Completing the GL Entities in the Earnings records is not advisable for someone using Intercompany unless they establish multiple earnings id&#39;s for EACH COMPANY.</p>
  <h3>12.8.1 Earnings Viewer - Job Cost Hourly Rate Calculations (CIP Discounts)</h3>
  <p>In the original implementation, all N/A-type earnings were subject to CIP Discounting.  In this case, a flag has been added to the Earnings record to allow selection of specific N/A earnings to discount.</p>
  <p><span style="font-weight: bold;">New Field - CIP Discount?</span><br/>
    If this field is flagged and the Earnings Type is N/A, CIP Discounts will be applied to this Earning record.</p>
  <p style="margin-left: 48px;"><span style="font-weight: bold;">Upgrade Note:</span> If CIP Discounts were implemented in Version 9.0, this box MUST be flagged for the discounts to continue to be taken.</p>
  <h3>12.8.2 Earnings Record - Special Processing of W2 12:DD (HSA Employer Costs)</h3>
  <p style="margin-left: 8px;">Some users wish to set up an Earnings Id to process W2 12:DD (HSA Employer Costs) and include this Earnings Id in regular PR processing. This procedure populated both prhstryernngs_amnt_ernngs &amp; prhstryernngs_amnt_fringe fields. The W2 report sums (prhstryernngs_amnt_ernngs + prhstryernngs_amnt_fringe) which is causing the amount in box 12:DD to be overstated. </p>
  <p style="margin-left: 48px;">NOTE: This processing does not follow the instructions in the Data-Basics EOY document.</p>
  <p style="margin-left: 8px;">In this release, setting the Earning record&#39;s User2 field to a value of FringeOnlyW2 changes the default behavior to only include prhstryernngs_amnt_frnge in the calculation for specific earnings on W2&#39;s which corrects the overstatement.</p>
  <h2>12.9 Deduction Groups</h2>
  <p>Registries are now required to automatically sort the Employee&#39;s Earnings and Deductions tabs, and the Earnings Group and Deduction Group child tabs. See Customer Note 16.6.3.</p>
  <p><span style="font-weight: bold;">New Field - Classification Id:</span><br/>
    This field has been added for reporting purposes at the level of distinction &quot;by Union Classification.&quot;</p>
  <p><span style="font-weight: bold;">New Fields: Deduction Group User3-5</span><br/>
    These additional fields may be used for payroll setup.</p>
  <h2>12.9a Earnings Groups</h2>
  <p>Registries are now required to automatically sort the Employee&#39;s Earnings and Deductions tabs, and the Earnings Group and Deduction Group child tabs. See Customer Note 16.6.3.</p>
  <h2>12.10 Payroll Period</h2>
  <p>Users (with access to Payroll Periods) must have Executive P/R flagged in their User record in order to access Payroll Period records flagged as Executive Payroll. This release adds validation preventing a Payroll Period from being flagged as both Default and Executive Payroll.</p>
  <h3>12.10.1 Hours Tab</h3>
  <p>The Hours Tab is now filtered based on the User&#39;s Executive PR and Branch Filter fields. Data for Executive Payroll Employees (Executive P/R flagged in the Employee record) will only be displayed if the Executive PR? box is checked in their User record.</p>
  <p>Filtering based on the User&#39;s Branch Filter only comes into play when the hard-block filtering option is turned on via the following registry setting:</p>
  <p style="margin-left: 48px;">Id: sys-ffv-global-settings<br/>
    Setting Key: BranchFilterWithHardBlock    Setting Value:true</p>
  <h3>12.10.2 Main Tab</h3>
  <p><span style="font-weight: bold;">New Field: Executive Payroll</span><br/>
    When this field is flagged, only users who have the Executive Payroll field flagged in their User record can:</p>
  <p style="margin-left: 48px;">Access the Payroll Period Record<br/>
    Access Labor Journal Transaction for Executive Payroll Periods<br/>
    Run Compute Payroll for Executive Payroll Periods<br/>
    Print Payroll Checks for Executive Payroll Periods<br/>
    Print PR Miscellaneous Deduction Checks for Executive Payroll Periods</p>
  <p style="margin-left: 48px; box-sizing: border-box;">The Executive Payroll status of the Payroll Period is NOT considered when printing W2&#39;s or T4&#39;s.  Employees flagged as Executive Payroll will only appear on these reports if the User running the report is flagged as Executive P/R.</p>
  <p style="margin-left: 48px;"><span style="font-weight: bold;">Important Note:</span> If the Executive Payroll box is checked, validation prevents the Default Payroll flag from being set.</p>
  <p style="margin-left: 48px; box-sizing: border-box;"> </p>
  <p><span style="font-weight: bold;">New Field: Deduction Cycles</span><br/>
    If completed, this field provides the default values for Start Compute Payroll&#39;s Pay/Deductions fields so that Deduction will not be accidentally skipped. Deduction Cycle information is maintained in the Deductions Group record (for union payroll) and the Employee Deduction tab (non-union). Up to five Deduction Cycles may be specified; they should NOT be separated by commas.</p>
  <p style="margin-left: 48px; text-decoration: underline; ">Examples:</p>
  <p style="margin-left: 48px;">If a Deduction Code of M is used for Monthly deductions, it would be entered in the Deduction Cycle of Payroll Periods used for Monthly pay.</p>
  <p style="margin-left: 48px;">If Deductions Codes are not used for Bonus pays, the Deduction Cycle could be set to XXXXX to prevent all Deductions from being taken. A Deduction will not be taken unless its cycle is specified; if a Deduction Cycle is blank in the Employee or Deduction Group, it will be taken if one of the Deduction Cycle fields in the Payroll Period is blank. Setting all fields to X or another character never used for Deduction Cycles will prevent this.</p>
  <p><span style="font-weight: bold;">New Field: Accrue Bonus Pay</span><br/>
    This box should be flagged if Bonus Pay entered for this Payroll Period should be accrued.</p>
  <p style="font-weight: bold; margin-left: 48px;">IMPORTANT:<br/>
    <span style="font-weight: normal;">If Bonus Pay should NEVER be Accrued, disable this field via registry.</span>
  </p>
  <p style="font-weight: bold; margin-left: 48px;"><span style="font-weight: normal;">This box may ONLY be checked if the sys-ffv-global-settings registry option LaborRatesAndAccrualMethod is set to 7687.</span></p>
  <p style="margin-left: 48px;">The sys-ffv-global-settings registry option AccrueBonusPay and Payroll Period User2 fields may be used to enable Bonus Pay Accrual instead of checking this box. <span style="font-weight: bold;"> </span></p>
  <h3>12.10.3  Payroll Period Post History Button</h3>
  <p>For &quot;ADP&quot; or other Payroll integration, the Post History button supports computing and posting Payroll history for Union reporting, fringes, PTO, etc.  The post history process updates computed PR History records filling in the Check Date and Source Journal (per registry definition). </p>
  <p>This process lacks evaluation about whether or not the computed PR History record has errors; if an error is noted, the Payroll Period will show an &quot;ERROR&quot; which was not addressed. Since the sort of errors noted in this process do not impact the ADP and other payroll services, the error count will be set to zero so that updates will not display as Errors on the Payroll Period.</p>
  <p> </p>
  <h2>12.11 Start Generate Recurring Labor</h2>
  <p>This function now correctly identifies all eligible Recurring Labor and Other entries. Previously, entries were skipped if the Employee Start/End Date fell entirely within the Payroll Period&#39;s Effective Dates.</p>
  <p><span style="font-weight: bold;">New Filter - Executive PR:</span><br/>
    If you are an Executive Payroll user, this field will default to Y; to run this function for all employees (Executive or not) clear this range. If your User record is not flagged as Executive Payroll, you will only be able to run this function for other non-Executive users even if you clear the filter.</p>
  <h2>12.12 New Viewer: Check (Employee)</h2>
  <p>Executive Payroll checks are not displayed unless the User&#39;s record has Executive PR flagged.</p>
  <p>This new Viewer lists ONLY PR checks. It is sensitive to the user&#39;s/employee&#39;s Executive Payroll status.  If the User&#39;s record has the Executive PR? box checked, PR Checks for all Employees will be listed. If the User does not have Executive PR privileges, only checks for those Employees who are NOT flagged as Executive Payroll will be listed.</p>
  <p style="margin-left: 48px;"><span style="font-weight: bold;">View Checks:</span> Although this existing function is still available, we recommend reviewing which User Groups need it. It still shows PR and Vendor checks, and is NOT sensitive to Executive Payroll.</p>
  <p style="margin-left: 8px;">User Group: Since this is a new viewer, access must be assigned to the appropriate User Group(s).  Unless the User Group also need access to AP Checks, we recommend turning off access to View Checks.</p>
  <h3>12.12.1 Registry Settings to Disable Fields </h3>
  <p style="margin-left: 8px;">Unless Checks are being entered as part of the startup process, edits to View Checks (Employee) should be disabled. We recommend the following settings for the new View Checks (Employee) viewer.</p>

  <h2>12.13  Pay Type</h2>
  <p><span style="font-weight: bold;">New Field: Union Exempt</span><br/>
    This box should ONLY be flagged if this Pay Type is used for certain types of union-exempt pay. Two things happen differently when time is charged to a Pay Type that is Union Exempt when Compute Payroll is run:</p>
  <p>1. All fringe-type lines from the Earnings Group are ignored.</p>
  <p>2. All lines from the Deduction Group are ignored.</p>
  <p>If a Pay Type is flagged as Union Exempt, the Employee&#39;s Earnings Group will NOT be written to PR History for this Pay Type when Compute Payroll is run.  This corrects an issue in previous releases where Union Exempt pay types appeared on Union reports.</p>
  <h3>12.13.1 Union Exempt Handling</h3>
  <p><span style="font-weight: bold;">Changed Field - Union Exempt:</span><br/>
    In previous releases, Pay Types marked as Union Exempt still showed up on the Union Reports.  In this release, Wages connected to union-exempt Pay Types (vacation, holiday, etc) now post a zero to the PR History Earnings Group column so they will not be picked up by the report.  Two things happen differently when time is charged to a Pay Type that is Fringe Exempt ...</p>
  <p style="margin-left: 48px;">1. All fringe-type lines from the Earnings Group are ignored.</p>
  <p style="margin-left: 48px;">2. All lines from the Deduction Group are ignored.</p>
  <p>Prior to this enhancement, customers had to create special &quot;no-fringe&quot; earnings groups for all their union related earnings groups. On these &quot;no fringe&quot; earnings group, they remove all Fringes and remove the Union Id to eliminate the wages &amp; fringes from their union reports for PTO.</p>

  <h3>12.15.1 Disposable Income Handling for Garnishment Calculations</h3>
  <p>This release refines the disposable pay garnishment calculations for US and Canadian Payroll users where the garnishment is a percentage of disposable pay. These are now based on the settings of the new Disposable Income fields in the Deductions record.  <span style="font-weight: bold;">Note: if the Disposable Limits field is blank for a garnishment deduction on the Employee&#39;s Deduction tab, payroll taxes will NOT be deducted before the garnishment is assessed. We recommend setting this field to 99 unless a specific percentage is required.</span></p>
  <p><span style="font-weight: bold;">New Fields -</span> <span style="font-weight: bold;">Disposable Income:</span></p>
  <p><span style="font-weight: bold;">Statutory? (set only for mandatory non-garnishments)</span><br/>
    This field would only be checked if this non-garnishment deduction is a mandatory (not voluntary) deduction. For example, Health Insurance or involuntary retirement or pension contributions would be Statutory in the US. In Canada, Canadian Pension Plan and Union Dues would be considered Statutory.</p>
  <p><span style="font-weight: bold;">Non-Statutory? (set only for voluntary non-garnishments)</span><br/>
    All voluntary, non-garnishment deductions. For example most 401K contributions (US), loan repayments, and uniform type deductions.  </p>
  <p><span style="font-weight: bold;">Allow Statutory? (set only for garnishments based on current regulations)</span><br/>
    This field would be checked if this is a garnishment type deduction (e.g., child support) AND that Statutory Deduction should be applied to the disposable pay for this garnishment.</p>
  <p><span style="font-weight: bold;">Allow Non-Statutory? (set only for garnishments based on current regulations)</span><br/>
    This field would be checked if this is a garnishment type deduction (e.g., child support) AND that Non Statutory Deductions should be applied to the disposable pay for this garnishment.</p>
  <p style="margin-left: 48px; text-decoration: underline; ">Validation:</p>
  <p style="margin-left: 48px;">Deductions CAN be marked as either Statutory or Non-Statutory (but not both)<br/>
    Deductions CAN be marked as Allow Statutory, Allow Non-Statutory or both<br/>
    Deductions can NOT be marked as both (Statutory or Non-Statutory) &amp; (Allow Statutory or Allow Non-Statutory). In other words, if you mark one of the top two you are not allowed to mark one or both of the bottom two, or vice versa.</p>
  <h2>12.16 Start ADP Import Payroll</h2>
  <p style="margin-left: 8px;">This release adds logic to post the Security RN to GL History for ADP PR GL entries.  </p>
  <p style="font-weight: bold;"><span style="font-weight: normal;">This function has been enhanced to deny the import of blank GL Entity codes if Inter-Company is enabled. Also includes validation for debits = credits by Company if Inter-Company is enabled.</span>  </p>
  <h2>12.17 Start Payroll GL Import</h2>
  <p style="font-weight: bold;"><span style="font-weight: normal;">This function has been enhanced to deny the import of blank GL Entity codes if Inter-Company is enabled. Also includes validation for debits = credits by Company if Inter-Company is enabled.</span>  </p>
  <h2>12.18 Compute Overtime</h2>
  <p>This release corrects a missing commit in this function. Previously, if the user ran this function and then exited SAMPro <span style="text-decoration: underline; ">immediately</span>, the Labor Journals created by this function would &#39;vanish&#39;.  </p>
  <p>See Customer Note 12.1.21 for a registry option to Calculate Overtime by Day / Payroll Period.</p>
  <h3>12.18.0 Enhancement When Checks are Not Printed/Posted</h3>
  <p>This release extends the functionality of the Overtime calculator work even when checks are not actually printed and posted. To accomplish this, registry settings have been enabled to change the functionality of the Payroll Period&#39;s Post History button to generate Job and GL History as well as Payroll History (default functionality).  Note that the Post History button must be clicked after Compute Overtime and Compute Payroll have been run.</p>
  <p><br/>
    In version 9.1.611.059 and up, this release resolves a bug for users not assigned to ALL Group when creating a Labor Journal that would result in an error message.</p>
  <h3>12.18.1 Registries</h3>
  <p>In addition to the existing registries required for Start Compute Overtime (in sys-start-scmpteovrtme and sys-strart-scmptepryll), the following registries are available to enable/control this Compute Overtime enhancement.</p>

  <h2>12.19 Medicare Additional .9% Tax - IMPORTANT ENHANCEMENT</h2>
  <p>Version 9.1.611.036 and up supports payroll processing for Medicare Additional .9% Penalty so that is it is no longer necessary to predict when the user will exceed the $200,000 and enable the Always W/H flag on the Employee Tax Tab&#39;s FICA MCAD entry in advance. However, this code did not account for pre-tax deductions (section 125, AFLAC pre-tax, etc) when using the multi-bracketed, annualized tax tables for MCAD. This meant that some excess additional medicare tax was withheld for high-wage earners.</p>
  <p>Version 9.1.611.050 supports a registry (see Customer Note 12.19.b) that, when enabled, refines the calculations to properly handle pre-tax deductions (section 125, AFLAC pre-tax, etc) when computing additional medicare tax for high-wage earners. This functionality will require payroll history adjustments if implemented after the first payroll run of the year: please contact your support representative to set up a time to do so.</p>
  <h3>12.19.a Version 9.1.611.050 and Up Setup (Recommended)</h3>
  <h5>Step 1. Payroll History Adjustments</h5>
  <p style="margin-left: 8px;">Make any needed PR History changes if this change is being made AFTER the first payroll computation of the year. Contact your support representative to schedule time for this assistance.</p>
  <h5>Step 2: Enable the new Compute PR registry</h5>
  <p style="margin-left: 8px;">Enable the registry detailed in Customer Note 12.19.b.  This registry used in conjunction with the FICA MCAD tax table discussed in Step 3 triggers the new behavior.</p>
  <h5>Step 3. Tax Tables</h5>
  <p><span style="font-weight: bold;">FICA MCAD</span> - the Base Tax tab must specify the following lines so that the first $200,000 of earnings will be exempt from the 9% penalty.</p>

  <h3>12.19.b  Registry to Refine Compute Payroll Calculations for MCAD High Earners</h3>
  <p>This release provides a registry to refine the calculations used to handle pre-tax deductions (section 125, AFL Pretax, etc) for high-wage earners.  This extends the functionality implemented in SAMPro Version: 9.1.611.036 which allowed the user to setup an MCAD Tax Table that could be referenced on the Taxes tab of the Employee record, eliminating the need to enable/disable the employee&#39;s Always Withhold flag as the $200,000 limit approaches.</p>
  <p class="support" style="margin-left: 40px;"><img alt="" border="0" height="286" src="assets/images/MCAD.png" style="border: none;" width="356"/></p>
  <p>However, the earlier code did not account for pre-tax deductions (section 125, AFLAC Pretax, etc) when using the multi-bracketed, annualized tax tables for FICA MCAD. This meant that excess additional medicare tax was withheld for high-wage earners.</p>
  <p>Version 9.1.611.050 supports the following registry that, when enabled, refines the calculations to properly handle pre-tax deductions (section 125, AFLAC Pretax, etc) when computing additional medicare tax for high-wage earners. <span style="font-style: italic; font-weight: bold;">Be sure to also read the warning below since it may be necessary to update payroll history before enabling the registry.</span></p>
  <p><span style="font-weight: bold;">Id:</span> sys-compute-payroll</p>
  <p><span style="font-weight: bold;">Setting Key:</span> UseMultiBracketAnnualizedTaxTables  <span style="font-weight: bold;">Setting Value:</span> true   (default is false)</p>
  <p style="margin-left: 48px;"><span style="font-weight: bold;">WARNING:</span> This registry changes the way MCAD taxes are calculated and written to the database where an Employee is setup to Always W/H FICA MCAD </p>
  <p style="margin-left: 48px;">If this registry is enabled <span style="font-weight: bold;">BEFORE the first payroll of the year</span> in 2020, 2021 etc. (with the multi-bracket MCAD table in place), the MCAD tax will be properly calculated for that year. No changes to PR history are needed.</p>
  <p style="margin-left: 48px;">If this registry is to be enabled anytime <span style="font-weight: bold;">AFTER the first payroll of the year</span> has been calculated (including in 2019), it will be necessary to update PR history first with the assistance of your support representative and then enable the registry before the next payroll is run. Discuss this with your support representative before making changes or enabling the registry. This step is necessary even if your firm has been running with the earlier version of multi-bracketed MCAD in Versions 9.1.611.036 - 9.1.611.049.</p>
  <h2>12.20 Workers Comp Category</h2>
  <h3>12.20.1 Support for Security Filtering</h3>
  <p style="margin-left: 8px;">This enhancement is applicable to a scenario where the WC state from the Job is used to determine the Cost Cat Workers Comp codes to use in the Labor Journal and WO Labor tab. In addition, unique Security-specific WC codes are implemented for each company containing the proper rates, and then added multiple WC codes with the same state to the cost category.  Previously, when the system matches up the Job WC state to the Job Cost Category WC Code, it did not stay within the same security and just selected the first one on the list. </p>
  <p style="margin-left: 8px;">In this release, Security has been built into this matching process so that it uses the appropriate WC code for the company that the job/labor journal transaction resides in.</p>
  <h2>12.21 Start Void PR Check</h2>
  <p>This function checks to see if associated PRMD check(s) exist. The PRMD check number validation now includes checking both the GL Account and Entity to prevent false positive warnings.</p>
  <p>When Payroll checks are voided the system now eliminates the document attachment (if one exists) to the Employee record.  The attachment to the Check record is retained.</p>
  <p style="margin-left: 8px;"><span style="font-weight: bold;">New Field: Check Description:</span><br/>
    This field defaults from the Check record. It may be edited by the user to note the reason for the void. If the Check Description field was blank when the Check is voided, the system will continue to default in the Description using the following format: Voided 07/09/2018 01:36:39 PM UserId.</p>
  <h2>12.22 <span style="font-weight: bold;">Union Payroll</span></h2>
  <p style="margin-left: 8px;">This release no longer accrues the Union Fringes for Pay Types checked Union Exempt.</p>
  <h3>12.23 Labor Rate Viewer</h3>
  <p style="font-weight: bold;">New Tab: References</p>
  <p>This tab displays all Rate Schedules associated with this Labor Rate via the Labor Rate Table. Only Labor Rate Tables referenced on a Rate Schedule will appear on this tab.</p>
  <p><span style="font-weight: bold;">Rate Schedule - Description</span><br/>
    The Rate Schedule Id and Description this Labor Rate is associated with.</p>
  <p><span style="font-weight: bold;">Start - End</span><br/>
    The Starting and Ending Date of the Rate Schedule</p>
  <p><span style="font-weight: bold;">Labor Rate Table - Rate Type - Rate</span><br/>

  <h1>14 Quoting</h1>
  <h2>14.1 Quote Registries</h2>
  <h3>14.1.1 Registry to Not Update Work Order NTE Amounts when Approval Wizard Runs</h3>
  <p>In recent releases, the Quote Manager&#39;s and Quote Master&#39;s Approval Wizards were revised to set the Work Order&#39;s Sub NTE set from the sum of the Extended Costs on the approved Sub Scope lines, and the Work Order&#39;s Client NTE from the sum of the Extended Price on the approved Scope lines including Revenue Adjustments not included. This was done to support SubAnywhere.</p>
  <p>Since this functionality is not in alignment with the business practices of certain customers, a registry is available to override the new default behavior.  When the following registry is set to false and the approval wizard is run, the Client and Sub NTE of new work orders will be 0, and the Client and Sub NTE&#39;s existing work orders will not be changed. For Both Quote Master and Quote Manager:</p>
  <p><span style="font-weight: bold;">Id:</span> sys-viewer-vwrkordr</p>

  <p>Note that this registry is set the Work Order registry!</p>
  <h3>14.1.2 Registry to Permit Manual Setting of Printed Scope Status</h3>
  <p>This registry allows the user to manually set the Quote Scope&#39;s Status to Printed in the Quote Scope Viewer (Quote Manager users) and in Quote Master&#39;s Scope tab. The registry was implemented to allow users running Crystal Reports to set their Quotes to Printed since Crystal does not support the print confirmation available in the SAMPro Quote report. Note that fully approved Scopes may not be set to Printed.</p>

  <h2>14.2 Quote Reports</h2>
  <h3>14.2.1 Report Quote Form (Standard)</h3>
  <p> </p>
  <p>The revised Report Quoted Form (RQTEFRMv90b035.rpt) dated 2018-10-11 reprints the Scope heading (Option #1 (Continued)) when the Scope spans multiple pages. </p>
  <p>The revised report (RQTEFRMv90b035.rpt) dated 2017-11-03 correctly supports negative tax values for negative scopes and quote totals.</p>
  <p>The revised report (RQTEFRMv90b035.rpt dated 2017-06-21) evaluates the ‘ n/a’ Tax Type on Scope detail lines based on Cost Category, Quote’s Sales Tax Group, and Quote’s Tax Status. This enhancement supports the global registry DeferTaxStatusDecision=true so that the Tax Type on Quote Scope detail lines defaults to &#39; n/a&#39;.</p>
  <p>This release and the revised Report Quote Form (RQTEFRMv90b035.rpt) dated 2016-09-02 correct the following issues with Estimated Sales Tax:</p>
  <p style="margin-left: 48px;">Fixed fee quotes no longer shows estimated tax if a Cost Category that is designated as nontaxable was selected in the Quote Scope.</p>
  <p style="margin-left: 48px;">Estimate Tax is now correctly printed for non-fixed fee quotes when the Print Quote Total? is cleared.</p>
  <p style="margin-left: 48px;">Estimated Tax is now calculated like tax on a Service Invoice so that the estimated tax on the Quote and the sales tax on the service invoice will agree.</p>
  <h3>14.2.1a Report Quote Form Supports Bitmap Override by Job</h3>
  <p>The revised Report Quote Form (RQTEFRMv90b035.rpt) dated 2018-05-14 supports the new bitmap override by Job functionality; the Quote must specify a header Job for this functionality. Note that this functionality only applies to the bitmap, not the sectionbackerbitmap.</p>
  <p><span style="font-weight: bold;">Registry Id:</span> sys-report-rqtefrm</p>
  <p><span style="font-weight: bold;">Setting Key:</span>  BitmapOverrideBasedOn   <span style="font-weight: bold;">Setting Value:</span> job</p>
  <p>This registry entry defines that this override is based on a user field in the quote&#39;s Job record.</p>
  <p><span style="font-weight: bold;">Setting Key:</span> BitmapOverrideField  <span style="font-weight: bold;">Setting Value:</span> <span style="font-style: italic;">job user database field</span></p>
  <p>This registry entry specifies exactly Job User field will provide the override for the base &#39;Setting Key: bitmap&#39;.  The database field name must be specified.</p>
  <p style="margin-left: 48px;">For example, the following specifies the Job&#39;s User 3 field:</p>
  <p style="margin-left: 48px;">Setting Key: BitmapOverrideField  Setting Value: jb_usr3</p>
  <p style="margin-left: 8px;"><span style="font-weight: bold;">Setting Key:</span> Job~<span style="font-style: italic;">string</span>   <span style="font-weight: bold;">Setting Value:</span> <span style="font-style: italic;">path\bitmap.</span>bmp</p>
  <p style="margin-left: 8px;">This entry provide the override bitmap file that will be used if the Job record&#39;s User field defined above contains the string specified. Notice that a tilde (~) separates Job from the string. As many of these entries may be made as needed to support the various bitmaps.</p>
  <p style="margin-left: 48px;">Example:</p>
  <p style="margin-left: 48px;">Suppose that we have a bitmap file named 010101_quote.bmp that should be used on quotes associated with Job&#39;s having the following text string 010101 in Job User 3 fields.</p>
  <p style="margin-left: 48px;">Setting Key: Job~010101  Setting Value: <span style="font-style: italic;">path\</span>010101_quote.bmp</p>
  <p style="margin-left: 8px;"><span style="font-weight: bold;">Tip:</span> Include the part of the bitmap name as the text string for clarity.</p>
  <p style="margin-left: 8px;"><span style="font-weight: bold;">Tip:</span> Including the appropriate values in your job templates will ensure that new jobs are created properly. In addition, using the Custom Fields functionality to specify the allowed values will prevent inappropriate values from being entered.</p>
  <h3>14.2.1b Report Quote Form Supports Estimated Tax by Authority</h3>
  <p>The revised Report Quote (RQTEFRMv91b048.rpt) dated 2020-04-12 corrects an “unable to insert into temp table” SQL error. This report may be installed in all versions of 9.1.611.048 and above.</p>
  <p>This release plus the revised Report Quote Form RQTEFRMv91b048.rpt dated 2019-01-08 or later adds a new input option to Show Estimated Tax By Authority. This new option was implemented to benefit Canadian customers.</p>
  <p><span style="font-weight: bold;">New Option: Show Estimated Sales Tax By Authority</span><br/>
    If this box is checked, estimated taxes will be listed by Sales Tax Authority Id (generally implemented for Canadian installations).</p>
  <p>The following registry may be used for Canadian installations to set the default value of the this box to checked when this report is run:</p>
  <p><span style="font-weight: bold;">Id:</span> sys-report-rqtefrm</p>
  <p><span style="font-weight: bold;">Setting Key</span>: initialValueFor~p_shw_estmtd_tx_by_athrty  <span style="font-weight: bold;">Setting Value:</span> true</p>
  <h3>14.2.1c Report Quote Form - Show Grand Total Only option</h3>
  <p>The revised Report Quote (RQTEFRMv91b048.rpt) dated 2019-08-23 includes a new option, Show Grand Total Only. When this input option is checked, the grand total for all options is shown with out subtotals by option.  This report also displays the Quote&#39;s Expiration Date below the Quote&#39;s Date.<span style="font-weight: bold;"> </span></p>
  <h3><span style="font-weight: bold;">14.2.2 R</span>eport Quote Recap (Standard)</h3>
  <p>The revised version of Report Quote Recap (Standard) (RQTERCP.rpt) dated 2021-02-22 supports Quotes with a total cost amount exceeding one million dollars. Previously cost totals exceeding this value were truncated.</p>
  <h2>14.3  Quote (Quotemaster)</h2>
  <p><span>Quote Scopes now support extended revenues of up to $99,999,99. Previously, revenues of ten millions and above resulted in a tab mismatch error in both the Quote Master and Quote Scope viewers. </span></p>
  <p><span style="font-weight: bold;">Import Diagnostics Wizard:</span>  Corrects a sporadic Runtime error - system primitive failed.</p>

  <h3>14.3.2 Validation</h3>
  <p>The user is now prevented from entering an Inactive Vendor on the Materials, Inventory or Subcontractor tabs.</p>
  <h3>14.3.4 <span style="font-weight: bold;">Quote List View</span></h3>
  <p>The Quote Status has been added to the QuotesByIdByWorkOrder list after Estimator Id and before Description.  </p>
  <h3>14.3.5 Quote Revenue Adjustment Tab</h3>
  <p style="margin-left: 8px; font-weight: bold;">RevAdj:   <br/>
    o Add   o Deduct<br/>
    <span style="font-weight: normal;">When SAMPro calculates the AdjBase (Adjustment Base), if it&#39;s value is negative, the Add - Deduct button is automatically flipped from its default setting. This supports the correct setting of Revenue Adjustments for negative scopes.</span>
  </p>
  <h3>14.3.6  New Scope Status: Diagnostic</h3>
  <p>The Import Diagnostics button imports costing/billing detail from the source Work Order.  Since this detail is already on the Work Order, it must NOT be written back to the Work Order during the Quote approval process or it will be double-billed. Previously, we depended on the user declining the Scope to do this. </p>
  <p>In this release, a new Scope status of Diagnostic has been added.</p>
  <p>Scopes with a Diagnostic Status will be ignored when the Approve All Options button is clicked. The Approval Wizard will all ignore Diagnostic quotes. This new functionality has the added benefit of not skewing the Analytics with &#39;declined&#39; options which were really diagnostics and not lost quotes.</p>
  <p>The Report Quote includes Diagnostics options.</p>
  <p>The Scope Status / Quote status / Status Category are set as follows if a Scope set to Diagnostic is present. Note that if ONLY a Diagnostic scope is present, the Quote will be considered inactive.</p>

  <p>Previously when approving a quote scope (via SAMPro) and the status is set to “Approved”, the Approval wizard did not recognize the approved scope to attach to a work order. Also, the &quot;Approve All Options&quot; window wasn&#39;t updated to use the same logic. This update corrects these defects.</p>
  <p><span style="font-weight: bold;">New Field - Override Acct Mgr:</span> This new field has been added to the Select Work To Do Pane. If the Quote&#39;s Client Site specifies a Service Manager, that will default in when New WO is selected and will be used to populate the Work Order&#39;s Service Manager field. The user may also select a different Service Manager for the new Work Order.</p>
  <p class="MsoNormal" style="margin-left: 8px;">In previous releases, if the Hourly Price was manually adjusted in the Quote Scope Labor tab, the revised value was not carried through to the existing Work Order when the Approval Wizard was run (the value from the Labor Rate was defaulted instead). In this release, the Quote Scope&#39;s Hourly Price is correctly set as the Work Order Labor&#39;s Revenue when the quote is approved.</p>
  <p class="MsoNormal" style="margin-left: 8px;">When the Create Job Budget option of the Quote Approval wizard is selected, Budgeted Revenues are now written for T&amp;M Quotes; previously only Budgeted Costs were written. The Quote&#39;s Revenue Adjustments also generate a Budget Entry (+ or -) to the Job / Cost Code specified.  </p>
  <p style="margin-left: 8px;">The Wizard now writes to the Work Order Log Tab when a new WO is created or updated.</p>
  <p class="MsoNormal" style="margin-right: 1.9pt; margin-left: 8px;">Revenue Adjustments of approved option(s) are now included in the NTE Client field when a new WO is created unless the NTE update is suppressed via registry.</p>
  <p class="MsoNormal" style="margin-right: 1.9pt; margin-left: 8px;">This release corrects a problem in the Approval Wizard where the Scope of Services text written to the WO Work Requested was converted to all lowercase.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes;"> </span>The Scope of Services is written to the WO Work Requested if the SetWOWRFromScope option is enabled in sys-viewer-vqtemngr.</p>
  <p class="MsoNormal" style="margin-right: 1.9pt; margin-left: 8px;"><strong>Quote Manager Viewer: </strong> </p>
  <p class="MsoNormal" style="margin-right: 1.9pt; margin-left: 8px;">In version 9.1.611.059 and up, clicking the revised Approve Options button displays the Approved Options wizard, so the user can select which eligible options (Open, Print or Accepted) to Approved.</p>
  <p class="MsoNormal" style="margin-right: 1.9pt; margin-left: 8px;"><img src="assets/images/image.jpg"/></p>
  <p class="MsoNormal" style="margin-right: 1.9pt; margin-left: 8px;"> </p>
  <h3>14.4.2 Quote Manager Reset Tax Type</h3>
  <p><img alt="" border="0" src="assets/images/image/resetTaxStatusJCH.gif" style="border: none;"/> <span style="font-weight: bold;">New Button: Reset Tax Type</span></p>
  <p>Click this button to reset the Tax Type of the detail lines for all Open Scopes based on the Quote Manager&#39;s Tax Status and Tax Group, as well as the Cost Category of the Scope detail lines. This button would be used if Scope lines were entered before the Sales Tax Group was set, or if the Sales Tax Group or Tax Status was changed after adding lines. The Quote report calculates Estimated Tax for non-Fixed Fee Scopes on a line by line basis so it is important that the Tax Type is set correctly.</p>
  <h3>14.4.3 Quote Manager List View</h3>
  <p>The Quote Status has been added to the QuotesByIdByWorkOrder list after Estimator Id and before Description.  </p>
  <h3>14.4.4 Quote Manager Notes</h3>
  <p>In this release, all Notes attached to the Quote Manager and each of its associated Scopes will be available from the Quote Manager AND Quote Scope viewers. For example, for a quote with 2 scopes and notes entered on the Quote, Scope 1 and Scope 2, will have all 3 notes attached.  </p>
  <h3>14.4.5 Quote Manager New Buttons</h3>
  <h5>XOi Vision Info<br/>
    <img alt="" border="2" src="assets/images/XOilink.png" style="border: Solid 2px #808080;"/>
  </h5>
  <p>This button launches a link  to XOi&#39;s page, to display XOi &quot;Jobs&quot; linked to the selected Quote (these are not SAMPro Jobs). The user will be alerted if XOi is implemented but XOi &quot;Jobs&quot; are not associated with this Quote. If XOi is not implemented, nothing will happen when the button is clicked.</p>
  <h5>Decline All Options</h5>
  <p><img alt="" border="0" src="assets/images/DeclineAll.bmp" style="border: none;"/> When clicked, this new button will set all Open, Accepted and Printed Scope options to Declined. Options set to Approved and Diagnostic will not be set to Declined. Note that the user must save the Quote Manager record after clicking Decline All in order to correctly update the Quote Manager&#39;s status.</p>
  <h2>14.5 Quote Scope</h2>
  <p>Version 9.1.611.056 does not allow Approved scopes to be deleted so that the link between the Quote and the Work Order is retained.</p>
  <p>Changes to earlier releases:</p>
  <p style="margin-left: 48px;"><span style="font-weight: bold;">Import Diagnostics Wizard:</span>  Corrects a sporadic Runtime error - system primitive failed.</p>
  <p style="margin-left: 48px;">Corrects sporadic Tab Mismatch errors on multiple labor, inventory, material and other line extended price summations.</p>
  <p style="margin-left: 48px;">Corrects a sporadic Runtime Error when clicking the Flat Rate Import button.</p>
  <p style="margin-left: 48px;">New Scopes automatically default the Job&#39;s Revenue Adjustment Id. If a Work Order with a single piece of Equipment is specified in the Quote / Quote Manager, the Equipment Id also defaults on new Scopes.   </p>
  <h3>14.5.1 Cost Category Rules</h3>
  <p>The rules regarding allowed Cost Category Selection Types have changed as follows on the following tabs:</p>

  <h3>14.5.2 Quote Scope Validation</h3>
  <p>The user will now be prevented from entering an Inactive Vendor on the Scope&#39;s Materials, Inventory or Subcontractor tabs.</p>
  <h3>14.5.3 Recent Quote Scope Enhancements</h3>
  <p>Quote Scopes now support extended revenues of up to $99,999,99. Previously, revenues of ten millions and above resulted in a tab mismatch error in both the Quote Master and Quote Scope viewers.</p>
  <p style="font-weight: bold;"><span><span style="font-weight: bold;">Changed Fields: Rate Schedule, Gross Margin % - Markup %<br/>
        <span style="font-weight: normal;">If the Rate Schedule, Margin or Markup is changed, the system will recompute the prices on previously entered lines as needed.  Only Scopes with a status of Open or Accepted (if enabled via registry) are eligible for the change. Clearing the Rate Schedule, Margin AND Markup fields (so that none are set) does NOT trigger the recompute.</span></span></span></p>
  <p style="font-weight: bold;">New Button: <img alt="" border="0" src="assets/images/Recompute.bmp" style="border: none;"/></p>
  <p style="font-weight: bold;"><span style="font-weight: normal;">Clicking the Recompute Scope button will recompute the prices based on the Rate Schedule, Gross Margin % or Markup % This button is useful to use if the Rate Schedule has recently been changed.  The button may only be used for Scopes with a status of Open or Accepted (if enabled via registry).</span></p>
  <p><span style="font-weight: bold;">New Button:</span> <img alt="" border="0" src="assets/images/CopyFromScope.bmp" style="border: none;"/></p>
  <p>This enhancement extends the &quot;Copy From&quot; functionality to allow a Scope to be copied from any Quote, not just the one that the current Scope belongs to.</p>
  <p>When the &quot;Copy From Any Scope&quot; icon is pressed, the system validates that the current Scope has been Added/Saved. Next, the wizard allows the user to select the Quote Id to copy from; the current Quote Id will be defaulted but may be changed by the user so that any Quote may be copied from. Next, the Scope selection screen will appear, so that the user can choose which option to import. Note that all the child tabs from the selected Scope are imported EXACTLY as they existed in the original Quote/Scope.</p>
  <p><span style="font-weight: bold;">Main Tab <img alt="" border="0" src="assets/images/ParentQuote.bmp" style="border: none;"/></span><br/>
    Clicking this new button accesses the Scope&#39;s Quote Manager record.</p>
  <p style="margin-left: 8px;"><span style="font-weight: bold;">Quote Scope Viewer Scheduling Tab:</span><br/>
    <span style="font-weight: bold;">Opened By - Date Opened - Time Opened:</span> Previously, these fields were updated with the current User, Date and Time if a Scope was reopened.  Now they are only set when the Scope is created.  
  </p>
  <h3>14.5.4 Quote Scope Revenue Adjustment Tab</h3>
  <p style="margin-left: 8px; font-weight: bold;">Changed Fields -</p>
  <p style="margin-left: 8px; font-weight: bold;">RevAdj:   <br/>
    o Add   o Deduct<br/>
    <span style="font-weight: normal;">When SAMPro calculates the AdjBase (Adjustment Base), if it&#39;s value is negative, the Add - Deduct button is automatically flipped from its default setting. This supports the correct setting of Revenue Adjustments for negative scopes.</span>  
  </p>
  <h3>14.5.5 Quote Scope Notes</h3>
  <p style="margin-left: 8px; font-weight: normal;">Previously when a user would enter a negative quantity for a Sub in Quote Scope and then save, a vague error message would appear.  In 9.1.611.061 and up, when a negative quantity is provided, a message stating “A negative Subcontractor quantity is not allowed when a vendor is entered” appears and does not allow users to save. </p>
  <p style="margin-left: 8px; font-weight: normal;">In 9.1.611.060b and up, this update corrects a defect where input fields would disappear after importing diagnostics in the Quote Manager. </p>
  <p style="margin-left: 8px; font-weight: normal;">In 9.1.611.060 and up, this update notes the user IDs and time stamps on its state transition in the Quote Scope. This will provide history if there is an apparent need to investigate the data.</p>
  <p style="margin-left: 8px; font-weight: normal;">In previous releases, if the user accessed the Quote Scope viewer from the list, clicking the Notes button would either not display all Notes or generate the message &#39;If you want to view notes you must access this Quote Scope from its Quote Manager Parent&#39;. This has now been changed that when the Notes button is hit the Quote Manager viewer for the Scope will be loaded and the Notes viewer will display the Notes.</p>
  <p style="margin-left: 8px; font-weight: bold;"><span style="font-weight: normal;">In this release, all Notes attached to the Quote Manager and each of its associated Scopes will be available from the Quote Manager AND Quote Scope viewers. For example, for a quote with 2 scopes and notes entered on the Quote, Scope 1 and Scope 2, will have all 3 notes attached.</span>  </p>
  <h3>14.5.6 Quote Scope Subcontractor Tab</h3>
  <p style="font-weight: bold;">Changed Fields - Quantity - PO Id:  Vendor Id:<br/>
    <span style="font-weight: normal;">The PO Id will default from the source Work Order&#39;s Purchase Order Id when the user enters the Quantity and then tabs out of the field. The Vendor Id will be defaulted from the PO.</span>  
  </p>
  <p>Previously, this functionality only existed in the old Quote viewer&#39;s Subcontractors tab.</p>
  <h3>14.5.7 New Scope Status: Diagnostic</h3>
  <p>The Import Diagnostics button imports costing/billing detail from the source Work Order.  Since this detail is already on the Work Order, it must NOT be written back to the Work Order during the Quote approval process or it will be double-billed. Previously, we depended on the user declining the Scope to do this. </p>
  <p>In this release, a new Scope status of Diagnostic has been added. When the Import Diagnostics wizard is run it sets the Scope Status to Diagnostic and refreshes the Scope viewer (sets but not does not refresh in Quote viewer because no one should be using it).</p>
  <p>Scopes with a Diagnostic Status will be ignored when the Approve All Options button is clicked. The Approval Wizard will all ignore Diagnostic quotes. This new functionality has the added benefit of not skewing the Analytics with &#39;declined&#39; options which were really diagnostics and not lost quotes.</p>
  <p>The Report Quote includes Diagnostics options.</p>
  <p>The Scope Status / Quote status / Status Category are set as follows if a Scope set to Diagnostic is present. Note that if ONLY a Diagnostic scope is present, the Quote will be considered inactive.</p>

  <h2>14.5.8 Quote Scope Inventory Price Level</h2>
  <p>This release updates the setting of the Inventory Price Level to make the Work Order and Quote Scope Inventory tabs more consistent. The hierarchy in the current release follows:</p>
  <p style="font-weight: bold;">Quote Scope:</p>
  <p>If the Quote references a Site (but not a Job), the Site&#39;s Price Level is used as in previous releases.<br/>
    If the Quote references a Job, the Job&#39;s Price Level is used (previously the Site was always used).<br/>
    When the Job &amp; Site Levels are both blank use the Price Level 1.</p>
  <p style="font-weight: bold;">Work Order Inventory:</p>
  <p>When both the Job &amp; Site have a Price Level use the Job Level (same as previous)<br/>
    When the Job Level is blank, use the Site Level (same as previous)<br/>
    When the Job &amp; Site Levels are both blank use the Work Order Price Level which defaults to 1 in this scenario</p>
  <p>This is also supported for Price Code exceptions.</p>
  <p style="font-weight: bold;">Work Order Invoicing Tab</p>
  <p><span style="font-weight: bold;">Changed Field: Mat Price Level &gt; Site Price Level</span><br/>
    The display-only Mat Price Lvl field on the Work Order&#39;s Invoicing tab has been changed to Site Price Level to better define it&#39;s source. Note that if the Material Price Level is defined in the Job, it will be used instead of the Site&#39;s Price Level with detail lines are added to the Work Order.</p>
  <h3>14.5.9 Quote Scope Unit Price Fields</h3>
  <p>The Quote Scope Unit Price fields on the Inventory, Material, Subcontractor and Other tabs has been has been changed to two decimal points from four (#,###,###.#### to #,###,###.##) to prevent issues with fractional pennies causing discrepancies between printed quotes and service invoices.</p>
  <p>For existing quotes, the unit price will be rounded (if needed) when the Scope is loading into the viewer but the change will not made to the database until the record is saved.</p>
  <p class="Support" style="margin-left: 88px;"> </p>
  <h2>14.7 Approval Wizard</h2>
  <p style="margin-left: 8px;"><span style="font-weight: bold;">Work To Do Pane New Field - Customer PO#:</span><br/>
    When posting to a New WO, this field will be used to set the PO# field on the Work Order with the PO# provided by the customer. The User is required to enter the Customer PO# number if the PO Required field is flagged in the Site&#39;s Service tab.</p>
  <p style="margin-left: 8px;">Previously, the Remote Technician warning was treated as an error and the approval stopped. In this release, the warning is suppressed so the Approval wizard can run.</p>
  <p>The Quote&#39;s Service Category defaults the new WO&#39;s Service Category. If the Quote&#39;s Service Category is empty, the new WO&#39;s will continue to default from the Work Code.</p>
  <p>When the Approval Wizard is run, the Tax Group and Tax Status in the selected Job are now used to when generating Work Order detail lines.  </p>
  <p>Since Payroll Period validation is not applicable to WO Labor flagged as Quoted, the Approval Wizard ignores this validation when generating WO Labor lines.</p>
  <h3>14.7.1 Approval Wizard Updates the Work Order Client and Sub NTE</h3>
  <p>When a Work Order is created/updated from the Quote/Quote Manager, the Work Order&#39;s Sub NTE will be set from the sum of the Extended Costs on the approved Sub Scope lines. The Work Order&#39;s Client NTE will be set from the sum of the Extended Prices on the approved Scope lines, Revenue Adjustments not included. In previous releases, the Approval Wizard did not update the Work Order&#39;s Client NTE or Sub NTE. A registry is available to disable this behavior; see Customer Note 14.1.1.</p>
  <h3>14.7.2 Approval Wizard Sets Date Earliest Start</h3>
  <p>The Work Order&#39;s Date Earliest Start is now set to the current date when a new Work Order is generated from the Quote or Quote Manager&#39;s Approval Wizard. The Work Order&#39;s Date Earliest Start is also set to the current date if the Approval Wizard posts to an existing Work Order whose Date Earliest Start has not yet been set.</p>
  <h3>14.7.3 Approval Wizard Select Quote Documents Pane</h3>
  <p><span style="font-weight: bold;">New Buttons:</span>  Select All - Unselect All</p>
  <p>Clicking the Select All button selects all listed documents to be attached to the Work Order.  Clicking the Unselect All button clears the Ok box so that no Documents are selected.  Documents may be individual selected / unselected by double-clicking on the Ok box.</p>
  <h3>14.7.4 Approval Wizard Estimated Labor Cost</h3>
  <p>This release corrects an issue where the Quote Manager Approval Wizard zeroed out the Estimated Labor Cost (for budgeting) when writing to an existing Work Order with an Employee Technician.  In this release, the Quote Cost (from the Labor Rate referenced in the Scope&#39;s Labor lines) will be used to set the budgeted labor cost in Job History. As in previous releases, Job History is created for Quoted Work Order lines when the Work Order is marked Invoice Ready.</p>
  <h1>15 CRMAnywhere</h1>
  <h3>15.1 Opportunity Record</h3>
  <p><span style="font-weight: bold;">New Field: Opportunity Type</span><br/>
    This text field may be used to categorize this opportunity (e.g., Solar, Plumbing, Heating, etc.).</p>
  <p><span style="font-weight: bold;">New Field: Contact Type Id:</span><br/>
    This optional field defaults from the Contact record but may be changed by the user if needed.</p>
  <h3>15.1.1 New Tab - Contacts</h3>
  <p>This new tab enables multiple Contacts to be associated with an Opportunity. This tab is currently use for informational and custom report purposes only.</p>
  <p>
    <font style="font-weight: bold;">Contact Id:</font><br/>
    Enter a valid Contact Id (or double-click to select from a list). You may create as may lines as needed to accommodate all contacts. The display-only Name, Firm, Email and Phone number fields will default from the Contact record.
  </p>
  <p>
    <font style="font-weight: bold;">Contact Type Id:</font><br/>
    This optional field defaults from the Contact record but may be changed by the user if needed.

  <h2>15.2 Documents</h2>
  <p>Documents uploaded from CRMAnywhere now have their Web Viewable CRM flag set.<span style="font-weight: bold;"> </span></p>
  <h1>16 Service Management</h1>
  <h2>16.1 Registry</h2>
  <h3>16.1.1 Alert User if Active Quotes Exist for Selected Site in New Call</h3>
  <p>Active quotes are those which have not been fully approved (via the approval wizard) or declined.</p>
  <p><span style="font-weight: bold;">Registry Id:</span> sys-newcall</p>
  <p><span style="font-weight: bold;">Setting Key:</span> ShowActiveQuotesForClientSite   <span style="font-weight: bold;">Setting Value</span>: true (default false)</p>
  <p>If this registry is enabled, the following message will be displayed if any quotes with the Status Category of Active exist:</p>
  <p style="margin-left: 48px;">There are active quotes for the selected site. Would you like to view them?</p>
  <p style="margin-left: 8px;">If the user clicks Yes, a list of active quotes will be displayed; the user may access them if their security allows.  If the user clicks No, the message box will be closed.</p>
  <h3>16.1.1a New Call Option to Omit Market Source when Creating New Site/Client  Records</h3>
  <p>The following registry has been revised to omit writing the Market Source to the new Site and Client records. Previously, the Market Source was only omitted from the new Site.</p>
  <p>This registry entry impacts the New Call Create (flashlight) and New Call New COD screen where a new Client Site (and Client if applicable) are created along with the new Work Order.</p>
  <p><span style="font-weight: bold;">Id:</span> sys-newcall<br/>
    <span style="font-weight: bold;">Setting Key:</span> MarketSourceNoSite    <span style="font-weight: bold;">Setting Value:</span> true    (default false)
  </p>
  <p>If false or registry key is absent, continue to write the NewCall Market Source to the new Site and or Client and WO (default behavior).</p>
  <h3>16.1.1b New Call Option to Prevent a Work Order from Being Created to a Closed Job</h3>
  <p>Previously, the system would only warn the user when creating a work order for a piece of equipment referencing a closed job, yet still allow work order creation. A registry has been added to disallow users to create a work order referencing a closed job via the equipment default service job.</p>
  <p><span style="font-weight: bold;">Registry Id:</span> sys-newcall</p>
  <p><span style="font-weight: bold;">Setting Key:</span> ClosedJob   <span style="font-weight: bold;">Setting Value:</span> error    (default warning)</p>
  <p>When set to error, user will be unable to create work order. When set to warning, user is warned that creating a work order against a close job will lead to undesired results.</p>
  <h3>16.1.1c New Call Option to Clear Default Tech When Selecting Equipment</h3>
  <p>The following registry option causes the system to ignore the default technician specified in the Site or Equipment. <span style="font-weight: bold;">When it is enabled, the Technician Id will be set to blank (unassigned) when the Equipment is selected (regardless of whether it whether it was manually selected or defaulted).</span> <span style="text-decoration: underline; ">After</span> the equipment has been selected, the user may then enter the Technician Id or use TechFinder to do so.</p>
  <p><span style="font-weight: bold;">Id:</span> sys-newcall   </p>
  <p><span style="font-weight: bold;">Setting Key:</span> IgnoreDefaultTechFromClientSite   <span style="font-weight: bold;">Setting Value:</span> true  (default is false)</p>
  <h3>16.1.1d New Call option to Not Write to Status Pane on Mouse Move</h3>
  <p>This release supports a registry to disable writing to the New Call status pane when the mouse is moved. This has demonstrated some small improvement in New Call performance.</p>
  <p><span style="font-weight: bold;">Id:</span> sys-newcall</p>
  <p><span style="font-weight: bold;">Setting Key:</span> MouseMoveDisabledOnForms</p>
  <p><span style="font-weight: bold;">Setting Value:</span> form,form1,sidebar,topbar,sitesearch,wrkordr,clntste,clntsteeqpmnt</p>
  <p>The above setting value disables writing to the Status Pane when the mouse is over any of the New Call Panes.</p>
  <h3>16.1.1e Registry to prevent import of WorkOrder_Cllr from ServiceChannel</h3>
  <p>This update adds a registry to New Call to not import the ServiceChannel caller field into wrkordr_cllr when importing a ServiceChannel FMMS weblog.</p>
  <p><strong>Id:</strong> sys-fmms-vendor-ServiceChannel<br/>
    <strong>Setting Key:</strong> IncludeCallerInNewWorkOrder     <strong>Setting Value: </strong>false
  </p>
  <h3>16.1.1f Add warning if same Customer PO entered during New Call </h3>
  <p>This update adds the ability to the RequireUniquePO registry to view the existing work orders that have already been linked to the input Purchase Order. Before, the registry checked if a work order that has both the same Site and the same purchase order existed but could not allow the user to view the existing work orders.</p>
  <p><strong>Id:</strong> sys-newcall<br/>
    <strong>Setting Key:</strong> RequireUniquePO<strong>  Setting Value:</strong> true
  </p>
  <h3>16.1.2  Override NewWorkOrderStatus for Preventative Maintenance Work Orders</h3>
  <p>This registry should be set to enable Preventative Maintenance Work Orders (generated by Create PM Work Orders) to be assigned a special status when they are created even when NewWorkOrderStatus is set (which trumps the older StatusForPreventiveMaint registry option).</p>
  <p><span style="font-weight: bold;">Registry Id:</span> sys-web-access-none and sys-web-access-technician</p>
  <p><span style="font-weight: bold;">Setting Key:</span> OverrideNewWorkOrderStatus <span style="font-weight: bold;">Setting Value:</span> <span style="font-style: italic;">astatus</span></p>
  <h3>16.1.3 R<span style="font-style: italic;">e</span>gistry to Override Status of PM Work Orders With ReqResource Parts</h3>
  <p style="margin-left: 8px;"><span style="font-weight: bold;">Registry Id:</span> sys-start-scrtepmwo<br/>
    <span style="font-weight: bold;">Setting Key:</span> ReqPMPartsStatus    <span style="font-weight: bold;">Setting Value:</span> <span style="font-style: italic;">status</span>
  </p>
  <p style="margin-left: 8px;">By default, PM Work Orders which were generated with any ReqResource lines were ALWAYS set to Waiting Parts. This registry provides an override so that users can specify a different status for PM&#39;s with ReqResource parts.</p>
  <p style="margin-left: 48px;">Example: To set PM&#39;s with ReqResource lines to Waiting Service:</p>
  <p style="margin-left: 48px;">Id: sys-start-scrtepmwo<br/>
    Setting Key: ReqPMPartsStatus   Setting Value: Waiting Service</p>
  <h3>16.1.4 Registry to Default Service Account Manager from Site to PM Work Orders</h3>
  <p><span style="font-weight: bold;">Registry Id:</span> sys-start-scrtepmwo<br/>
    <span style="font-weight: bold;">Setting Key:</span> GetServiceAccountManagerFromClientSite    <span style="font-weight: bold;">Setting Value:</span> true     (default is false)<br/>
    If the above registry is enabled, Start Create PM Workorder will default the Service Account Manager from the Client Site only when Preventive Maintenance Work Orders are generated. If this registry is not enabled or the value is false then it will set the Service Account Manager first from the Client Site Equipment then from the Client Site, maintaining the previous default behavior.
  </p>
  <h3>16.1.4a Additional Sub/PO NTE Value in Create PM WOs for Master Contracts</h3>
  <p>This registry may be used to modify the calculation of the Sub NET / PO amount for Master Contract linked equipment. By default, when a PM Work Order is generated for a Subcontractor technician, the sub&#39;s NTE amount will be set to Cost amount on either the Inspections tab or the Provider Rates tab on the Master Contract record.</p>
  <p>In this release, the following registry modifies this; if the Master Contract does NOT have a Cost amount on either the Inspections tab or the Provider Rates tab, the Equipment record&#39;s Sub NTE will be used to set the Sub NTE on the Purchase Order and PM Work Order when Create PM Work Orders is run. This functionality requires that the PM is generated for a Subcontractor Tech.</p>
  <p><span style="font-weight: bold;">Id:</span> sys-start-scrtepmwo</p>
  <p><span style="font-weight: bold;">Setting Key:</span> LastResortSubNTE   <span style="font-weight: bold;">Setting Value:</span> equipment   </p>
  <h3>16.1.4b Include Site WO Other Tab Lines on PM Work Orders</h3>
  <p style="margin-left: 8px;">By default, entries on the Client Site WO Other tab are not added to Preventative Maintenance Work Orders created by Start Create PM Work Orders. The following registry may be implemented to add Client Site WO Other lines to Workorder Other Records when processing PM Workorders.</p>
  <p style="margin-left: 8px;"><span style="font-weight: bold;">Registry Id:</span> sys-start-scrtepmwo</p>
  <p style="margin-left: 8px;"><span style="font-weight: bold;">Setting Key:</span> ClientSiteWOOtherAdd   <span style="font-weight: bold;">Setting Value:</span> true (default is false)</p>
  <h3>16.1.4c OrderBy Option Supports Master Contract</h3>
  <p style="margin-left: 8px;">The OrderBy option now supports the inclusion of the Master Contract (mstrcntrct_id)..  </p>
  <p style="margin-left: 48px;"><span style="text-decoration: underline; ">Example:</span><br/>
    <font style="font-weight: bold;">Id:</font> sys-start-scrtepmwo<br/>
    <span style="font-weight: bold;">Setting Key:</span> OrderBy   <br/>
    <span style="font-weight: bold;">Setting Value:</span> mstrcntrct_id, clntste_id,clntsteeqpmntpm_dte_schdld_inspctn,tchncn_id,clntsteeqpmnt_id
  </p>
  <h3><b>16.1.4d Registry to Allow De-Selection of PM Work Order Lines</b></h3>
  <p>In this release, the user is not allowed to deselect lines associated with Master Contracts in the Create PM Workorders checklist. This change to default behavior was made to prevent issues with Time of Service Earned and Billed Master Contracts being improperly billed / earned because work orders for some equipment was not generated. This is now the default whether or not the new UseMasterContractEquipment global registry is enabled.</p>
  <p>The following registry may be implemented to enable the user to deselect lines associated with a Master Contract.  This registry is NOT recommended if Time of Service Earned or Time of Service Billed Master Contracts are implemented.</p>
  <p><b>Id:</b> sys-start-scrtepmwo <b>Setting Key:</b>  VisitsCanBeDeselected  <b>Setting Value:</b> true (default false)</p>
  <h3>16.1.5  Work Order Registry to Deny Manual Entry of Negative Inventory Lines</h3>
  <p><span style="font-weight: bold;">Registry Id:</span> sys-viewer-vwrkordr</p>
  <p><span style="font-weight: bold;">Setting Key:</span> AllowNegativeInventoryQuantity</p>
  <p><span style="font-weight: bold;">Setting Values:</span> false    (default true)</p>
  <p>Implementing this registry setting prevents the user from manually entering negative Inventory lines on the Work Order Inventory tab.  Typically, this would be enabled to require IM ADJUSTMENT transactions to be made to &quot;return&quot; items to a stocking location.  Ideally, the Return Wizard process to would be used to do so. This type of transaction influences the Average Cost Calculation whereas direct WO Inventory activity does not.</p>
  <p style="margin-left: 48px;"><span style="font-weight: bold;">WARNING:</span> As of this release, this new option is applied to both the Actual and the Billable quantities.  With the new option enabled one cannot give a billing credit (negative Billable Qty) to adjust and/or correct an invoice.</p>
  <h3>16.1.6 New Call Registry for Default Service Job Selection Filter Override</h3>
  <p>By default, when the user double-clicks New Call&#39;s Default Service Job field, the system filters the list to jobs belonging to the selected Site. The following registry (in conjunction with Service Category settings)  provides a mechanism to over-ride the New Call&#39;s determination for how to filter the &quot;Default Service Job&quot; selection pick-list. For example, Equipment with a Service Category of UTILITY could be set to filter to a special utility job or jobs not connected to the specific Site.</p>
  <p style="margin-left: 48px;"><span style="font-weight: bold;">Warranty Jobs:</span><br/>
    This registry could also be used to expedite the selection of Warranty jobs in New Call. For example, different Warranty Jobs for the Service Category HVAC could be set up Carrier, Trane, and so on. In this case, the Job Type in these Warranty Jobs would be set to HVAC.  The Job Type in the regular Jobs would NOT be set to HVAC.</p>
  <p style="font-weight: bold;">Registry To Specify the Service Category Field to Filter On</p>
  <p><span style="font-weight: bold;">Id:</span> sys-newcall</p>
  <p><span style="font-weight: bold;">Setting Key:</span> JobFilterByServiceCategory  <span style="font-weight: bold;">Setting Value:</span> User5 (User1 - 4 also supported)</p>
  <p>The Setting Value specifies which of the Service Category User fields will contain the SQL statement to control the filtering. In the above example, User5 is specified, but User1, User2, User3 and User4 are also supported.</p>
  <p style="font-weight: bold;">Service Category</p>
  <p><span style="font-weight: bold;">Service Category User1-5</span><br/>
    This field may be used for overriding the Job filtering in New Call. The field value must be set as necessary for each individual Service Category that has special job filtering requirements.  For example, to specify the Job filtering for the selected Service Category to use the specific Job Type of UTL, the field would be completed as follows (note that the Job Type Id is single-quoted):   jbtype_id=&#39;UTL&#39;</p>
  <p style="margin-left: 48px;"><span style="font-weight: bold;">Tip: Relabel the Service Category User Field</span><br/>
    The Custom Fields functionality may be used to relabel the User field used for the Job filtering override (e.g., Job Type Filter).</p>
  <p style="margin-left: 8px; font-weight: bold;">Job:</p>
  <p style="margin-left: 8px;">For those Jobs you wish to enable for Job Filter overrides in New Call, set the field specified in the Service Category User field.  In our example, the Job&#39;s Job Type would be set to UTL.</p>
  <p style="margin-left: 8px; font-weight: bold;">New Call:</p>
  <p style="margin-left: 8px;">In this scenario, suppose a user selects Equipment belonging to Service Category Utility in New Call. Initially, the Default Service Job will default from the Equipment record. However, double-clicking on the Default Service Job displays a list of Jobs whose Job Type is set to UTL instead of Job for the selected Site. Note that the user may manually enter any valid Job Id. This functionality ONLY impacts the filtering of the Job list.</p>
  <h3>16.1.7 Disable Use of Equipment Service Task when Master Contract PM&#39;s are Created</h3>
  <p>The default behavior for version 9.1 is that, if the PM Task List Id not specified on the PM Master Contract schedule line, the system now looks to see if there is one specified in the Client Site Equipment. This task will be defaulted to the Client Site Equipment PM line and PM Work Order. This enhancement allows for different task lists to be assigned by equipment scheduled.</p>
  <p><span style="font-weight: normal;">In previous versions of 9.1, there was no way of changing the default behavior. In this release, the following registry may be implemented to disable the default behavior; if it is set, the Equipment&#39;s Service Task will NOT be used if the Master Contract Schedule&#39;s Service Task is blank.</span></p>
  <p><span style="font-weight: bold;">Registry Id:</span> sys-ffv-global-settings</p>
  <p><span style="font-weight: bold;">Setting Key:</span> disableUseEquipmentHeaderServiceTasks  <span style="font-weight: bold;">Setting Value:</span> true  (Default false)</p>
  <h3>16.1.8 Prevent User from Editing WO Other Tab Lines Imported from a PO</h3>
  <p>If the user changes the description of a Gen Item after it is imported into the WO from a source PO a disconnect is created when running Create EOM Unvouchered AP GL Entries (seomunvchrdap). Those changed lines will not be included in the GL Journal written by the function.</p>
  <p>A registry has been added to prevent these lines from being changed on the Work Order&#39;s Other tab. If the following registry is implemented, the system will display an error message if the user attempts to change the description on an Other tab line associated with a PO and imported from JCH. Note that the Setting Value is false to implement this behavior.</p>
  <p><span style="font-weight: bold;">Registry Id:</span> sys-viewer-vwrkordr</p>
  <p><span style="font-weight: bold;">Setting Key:</span> AllowEditOfPOGENDescriptions   </p>
  <p><span style="font-weight: bold;">Setting Value:</span> false  (Default is true to preserve current behavior)</p>
  <h3>16.1.8a Consolidate Imported Job History Records When Get Costs is Clicked in WO</h3>
  <p>With the following registry in place, costs previously imported from JCH into the Work Order Viewer are evaluated and “refreshed” or consolidated to decrease the amount of negative/reversing lines on the WO child tabs.</p>
  <p><span style="font-weight: bold;">Id:</span> sys-viewer-vwrkordr</p>
  <p><span style="font-weight: bold;">Setting Key:</span> ImportCostsRefreshAll   <span style="font-weight: bold;">Setting Value:</span> always or prompt or no   (default no)</p>
  <p>The default setting is &#39;no&#39;.  This preserves the existing behavior.</p>
  <p>The preferred setting is &#39;Always&#39;.  With this option in place, each time Get Costs is hit all WO lines previously imported from Job Cost History are removed from the viewer and evaluated along with any new costs coming in. Any old, and new lines that net to zero are eliminated. Old and new lines that are eligible for collapsing will be brought in as one newly revised WO line.</p>
  <p>The &#39;Prompt&#39; option gives the user the option of whether to consolidate with the following question:    </p>
  <p style="margin-left: 48px;">“Do you want to consolidate imported cost records?<br/>
    Yes to consolidate. No to import without consolidating.”</p>
  <p>*Note – separate transactions may not always consolidate depending on differences in data entry between the two transactions.</p>
  <p><span style="text-decoration: underline; ">Example:</span></p>
  <p>A Labor journal entry is imported into a work order, and saved after import. The same labor journal is then decreased by two hours, and Get Costs is hit on the work order.</p>
  <p style="margin-left: 48px;">With registry set to <span style="font-weight: bold;">always</span>, the original import is deleted from the work order and one line will be brought in with reduced amount.</p>
  <p style="margin-left: 48px;">With registry set to <span style="font-weight: bold;">prompt,</span> answer Yes for same result above, answer No and three lines are brought in - the original, the reversal and the new.</p>
  <p style="margin-left: 8px;">The example above is always eligible for collapse because it is from the same transaction. Separate transactions may not always qualify for collapse if for example, a description, date, cost category, etc. is different between the two. Keep this in mind when using this registry.</p>
  <h5>16.1.8b Prompt for Importing Revenue Adjustments when if the Work Order has NOT been Quoted</h5>
  <p>The Work Order&#39;s Get Costs function now works differently depending on whether or not it has been quoted. The decision as to whether or not a WO has been quoted looks for Quote Scope records with a status of Accepted or Approved.  It also restricts the list to only those Scopes that are for the WO currently in the viewer.  </p>
  <p>The following registry may be implemented to prompt the user if they wish to import revenue adjustments when importing costs to a Work Order that is <span style="font-weight: bold;">not</span> associated with a Quote. If the user clicks Yes (to import revenue adjustments), it will have the same result as clicking the Adjust Revenue button on the Gross Margin tab.</p>
  <p style="font-weight: bold;">Registry:</p>
  <p><span style="font-weight: bold;">Id:</span> sys-viewer-vwrkordr</p>
  <p><span style="font-weight: bold;">Setting Key:</span> PromptForRevenueAdjustmentsWhenImportingCosts  <span style="font-weight: bold;">Setting Value:</span> true (default false)</p>
  <h5>16.1.8c Registry to Include Equipment Information When Build Description Button is Clicked</h5>
  <p><span style="font-weight: bold;">Id:</span> sys-viewer-vwrkordr</p>
  <p><span style="font-weight: bold;">Setting Key:</span> InvoiceDetails     <span style="font-weight: bold;">Setting Value:</span> equipment OR components (default is absence of registry)</p>
  <p>If this registry is not set (and the user is not using a v.cus file to implement the special functionality) the Build Invoice Description button will populate the Invoice Description of Work Performed field with the Work Performed text from all lines on the Equipment tab.</p>
  <p>If the Setting Value is set to <span style="font-weight: bold;">equipment</span>, the Work Performed for each line will be preceded by the Equipment Name, Manufacturer, Model and Serial Number.</p>
  <p><span style="font-weight: normal;">If the Setting Value is set to </span><span style="font-weight: bold;">components</span><span style="font-weight: normal;">, the Invoice Description of Work Performed field will be populated as follows from each Equipment line: the Equipment Id, the list of the Equipment&#39;s Components, the Equipment Name, the Manufacturer, Model and Serial Number, and finally the Work Performed.</span></p>
  <h3>16.1.9 Registry to Add/Change Statuses in Start Work Order Batch Close</h3>
  <p>A new registry is available to specify the status eligible for Start Work Order Batch Close. By default, only Work Orders with Technician lines set to Billed or Cancelled are eligible for this function. The following registry overrides this.</p>
  <p><span style="font-weight: bold;"><span style="font-weight: bold;">I</span>d:</span> sys-start-swrkordrbtchclse</p>
  <p><span style="font-weight: bold;">Setting Key:</span> ClosedTypesList  <span style="font-weight: bold;">Setting Value:</span> <span style="font-style: italic;">list of tech statues</span></p>
  <p style="font-weight: bold; margin-left: 48px; text-decoration: underline; ">Example:</p>
  <p style="margin-left: 48px;">Setting Key: ClosedTypesList  Setting Value: cancelled,billed,no bill,tech declined</p>
  <p style="margin-left: 48px;">Note that the default statuses of cancelled or billed must be included in the registry for them to be eligible to be closed.</p>
  <h3>16.1.10 Registry to add Work Code Certifications to TechFinder</h3>
  <p style="margin-left: 8px;">This release supports additional Certifications to be specified for use with TechFinder.  When the following registry entry is enabled, a comma-delimited list of Certification Ids in the Work Code User1 field will be added to the Certification Id range field when TechFinder is launched from New Call or the SAMPro Dispatch board. This list will be appended to the list from the selected Site and Equipment records.</p>
  <p style="margin-left: 8px;">Note that when TechFinder is launched from the Dispatch Board, the Work Code on the Work Order&#39;s Main tab will be evaluated for Certifications.</p>

  <h3>16.1.11 Registry to Specify Which Lines from the Site WO Other Tab Should be Added Based on the Work Order&#39;s Service Category</h3>
  <p>This registry is currently supported by SAMPro&#39;s New Call, Project Work Order Generator and Work Orders generated by TechAnywhere.  </p>
  <p><span style="font-weight: bold;">Id:</span> sys-behavior-ClientSiteWOOther</p>
  <p><span style="font-weight: bold;">Setting Key:</span> <span style="font-style: italic;">OtherRateId</span>   <span style="font-weight: bold;">Setting Value:</span> ExceptFor:<span style="font-style: italic;">servicecategory1,servicecatory2,...</span></p>
  <p>or</p>
  <p><span style="font-weight: bold;">Setting Key:</span> <span style="font-style: italic;">OtherRateId</span>   <span style="font-weight: bold;">Setting Value:</span> <span style="font-style: italic;">OnlyFor:servicecategory1,servicecatory2,...</span></p>
  <p>In this registry, the Setting Key is the Other Rate Id.  The Setting Value specifies the option (OnlyFor: or ExceptFor:) followed by a list of the Service Categories the Other Rate pertains to. If an Other Rate if not defined in this registry, it will continue to be added to Work Orders to maintain default behavior.</p>
  <p>The OnlyFor: option defines which Work Orders (by Service Category) will have will have a Work Order Other line generated from the Site&#39;s WO Other tab.</p>
  <p>The ExceptFor: option is used to specify Service Categories should be excluded from this line.</p>
  <p style="margin-left: 48px; text-decoration: underline; ">Examples:</p>

  <p style="margin-left: 48px;">Setting Key  Truck   Setting Value:ExceptFor: NETWORK</p>
  <p style="margin-left: 48px;">In this example, a Site could include the Trip1, Trip2 and Truck Other Rates.  However, the Service Category of the Work Order would determine which would be added to the Work Order Other tab.</p>
  <p style="margin-left: 48px;"><span style="text-decoration: underline; ">Results:</span></p>

  <h3>16.1.12 Classic Dispatch Board Registry To Correct Last Tech Column</h3>
  <p>In certain installations, the Classic Dispatch Boards may display with the last technician column twice. If this occurs, the following registry setting may be enabled to force a redraw of the last quarter of the classic board to prevent the problem. This may result in additional flashing during the redraw, so this registry should only be implemented if the problem exists and it bothers the users.</p>
  <p><span style="font-weight: bold;">Registry Id:</span> sys-viewer-vdsptchbrd</p>
  <p><span style="font-weight: bold;">Setting Key:</span> useCase8798code  <span style="font-weight: bold;">Setting Value:</span> true   (default is false)</p>
  <h3>16.1.13 Dispatch Board - Disable Edit Daily WO Button</h3>
  <p>The following registry disables the Edit Daily WO&#39;s button on the Dispatch Board&#39;s top button bar:</p>
  <p><span style="font-weight: bold;">Id:</span> sys-viewer-vdsptchbrd</p>
  <p><span style="font-weight: bold;">Setting Key:</span> DisabledFieldstopbar  <span style="font-weight: bold;">Setting Value:</span> push-editDailyWOsTop</p>
  <p>This release corrects a spurious warning (Registry Key disabledfieldtopbar refers to view (topbar) that is not a valid field new) if the above registry was set, and you entered the dispatch board through View Dispatch Board (Records list) or the folder structure (Service Management module, Dispatching tab, &#39;Dispatching board&#39; button).  This release supports the option to disable Edit Daily WOs button on top of DBoard no matter how the Dispatch Board is accessed.</p>
  <h3>16.1.14 Registry Updates</h3>
  <p>When registries to enable master client site equipment tables are activated, the association with what equipment is covered was broken. This update corrects this defect.</p>
  <h2>16.2 Reports</h2>
  <h3>16.2.1 Work Order Field Ticket Standard (woticket-db.rpt)</h3>
  <p>The revised report dated 2016-02-25 adds an option to Skip PO Summary. In addition, Multi-page textbox processing was added for the Work Requested field.  </p>
  <h3>16.2.2 Report PM WorkOrder List</h3>
  <p>This release plus the revised Report PM WorkOrder List (RPMWRKORDRLST.rpt) dated 2017-09-12 supports the OrderBy registry (if present) for the function Start Create PM Work Orders (sys-start-scrtepmwo).  This means that the function&#39;s checklist and the report will appear in the same order.</p>
  <p style="font-weight: bold;">Important Note to Sybase Users:</p>
  <p>If the Client Site Equipment&#39;s Inspection Date is referenced in the OrderBy statement, its database name must be entered as <span style="font-weight: bold;">c</span>lntsteeqpmntpm.clntsteeqpmntpm_dte_schdld_inspctn <span style="font-weight: bold;">instead of</span> clntsteeqpmntpm_dte_schdld_inspctn to prevent a Sybase error -144 column not found error when the report is run.</p>
  <p>Id: sys-start-scrtepmwo</p>
  <p>Setting Key: OrderBy<br/>
    Setting Value: clntste_id,clntsteeqpmntpm.clntsteeqpmntpm_dte_schdld_inspctn,tchncn_id,clntsteeqpmnt_id</p>
  <h3><span style="font-weight: bold;">16.2.3 Report Site Service History</span></h3>
  <p>The revised report (RSRVCEHSTRYDTL.rpt) dated 2017-10-04 includes a new range filter, Equipment Type Id.</p>
  <h3>16.2.4 Report Refrigerant Usage</h3>
  <p>The revised Report Refrigerant Usage (RRFRGRNTUSGE.rpt) dated 2020-12-14 has been revamped to properly process multiple Refrigerant Tracking History events on a single Work Order.</p>
  <h2>16.3 Work Order</h2>
  <p>Previously a change from versions 9.1.611.061 and 9.1.611.062 caused the Equipment ID from the Workorder Equipment tab to not populate into lines being entered on the Inventory, Labor, or Other tabs. This update corrects this defect. </p>
  <p>Previously, when the focus was on the Labor Tab line #1, it lost field value and updated to 0. That update carried through to the JCH posting effectively eliminating hours that were posted from a Labor Journal Transaction. This update corrects this defect. </p>
  <p>Previously when editing the Flat Rate Labor Unit Cost, the updated cost would not appear updated on a new work order without closing the work order viewer first. This is due to the Flat Rate information being cached when the Work Order is opened. This update corrects this defect. </p>
  <p>Previously when receipts were posted with apostrophe characters, the work order was unable to load without presenting an error due to a query that attempted to populate references on the COD tab of the work order. This update corrects this defect. </p>
  <p>When Intercompany is enabled and a detail line contains a Job Id, any changes to the line&#39;s GL Entity are validated to ensure that the new GL Entity belongs to the same company as the Job.</p>
  <p>This release provides a performance enhancement when opening Work Orders when the sys-viewer-vwrkordr registry&#39;s option GrossMarginFromJobHistory is enabled.</p>
  <p>Corrects a &quot;key is missing&quot; error which occurred when a work order was saved immediately after being opened.</p>
  <p>Corrects a sporadic issue if a user attempted to edit a previously invoiced line resulting in negative &#39;ghost&#39; lines on subsequent invoices for that Work Order.</p>
  <p>Imported Material and Other lines now retain their Job information even when DefaultJobByEquipmentId is enabled.</p>
  <p>The Gross Margin is no longer calculated if the Work Order or Job Id is empty to improve time loading the empty Work Order viewer.</p>
  <p>This update corrects security for intercompany IMH postings from WO Inventory when the location assigned to the WO Inventory does not belong to same company as the actual WO. </p>
  <h3>16.3.1 Work Order Labor Tab</h3>
  <p><span style="font-weight: bold;">Quoted Lines:</span> Previously, entering a labor budget on the Labor Tab by checking lines as &#39;quoted&#39;, resulted in the quoted line posting to GL when the WO was marked as Invoice Ready. In this release, the system never posts to GL for quote-type WO Labor lines.</p>
  <p>
    <font style="font-weight: bold;">Labor Tab Header:</font> The Actual Hours: Billable Hours: fields display a running total of hours entered on the Work Order. Negative labor hours are now subtracted from these running totals instead of being added.  
  </p>
  <p><span style="font-weight: bold;">PR-to-GL Accruals:</span> In previous releases, accruals were skipped for Standard Cost type Earnings record when an Overhead Jobs was specified. In this release, accruals are correctly posted for Standard Cost Earnings for Jobs that are not Direct.</p>
  <p><span style="font-weight: bold;">Changed Field: Cost Category</span><br/>
    This field now supports enhanced filtering provided by the Cost Code&#39;s Job Cost Category Usage Filter. Cost Categories are validated (relative to Cost Codes) during data entry upon leaving the Cost Category Id field.  The full relationship is validated again when leaving a child line or saving a record.</p>
  <p><span style="font-weight: bold;">New Field (Magnify view) - Supervisor Id:</span><br/>
    If completed, this field specifies the Supervisor responsible for the work in this entry.  </p>
  <h3>16.3.2 Work Order Find Data / Filter Range Viewer</h3>
  <p>Job Type has been added as a new filter range option. This lets users filter Work Orders by the Type of Job in the Work Order header.</p>
  <p>When searching for WO Techs with the WorkOrdersByBranchIDByWorkOrderID&#39; list selected, only the Primary Tech is actually searched for. The Primary Tech has been added to this list to help avoid confusion.</p>
  <p>The Date Scheduled Range has been relabeled as Original Date Scheduled to clarify its function.</p>
  <h3>16.3.3 Invoice Description of Work Performed (Invoice Tab)</h3>
  <p>This field has been expanded from 3000 to 6000 characters.</p>
  <p><img alt="" border="0" src="assets/images/image/BuildDescription.gif" style="border: none;"/>  </p>
  <p>In previous releases, it was possible for the total # of character across several WO Equip – Work Performed field to exceed the character limit of Invoice Description of Work Performed. In this release, when the Build Description button is clicked, if the system detects that the resultant string will exceed 6000 characters the user will be alerted and offering the choice to “paste anyway?”</p>
  <p style="margin-left: 48px;">Yes will move the text (truncation will result as always has). Selecting No will cancel the operation.</p>
  <p style="margin-left: 48px;">When No is selected the user will have the opportunity to populate Invoice Description of Work Performed with some standard language such as “Details by Equipment to follow…”.</p>
  <p style="margin-left: 8px;">To include all of the WO Equipment Work Performed on the invoice, the Equipment Work Performed Addendum - Show on Invoice? box should be checked.</p>
  <p><span style="font-weight: bold;">New Field: Equipment Work Performed Addendum - Show on Invoice?</span><br/>
    When this box is checked, the revised Service Invoice (SERVICEINVOICEv90_b002.rpt revised 2015-11-02) will continue to print the Invoice Description of Work Performed. In addition, a page break AFTER the Invoice Total/AR Summary will occur and additional (addendum) page(s) will print as necessary to present the COMPLETE – Work Performed text associated to EACH WO Equipment record on the work order.</p>
  <p style="margin-left: 8px;">Note that if the Show Equipment Detail box is flagged when printing the invoice, the Equipment Work Performed will be listed in the body of the WO as well. Typically, this option would NOT be used in conjunction with the new  &quot;Equipment Work Performed Addendum - Show on Invoice&quot; functionality.</p>
  <h3>16.3.4 Work Order Inventory Tab</h3>
  <p style="margin-left: 8px; font-weight: bold;"><span style="font-weight: normal;">If an Inventory line flagged as &#39;Extra&#39; is added to a Preventative Maintenance Work Order, the AR Invoice Id will not be written to Job History based on the PM Invoice Id being completed in the Work Order.  This allows these lines to be billed separately on the Preventive Maintenance Work Order apart from the existing PM Invoice.</span></p>
  <p style="margin-left: 8px; font-weight: bold;">Price Level: <span style="font-weight: normal;">Previously, when the Price Level was changed, the Revenue Rate was recomputed for Unit Price items but the screen was not refreshed to show this data. This display issue has been corrected.</span></p>
  <p style="margin-left: 8px;"><span style="font-weight: bold;">Changed Field: Cost Category</span><br/>
    This field now supports enhanced filtering provided by the Cost Code&#39;s Job Cost Category Usage Filter. Cost Categories are validated (relative to Cost Codes) during data entry upon leaving the Cost Category Id field.  The full relationship is validated again when leaving a child line or saving a record.</p>
  <p style="margin-left: 8px;">The rules regarding allowed Cost Category Selection Types have changed as follows on this tab:</p>

  <h3>16.3.4a Work Order Inventory Tab</h3>
  <p>Customizations available with this release correct a display issue when the vertical lines that separate the Revenue Rate, Unit Cost, and Cost Category disappeared, except for the line containing the cursor. A new v.cus file will be required to see this correction; standard customizations are included with this release; contact your support rep a company-specific customization is needed.</p>
  <h3>16.3.4b  Inventory Price Level</h3>
  <p>This release updates the setting of the Inventory Price Level to make the Work Order and Quote Scope Inventory tabs more consistent. The hierarchy in the current release follows:</p>
  <p style="font-weight: bold;">Quote Scope:</p>
  <p>If the Quote references a Site (but not a Job), the Site&#39;s Price Level is used as in previous releases.<br/>
    If the Quote references a Job, the Job&#39;s Price Level is used (previously the Site was always used).<br/>
    When the Job &amp; Site Levels are both blank use the Price Level 1.</p>
  <p style="font-weight: bold;">Work Order Inventory:</p>
  <p>When both the Job &amp; Site have a Price Level use the Job Level (same as previous)<br/>
    When the Job Level is blank, use the Site Level (same as previous)<br/>
    When the Job &amp; Site Levels are both blank use the Work Order Price Level which defaults to 1 in this scenario</p>
  <p>This is also supported for Price Code exceptions.</p>
  <p style="font-weight: bold;">Work Order Invoicing Tab</p>
  <p><span style="font-weight: bold;">Changed Field: Mat Price Level &gt; Site Price Level</span><br/>
    The display-only Mat Price Lvl field on the Work Order&#39;s Invoicing tab has been changed to Site Price Level to better define it&#39;s source. Note that if the Material Price Level is defined in the Job, it will be used instead of the Site&#39;s Price Level with detail lines are added to the Work Order.</p>
  <h3>16.3.4 Work Order Other Tab</h3>
  <p>Lines for Fixed Fee Billing Items (for Use Tax Jobs) flagged as Extra now have the Use tax factored in when the Revenue is calculated. The Tax Cost is also set when a Standard Cost Other Rate is selected.</p>
  <p><span style="font-weight: bold;">Changed Field: Asset Id:</span><span> Entering/Changing an Asset Id properly loads the Asset&#39;s Other Rate and populates the Description field. Clearing the Asset Id does not auto-load or clear existing Other Rates and related data.</span></p>
  <p style="margin-left: 8px;"><span style="font-weight: bold;">Changed Field: Cost Category</span><br/>
    This field now supports enhanced filtering provided by the Cost Code&#39;s Job Cost Category Usage Filter. Cost Categories are validated (relative to Cost Codes) during data entry upon leaving the Cost Category Id field.  The full relationship is validated again when leaving a child line or saving a record.</p>
  <p style="margin-left: 8px;">The rules regarding allowed Cost Category Selection Types have changed as follows on this tab:</p>

    These user-defined fields have been added to the Magnify view of the Work Order Other tab.</p>
  <h3>16.3.4a Unit Price Calculations with Canadian PST</h3>
  <p><span style="font-weight: bold;">Changed Field: Unit Price</span><br/>
    This release corrects the calculation of the Unit Price in the specific scenario where the Bill Quantity was edited to a different value than the Actual Quantity for lines where there is a &quot;tax cost&quot; to be included in the basis of calculating the Unit Price. This issue primarily impacts situations such as calculating the Canadian PST as an additional cost on a line to be included in pricing mark-up. When adjusting the Unit Cost to include Tax Cost on the Work Order Other tab, the system now uses the Actual Qty, not the Billable Qty.</p>
  <h3>16.3.4b WO Other Tab Credit GL Entity</h3>
  <p>This release revises the hierarchy for setting the credit-side GL Entity using the first non-blank GL Entity Id from:</p>
  <p>1.) Asset Id&#39;s OH Job Cost Code GL Entity</p>
  <p>2.) Registry UseDefaultBalanceSheetGLEntity   ***see note below</p>
  <p>3.) Other Rate Credit GL Entity</p>
  <p>4.) Company Default GL Entity</p>
  <p>*** If &quot;UseDefaultBalanceSheetGLEntity&quot; = true/enabled; but &quot;DefaultBalanceSheetEntity&quot; value is not defined, blank or disabled....then Company Record Default GL Entity behaves as a STAND-IN as value.</p>
  <h3>16.3.5 Work Order Revenue Adjustment Tab</h3>
  <p style="margin-left: 8px;"><span style="font-weight: bold;">Changed Field: Cost Category</span><br/>
    This field now supports enhanced filtering provided by the Cost Code&#39;s Job Cost Category Usage Filter. Cost Categories are validated (relative to Cost Codes) during data entry upon leaving the Cost Category Id field.  The full relationship is validated again when leaving a child line or saving a record.</p>
  <h3>16.3.6 Work Order Required Resources Tab</h3>
  <p><span style="font-weight: bold;">Location Id and Vendor Id Validation:</span><br/>
    In previous releases, validation did not allow a Location and Vendor to be entered manually on the same line. However, if the user ran the RR Wizard but cleared the OK box at the end (so that the PO was not created), both the Location (defaulted from the Wizard) and Vendor were entered. In this release, the validation has been refined to allow the User to clear the Vendor or Location if both have been completed and the line has not been requisitioned.  </p>
  <p style="margin-left: 8px;"><span style="font-weight: bold;">Changed Field: Cost Category</span><br/>
    This field now supports enhanced filtering provided by the Cost Code&#39;s Job Cost Category Usage Filter. Cost Categories are validated (relative to Cost Codes) during data entry upon leaving the Cost Category Id field.  The full relationship is validated again when leaving a child line or saving a record.</p>

  <p>In version 9.1.611.060 and up, this patch corrects an issue where manual adjustments to the Work Order Revenue Adjustments tab&#39;s Rate field did not properly update the Amount field the Rate included a percentage point.  The patch corrects this by copying the Rate field before dividing by 100 to prevent truncation of decimal points.</p>
  <h3>16.3.7 Work Order Main Tab</h3>
  <p>Previously, when a user had a Gross Margin tab open and made changes to the Labor, Inventory, or Other tabs and save, the Gross Margin tab did not display the changes made. This update corrects this defect. </p>
  <p>The Email address from the Site&#39;s upper Contacts tab is now displayed below the Site&#39;s Phone and Fax numbers.</p>
  <p><span style="font-weight: bold;">Changed Field - Sub NTE:</span><br/>
    The Field Label &#39;Sub NTE&#39; has been changed to &#39;Sub/PO NTE&#39; to better define it&#39;s meaning.</p>
  <p><span style="font-weight: bold;">Changed Field - Work Requested:</span><br/>
    This field has been expanded from 3000 to 6000 characters.</p>
  <p><span style="font-weight: bold;">Master Contract Id:</span> (requires a special v.cus file to display this field)<br/>
    This field will be completed for Work Orders associated with Master Contracts when Create PM Work Order and Create PM Billing is run. It will also be set from New Call if the selected Equipment is associated with a Master Contract that is currently open or will be open in the future. This field supports custom reporting/analysis of full service contracts.</p>
  <p><span style="font-weight: bold;">New Field: Email Address</span><br/>
    When a Site is selected in New Call, the Client Site&#39;s Email field is now defaulted to the Work Order Email field. The user may manually update this field if desired before adding the Work Order. Escalations for the new Notification Source &#39;Work Order&#39; will be sent to this address.</p>
  <p>The Email address for the Scheduled Events is set when the WO is generated. Changing it in the Work Order after creation will not propagate the change to the Events themselves. See Customer Note 16.10.2 for additional information concerning this field.</p>

  <p>The following fields have been repositioned on the Main tab to minimize scrolling on the wider screen monitors employed by most SAMPro user:</p>
  <p>Moved from near the bottom of the Main tab to just below the Original WO field in the third column of fields:</p>
  <p style="margin-left: 48px;">Account Manager Id, Sales Manager Id, Dispatcher Id:</p>
  <p>Display Fields moved from below the Original WO to the fourth column below the Return to Inventory button:</p>
  <p style="margin-left: 48px;">Esc. Profile Id, Gross Margin Id, Rate Schedule Id:</p>
  <p>The Security Id and Company Id have been moved from near the bottom of the Main tab to the left of the Return to Inventory button.</p>
  <h5>16.3.7.2 Work Order Main Tab XOi Link</h5>

		 border-top-width: 1px; border-right-width: 1px; border-bottom-width: 1px; 
		 background-color: #808080;"/> To further the SAMPro-TechAnywhere/XOi integration, an Open XOi Vision Info link button has been added to the Work Order&#39;s Main tab. When clicked, this button will launch a link/URL (with the use&#39;s default browser) to XOi&#39;s page, to display XOi &quot;Jobs&quot; linked to the selected Work Order (these are not SAMPro Jobs).This release allows the user to view Public (customer facing) or Full (contractor facing) data from this link. Previously only Public content was displayed.</p>
  <p>The user will be alerted if XOi is implemented but XOi &quot;Jobs&quot; are not associated with this Work Order. If XOi is not implemented, nothing will happen when the button is clicked. This functionality is supported in MS SQL installations.</p>
  <p><span style="font-weight: bold;">Implementation Details:</span></p>
  <p>The way this works is that SAMPro will talk with Sampro Secure Communication on a local GlassFish/Payara web server. Sampro Secure Communication will then talk to DBXchange. DBXchange to XOi, and then back down the chain to SAMPro. This will require the following setup:</p>
  <p>1. Installation/upgrade of the latest SamproSecureCommunication WAR file. It can be found in the usual location \\shares\FTP Updates\SAMPro Secure Communication\ . The SamproSecureCommunication2.1.zip or above is required.</p>
  <p> 2. Installation of DBXchange (this should be in place because this integration is used for TechAnywhere).</p>
  <p><span style="font-weight: bold;">Registry:</span></p>

  <p style="margin-left: 48px;"><span style="font-weight: bold;">Important:</span> The registry entries for sys-dbxchange are cached and only take effect after logging out of SAMPro and back in.</p>
  <h3><span style="font-weight: bold;">16.3.8 Work Order Import Flat Rate</span></h3>
  <p>If the registry DeferTaxStatusDecision is set to true, the Flat Rate Revenue line imports correctly. Previously, only the costs were imported.</p>

  <h3>16.3.10 Work Order Equipment Tab</h3>
  <p>Version 9.1.611.058 corrects a spurious &quot;Registry entry Error no such field exists&quot; when right-click opening a list of Equipment. This release fixes the issue with registry entries for both <i style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 0.9);

  <p><span style="font-weight: bold;">Changed Field - Cycle Code Filter:</span> When manually adding a line, the Cycle Code&#39;s &#39;CC&#39; filter is now pulled from the line&#39;s Work Code to filter the Metrics lines that are automatically added. This release correctly sets the Cycle Code Filter when Equipment is manually added with a Work Code referencing a Cycle Code. This will prevent TechAnywhere sync issues resulting from an incorrectly formatted filter.  </p>
  <p><span style="font-weight: bold;">Changed Field - Work Requested:</span><br/>

  <h3>16.3.11 New Work Order Tab: Milestones</h3>
  <p>The Milestones Tab was initially designed to be populated the Project Work Order Generator. This release allows Milestones to be added to any Work Order for reporting purposes.</p>
  <p style="margin-left: 48px;"><span style="font-weight: bold;">Tip:</span> If using the Milestones on a manually created Work Order, first set the Date Must Complete and the Time Must Complete and SAVE the Work Order before added the Milestones. The Milestone&#39;s End Date/Time are controlled by the Days/Time Offset fields and the Work Order&#39;s Date/Time must complete.</p>
  <p style="margin-left: 8px;">Also in this release, if the user changes the Milestone&#39;s End Date/Time, the Days/Time Offset fields will automatically be updated (if the Fixed Date / Time boxes are not checked).</p>
  <p style="margin-left: 8px;">See Customer Note 16.17.4 for additional information on using this tab.</p>
  <h3>16.3.12 Work Order Technician Tab</h3>
  <p><span>In SAMPro 9.1.611.061 and above, this update adds an &quot;<a href="Work_Order_Technicians.htm#UpdateTechStatus">UpdateTechStatus</a>&quot; as a new option/button that can be launched from the left-hand side of the Work Order Viewer. When selected, a modal window will display with two input fields: “From” and “To.” If all tech lines on a work order have the same status, the From field will be pre-populated with the status. Otherwise, a drop-down list appears to let the user select a &quot;From:&quot; status. For the To: field, a drop-down list appears to let users select a &quot;To:&quot; status and only a single status may be selected.</span></p>
  <p><span>In SAMPro 9.1.611.058 and above, when the user adds a new Tech line, the New Call (<a href="Registry_Entry_for_New_Call_Options.htm">sys-newcall</a>) registry keys DefaultStartDate and DefaultStartTime will be used to provide a default date and time scheduled. </span></p>
  <p style="margin-left: 8px;">The following tech Statuses have been added with their corresponding Work Escalation Status: Parts Backorder, Parts Issue and  Parts Shipped. These new statuses fall above Parts Received and below Parts Ordered in precedence.</p>
  <p style="margin-left: 8px;">A new tech Status, Wait Tracking, has been added; it has a corresponding Work Order Escalation Status of Wait Tracking (Status Category Completed), This new status falls above Completed and below Over Budget in precedence.</p>
  <p style="margin-left: 8px;">A new tech Status, Over Budget, has been added; it has a corresponding Work Order Escalation Status of Over Budget (Status Category Completed), This new status falls above Completed and below Wait Paperwork in precedence.</p>
  <p style="margin-left: 8px;">&#39;Purchases Blocked&#39; subcontractor Technicians may NOT be selected on the Tech tab. Previously, this validation was only applied to &quot;Payments Blocked&quot; technicians. See Customer Note 16.16.1 for details.</p>
  <p>This release refines the update of the Purchase Order if one Subcontractor Tech (with a referenced PO) is changed to another. The AP Term in the PO is forced to match the terms from the Vendor record, even if blank (unless overridden by customization). The PO&#39;s Sales Tax Group is updated from either the Vendor (by default) or Job record (if the DefaultPOTaxGroupFromJob is set to true in sys-viewer-vprchseordrlst registry).</p>
  <h3>16.3.13 Work Order Purchases Tab</h3>
  <p>Previously, the Work Order Purchases Tab always displayed the quantities Received and Vouchered as 0.00 (zero) if a Purchase Change Order was created after PO Receipts, even if the items had been received. In this release, the quantities Received and Vouchered are always displayed correctly.</p>
  <h3>16.3.14 <span style="font-weight: bold;">Work Order List</span></h3>
  <p>This release corrects a display problem in Work Order List views that included the Work Order Work Requested on the list. In earlier versions of 9.1 certain fields on the list would appear blank.</p>
  <p>When searching for Work Order Techs with the WorkOrdersByBranchIDByWorkOrderID&#39; list enabled, only the Primary Tech will be included in the search. The Primary Tech has been added to the list to avoid confusion.</p>
  <h3>16.3.15 Work Order Log Tab</h3>
  <p><img alt="" border="0" src="assets/images/MapIt.bmp" style="border: none;"/>This release corrects an issue where the Map It functionality) that did not work correctly if a newer version of Chrome is the default browser.  If the Latitude and Longitude fields are completed, clicking this button once again launches Google Maps with the coordinates completed.</p>
  <p>When Service Compute is run, an entry to the WO&#39;s Log Tab will be made: set the Status to Billed, the Date Logged and Work Date to today&#39;s date, and the User Id to person running the Compute.</p>
  <h3><span style="font-weight: bold;">16.3.16 Work Order Get Costs / Import Costs Wizard</span></h3>
  <p>The Work Order&#39;s Get Costs function now works differently depending on whether or not it has been quoted. The decision as to whether or not a WO has been quoted looks for Quote Scope records with a status of Accepted or Approved.  It also restricts the list to only those Scopes that are for the WO currently in the viewer.  </p>
  <p style="margin-left: 48px;"><span style="font-weight: bold;">IMPORTANT:</span> This enhancement should reduce the need to manually adjust imported revenue on quoted Work Orders. However, note that it is always important to review the billing details on a Work Order before it is invoiced.</p>
  <h5>Importing Costs if the Work Order has been Quoted</h5>
  <p style="font-weight: normal;">If the Work Ordered has been Quoted:</p>
  <p style="margin-left: 48px;">Costs will be imported at $0 Revenue to avoid double-billing.</p>
  <p style="margin-left: 48px;">The user will not be asked about importing Revenue Adjustments to avoid changing any special adjustments from the Quote.</p>
  <h5>Importing Costs if the Work Order has NOT been Quoted</h5>
  <p>The following registry may be implemented to prompt the user if they wish to import revenue adjustments when importing costs to a Work Order that is <span style="font-weight: bold;">not</span> associated with a Quote. If the user clicks Yes (to import revenue adjustments), it will have the same result as clicking the Adjust Revenue button on the Gross Margin tab.</p>
  <p style="font-weight: bold;">Registry:</p>

  <h3>16.3.17 Work Order View Reports Button</h3>
  <p><img alt="" border="0" src="assets/images/SKIN1_ViewReports.bmp" style="border: none;"/> The new View Reports button been added to the sidebar of the Work Order viewer. When enabled, it will allow users to select from a list of appropriate reports for the viewer. The following registry settings allow you to specify one or more reports to be run from the Work Order. One registry would be made for each report to be accessed from the Work Order.  </p>
  <p>If only one report is specified, it will be launched when the button is clicked with the selected Work Order Id inserted in the report&#39;s Work Order Id range.  If more than one registry has been generated, a list of reports to select from will be selected.</p>
  <p><span style="font-weight: bold;">Registry Id:</span> sys-rprt-vwrkordr:<span style="font-style: italic;">report name</span></p>
  <p>A separate Registry Id must be made for each report.  Note the colon that separates the first part of the Id field from the report name.</p>
  <p><span style="font-weight: bold;">Setting Key:</span> MenuTitle    <span style="font-weight: bold;">Setting Value:</span> <span style="font-style: italic;">report name or other text</span></p>

    The standard sys-report-<span style="font-style: italic;">functionId</span> registry should be used to set initial report values other than ranges. Initial values and bitmap registries are not supported from the sys-rprt-vwrkordr:<span style="font-style: italic;">report </span>name registry.<span style="font-style: italic;"> </span></p>
  <h3>16.3.18 <span style="font-weight: bold;">Work Order Other Info tab</span></h3>
  <p><span style="font-weight: bold;">Changed Field - Work Order Escalation Status:</span><br/>
    The Work Order Escalation Statuses of Travel, Onsite and On Break have been added to support additional granularity in Scheduled Events and reporting.   These statuses were previously grouped together as Active. When the a Work Order is escalated in this release, the Work Order Escalation Status will be set to Travel, Onsite or On Break (as applicable) if previously it would have be set to Active.  This may impact existing range settings, reports and analytics.</p>
  <h3>16.3.19 Work Order Quoted and Revenue Adjustment Lines  - CHANGE TO DEFAULT BEHAVIOR</h3>
  <p>This change addresses an issue with the Quoted Revenue lines on a Work Order and how they are feeding the Job EOM function.  In previous releases, the Effective Date on Work Order&#39;s Quoted Inventory and Other lines was the origination date of the Quote; Quoted Work Order Labor lines were set to the Quote&#39;s approval date. Since the origination date could be months in the past, this caused issues with recognizing revenue way too early through the Job EOM function.</p>
  <p>In this release, when the Work Order is set to Invoice Ready and saved, the Effective Date of Quoted lines will be updated (or not) as follows:</p>
  <p style="margin-left: 48px;">1. If the Work Order Date Work Completed is blank (set to 1900-01-01), Quoted lines will not updated.</p>
  <p style="margin-left: 48px;">2. If the Date Work Completed was set, Quoted lines will have their Effective Dates updated to the Date Work Completed.</p>
  <p style="margin-left: 48px;">3. Lines that are not Quoted will not be impacted.</p>
  <p style="margin-left: 48px;">4. The Effective Dates on the Quoted lines DON&#39;T change after the Work Order is billed if the user changes the Date Work Completed.</p>
  <p>If the Date Work Completed is set, this code will also update Revenue Adjustment lines with the Date Work Completed when the Work Order is set to Invoice Ready with the following <span style="font-weight: bold;">exceptions</span>:</p>
  <p style="margin-left: 48px;">1. If the Revenue Adjustment&#39;s Description is blank do not update the date.</p>
  <p style="margin-left: 48px;">2. If the Revenue Adjustment has been billed (the Invoice Id is set in the line), do not update the date.</p>
  <p style="margin-left: 48px;">3. If the Revenue Adjustment is a special *Accrual* line (for PreventiveMaint Work Orders) to not update the date.</p>
  <p style="margin-left: 48px;">4. Don&#39;t adjust RevAdj Effective Date unless line has a dollar value (prevents setting the date on an &#39;empty&#39; line)</p>
  <h5>Registry to Required Date Work Completed</h5>
  <p>A registry entry is available to require that the Work Order Date Work Completed is completed when the WO is marked Invoice Ready.</p>
  <p><span style="font-weight: bold;">Id:</span> sys-viewer-vwrkordr</p>
  <p><span style="font-weight: bold;">Setting Key:</span> RequireDateCompletedToInvoiceQuotes  <span style="font-weight: bold;">Setting Value:</span> true (default false)</p>
  <p><span style="font-weight: bold;">NOTE:</span> This registry should NOT be added unless the company has chosen the option 2 method of handling T&amp;M work in the Job EOM registry:</p>
  <p style="margin-left: 48px;">
    <font style="font-weight: bold;">Id:</font> sys-job-eom
  </p>
  <p style="margin-left: 48px;">
    <font style="font-weight: bold;">Setting Key:</font> T&amp;M <font style="font-weight: bold;">Setting Value:</font> Revenue

  <p style="margin-left: 48px;"> DR=WIP  CR=INCOME</p>
  <h3>16.3.20 Work Order COD Tab</h3>
  <p><span style="font-weight: bold;">Process Payment Button - New OpenEdge/Global Payments Functionality:</span> This change applies only if the new Open Edge payment processing is enabled via the global registry setting Setting Key: defaultpaymentprocessor  Setting Value: OEDBX.</p>
  <p>If the Client Site has a payment alias stored, and the user clicks the Process Payment button on the WO COD tab, they will be asked if they want to run this WO COD payment using that credit card on file. If they click yes, it will process the payment then and there and CC transaction information will write back to the WO COD line. If they click No to the question, they will be taken to the usual manual cc entry screen. The old idea behind a work order payment alias and charging a projected invoice amount (the way this used to work) has been discontinued. This change will NOT impact users running the old Open Edge functionality or EP users.</p>
  <p><span style="font-weight: bold;">CC Trx:</span> Checks applied to the Work Order COD tab from TechAnywhere no longer set the CC Trx field with the Check Number. After invoicing this resulted in Cash Receipts being ineligible for editing.</p>
  <p><span style="font-weight: bold;">Changed Field - GL Entity:</span><br/>
    Previous validation logic associated with manually entered WO-COD lines used the Job&#39;s <i style="box-sizing: border-box;">primary </i>GL Entity instead of the A/R GL Entity. In this release, the Job&#39;s A/R GL Entity is defaulted first.</p>
  <p><strong>Work Order Viewer: </strong></p>
  <p>In version 9.1.611.059 and up, users can now use a payment alias or decline to use an alias and manually provide credit card numbers. In previous versions, Work Order COD did not have a functional option to store and use a credit card from the client site.</p>
  <h3>16.3.21 UWO Tab  for Taylor Universal WOs</h3>
  <p>This update adds the option of Travel (“T”) as a Unit of Measurement to the Other Rate IDs used on the Work Order Other tab. This is a customized for Taylor Universal Work Order.</p>
  <p>This update adds a field on the Work Order UWO tab to accommodate the six (6) digit numerical value for the Factory Authorization number, when applicable.<br/>
    <strong>New Field: </strong>uwo.fctry-athrztn-nmbr
  </p>
  <p>The following validations will only be performed if the Work Order is flagged as a UWO Work Order by setting the WO Type field on the UWO tab. Note also that, consistent with other UWO validations, these validations are performed only when the Save Record is attempted.</p>
  <p style="margin-left: 48px;">The system does not allow a Work Order to be saved if the “Recall Due To” field on the UWO tab is other than “N/A”  but the “Work Order Type” field on the Main tab is other than “Call Back” (i.e. the Work Order is not a Recall).</p>
  <p style="margin-left: 48px;">The system does not allow a Work Order to be saved if the &quot;Rewrite Parts Received&quot; field on the UOW tab is other than &quot;N/A&quot; but the &quot;Original WO&quot; field on the Main tab is blank (i.e. the Work Order is not a Rewrite).</p>
  <p style="margin-left: 48px;">The system does not allow a Work Order to be flagged as both a Rewrite and a Recall.</p>
  <h2>16.4 TechFinder</h2>
  <h3>16.4.1 Multiple Certification Support</h3>
  <p>Certification tabs have been added to the Equipment (see Customer Note 2.3.2) and Site (see Customer Note 2.4.1) records. Also see Customer Note 16.1.9 for a Registry to add Work Code Certifications to TechFinder</p>
  <p>When TechFinder is launched from New Call, the Certification from the Equipment&#39;s Main Tab is listed on the Certification range (along with those from the Equipment&#39;s and Site&#39;s Certifications tabs and the Work Code). This list is prepended with an ampersand &amp; so that only those Techs with all the Certifications listed appear in TechFinder.</p>
  <p>When TechFinder is launched from the Dispatch Board or Work Order Tech tab, all Certifications from the Work Order&#39;s Site, first Equipment Id, and Work Code (if registry enabled) will be listed. This list is prepended with an ampersand &amp; so that only those Techs with all the Certifications listed appear in TechFinder.</p>
  <h3>16.4.2 New Work Order Escalation Statuses</h3>
  <p><span style="box-sizing: border-box;">By default, TechFinder looks at the escalation status of the work order as well as the individual tech statuses when determining which work orders to display.  In version 9.1.611.052, the escalation values supported (in the absence of a registry) included &#39;active&#39; but <u style="font-family: &#39;Segoe UI VSS &#39;, , &#39;Segoe UI&#39;, -apple-system, BlinkMacSystemFont, Roboto, &#39;Helvetica Neue&#39;, Helvetica, Ubuntu, Arial, sans-serif, &#39;Apple Color Emoji&#39;, &#39;Segoe UI Emoji&#39;, &#39;Segoe UI Symbol&#39;;

In Version 9.1.611.053, the new statuses of &#39;travel&#39;, &#39;onsite&#39; and &#39;on break&#39; have been added to the default work order escalation statuses supported in TechFinder.</span></p>
  <h2>16.5 Master Contract</h2>
  <p>In 9.1.611.061c and up, this update corrects a defect when registries to enable master client site equipment tables are activated, the association with what equipment is covered was broken.</p>
  <p>In 9.1.611.061 and up, this update corrects a defect where, in the Master Contract, the billings and earnings were not correctly displayed due to a missing reference. Now the billings/earnings display as they should. </p>
  <p>Previously, Master Contracts were allowed to be created for multiple sites, which produced a warning. Now when a master contract is created for duplicate sites, it produces an error and does not allow duplication.</p>
  <p>When PM&#39;s are generated for contracts with TimeofServiceBill? box flagged, the Cost Category will always be set on the WO Other tab.</p>
  <h3>16.5.1 Site List Tab</h3>
  <p><span style="font-weight: bold;">Changed Field: Cost Category</span><br/>
    This field now supports enhanced filtering provided by the Cost Code&#39;s Job Cost Category Usage Filter. Cost Categories are validated (relative to Cost Codes) during data entry upon leaving the Cost Category Id field.  The full relationship is validated again when leaving a child line or saving a record.</p>
  <h3>16.5.2  Main Tab</h3>
  <p><span style="font-weight: bold;">Changed Field: Cost Category</span><br/>
    This field now supports enhanced filtering provided by the Cost Code&#39;s Job Cost Category Usage Filter. Cost Categories are validated (relative to Cost Codes) during data entry upon leaving the Cost Category Id field.  The full relationship is validated again when leaving a child line or saving a record.</p>
  <p><span style="font-weight: bold;">New Field: Original Start Date:</span><br/>
    This informational field may be used to record the original Start Date of the Master Contract.</p>
  <h3>16.5.3 Schedule Tab</h3>
  <p style="font-weight: bold;">Changed Field: Date Scheduled - Leapday Not Allowed<br/>
    <span style="font-weight: normal;">February 29th (leapday) can cause issues with the new Master Contract Equipment functionality as well as with scheduling / billing into coming years that are not leap years. February 29th is no longer allowed to be entered as a date in the Adv. Bill or Schedule tabs, or the Master Contract saved with February 29th in the Adv. Bill or Schedule tabs; the error &quot;Invalid Month Number Entered&quot; will be displayed if this date is found. </span>
  </p>
  <p style="font-weight: normal;">By default,  you can&#39;t adjust scheduled or billed lines that have been generated but the following registry allows you to do so if absolutely necessary to change 2/29 to 2/28 so a record can be saved:</p>
  <p style="margin-left: 48px;">
    <font style="font-weight: bold;"><span style="font-weight: normal;">I</span>d:</font>
    <font style="font-weight: bold;"> </font>sys-viewer-vmstrcntrct
  </p>
  <p style="font-weight: bold; margin-left: 48px;">Setting Key:<span style="font-weight: normal;"> RemoveValidations  </span>Setting Value:<span style="font-weight: normal;"> true</span></p>
  <p><span style="font-weight: bold;">Changed Field: ScvTasksId:</span><br/>
    In previous releases, if a Service Task Id wasn&#39;t specified on the Schedule tab of PM Master Contract then no Task List was attached to the PM Work Order generated from that line.  In this release, if the Service Task Id is blank, the system now looks to see if there is one specified in the Client Site Equipment. This Service Task will be defaulted to the Client Site Equipment PM Schedule and then to the PM Work Order itself. This enhancement allows for different Task Lists to be assigned by the Equipment scheduled. If a Service Task List is specified on the Master Contract&#39;s Schedule line, it will continue to be used for all Equipment scheduled for from that line. See Customer Note 16.1.6 for a registry to disable the new behavior.</p>
  <h3>16.5.4 Time of Service Earned Enhancements</h3>
  <p>This release allows for handling of multiple sites when TimeOfService Earn? is set to Y. Additionally, when Revenue Values as %? is set to Y along with TimeOfService Earn? users may specify a percentage value in Revenue Per Visit on each Schedule line of the contract.</p>
  <p>When only TimeofService? is set to Y and multiple sites are specified - the system will evenly prorate the revenue on the corresponding RevAdjust lines that are added to the Preventive Maintenance Work Orders generated through Start Create PM Workorders.</p>
  <p>When both the TimeOfService? and Revenue Values as %? fields are set to Y with multiple sites specified - the system calculates the percentage of revenue specified in the Revenue Per Visit field based on the Site Contract Value. This percentage is reflected in the RevAdjust lines on the Preventive Maintenance Work Order generated through Start Create PM Workorders. The sum of the Revenue Per Visit on all Schedule lines must equal 100% in the Master Contract record. If the user fails to enter a percentage in the Revenue Per Visit field the system will evenly prorate the revenue.</p>
  <p>Note - the Advanced Billing will still be prorated evenly across all months set to Bill? on the Setup/Renew tab of the Master Contract.</p>
  <h3>16.5.4a Recent Update to PM Work Orders </h3>
  <p style="margin-left: 8px;"><strong>Inconsistent Behavior for Revenue Adjustment lines on PM Work Orders</strong></p>
  <p style="margin-left: 8px;">This update corrects a defect where revenue adjustment lines on PM work orders would not appear for PM Contracts because of one of the following scenarios:<br/>
    If a Site Contract value was not specified for the Time of Service Earn <br/>
    If multiple PM Contracts were processed in a batch in which one PM Contract was Time of Service Earn and its individual Schedule lines did not specify an Amount Earned value.</p>
  <p style="margin-left: 8px;"><strong>Create PM Work Orders for Master Contracts with Revenue Values as % and Scheduled Hours as %</strong></p>
  <p style="margin-left: 8px;">For Master Contracts flagged as Time of Service Earn? and Revenue Values as % the contract earnings are now correctly distributed among the preventative maintenance work orders for active equipment associated with the Master Contract and active equipment flagged as under contract when Create PM Work Orders is run.  Previously, the Revenue Values were incorrectly calculated based on ALL Equipment flagged as Under Contract, include inactive Equipment and Equipment associated with a different Master Contract.</p>
  <p style="margin-left: 8px;">This release also corrects the allocation of Hours for Master Contracts flagged as Scheduled Hours as % to active Equipment associated with the Master Contract and active Equipment flagged as under contract (but not associated with another Master Contract). </p>
  <h3>16.5.4b Recent TOS Updates</h3>
  <p style="margin-left: 8px;">In Version 9.1.611.058 and above, if all Schedule lines for the Site have $0 Revenue Per Visit, TOS Earned is checked  and the Revenue as Percent box is blank, the Site&#39;s Total Contract amount is treated as evenly distributed across the Equipment&#39;s PMSchedule Contract Values for Scheduled lines. This corrects a problem in previous releases where, if the Time Of Service Earned box was checked but the Revenue as Percent box was blank, NO revenue adjustment was written to the Work Order so that the deferred revenue was never earned.</p>
  <h3><span style="font-weight: bold;">16.5.5 Master Contract Equipment Tab</span></h3>
  <p>Users may now edit the Under Contract status of Equipment records without the list being resorted. This makes it easier to work with very large contracts.</p>
  <h3>16.5.6 Master Contract Setup / Renew Tab - Auto Populate Button</h3>
  <p>This enhancement makes the Setup/Renew functionality on the Schedule tab work similarly to the ADV Bill tab. Where possible, the system will now maintain existing values when a Schedule line corresponding to the &lt;Inspect?&gt; selection is already present instead of regenerating the whole tab from scratch.  This allows the user to update the Schedule tab on an existing Master Contract, or a cloned contract without having to manually reset individual fields.</p>
  <p style="margin-left: 48px;">The system performs the match relative to the inspection MONTH only, even if the Day is also updated.</p>
  <p style="margin-left: 88px;">For the PartType Flag setting &amp; SvcTaskId - use the current values on the Schedule tab when Setup/Renew is pressed.</p>
  <p style="margin-left: 88px;">For Hours, Work Code, EscProfile - when corresponding Parent Setup/Renew tab fields are NOT set, use the existing Schedule tab values.</p>
  <p style="margin-left: 88px;">For Work Code, EscProfile.values - when corresponding Parent Setup/Renew tab fields ARE set use them to reset lines that do not have corresponding values.  </p>
  <p style="margin-left: 88px;">Always Refresh &lt;Da&gt; value per designated Wks. Day setting on parent and Hours if set in the parent.</p>
  <h3><span style="font-weight: bold;">16.5.6a Master Contract</span> -<b>Setup/Renew Tab - Contract Total and Amount By Site </b></h3>
  <p><b>Changed Field - Contact Total:</b><br/>
    This field was previously unlabeled. This display field calculates the total amount of the contract for all Sites when Auto Populate is hit. It is maintained by the system based on how the contract is configured - Amount By Site X the number of Sites on the Site list, OR the sum of the Values fields on the Site tab.</p>
  <p><b>Changed Field: Amount By Site (was Contract Amount):</b><br/>
    This field should only be used for Single Site contracts OR if multiple Sites do NOT need differing amounts specified by Site. If there are values on the Site list the system does not allow entry into this field. When this field is completed, it is used to generate the values on the Advanced Billing tab when Auto Populate is clicked. Since this field itself is not saved, the user will be reminded to Auto Populate when saving the record if it is greater than zero but the sum of the Advanced Billed lines is zero.</p>
  <p>This field no longer attempts to calculate the average of Site List Contract Values which resulted in a &quot;Site Contract and Bill Amounts are both used&quot; error message in previous releases.</p>
  <h3>16.5.7 <span>Master Contract Equipment Table Enhancement </span></h3>
  <p>In previous releases, Site Equipment records could only be specifically associated with one Master Contract at time.  This enhancement allows Client Site equipment to be associated with multiple Master Contract records by the addition of the new Master Contract Equipment table.  In addition, this allows a Master Contract to be &#39;cloned&#39; with all of its equipment when the contract is renewed; previously it was necessary to change all of the old equipment over on the Master Contract&#39;s Equipment tab when cloning.</p>
  <p>This enhancement is available for MS SQL database installations; Sybase is not supported.</p>
  <h5>Setup and Conversion</h5>
  <p>Your support representative will need to use the revised Advanced Analytics Installer Script to create the new Master Contract Equipment table and create or update the Stored Procedure associated with it.</p>
  <p><u>A</u> global registry setting turns on the new feature but the necessary preparation with the script must be completed first by your support representative.</p>
  <p style="margin-left: 8px;"><span style="font-weight: bold;">Id:</span> sys-ffv-global-settings   (this must ONLY be set in the base registry!)</p>
  <p style="margin-left: 8px;"><span style="font-weight: bold;">Setting Key:</span> UseMasterContractEquipmentTable  <span style="font-weight: bold;">Setting Value:</span> true</p>
  <p style="margin-left: 48px;"><span style="font-weight: bold;">Master Contract Tab Registry:</span> The system will check if the registry Setting Key ChildTabs exists in sys-viewer-vmstrcntrct. If so, the user will be alerted that &#39;this must be disabled or adjusted to accommodate the new Master Contract Equipment child tab&#39;. To display the equipment child tab, if the registry sys-viewer-vmstrcntrct has the registry key “childtabs”, it needs to include ‘mcequipflp’. All available child tabs: <span style="mso-spacerun: yes;"> </span></p>
  <p style="margin-left: 88px;">sitelist,advbill, schedule,listequipment,listWOopen,listWOother,mcequipflp</p>
  <p style="margin-left: 8px;"><span>Data conversion to generate the new Master Contract Equipment (MCE) table is performed when initially activating the new feature as discussed above.  This conversion loads the MCE table with data based on each Client Site Equipment(CSE) record’s current association to a Master Contract(MC) either in the Equipment record or as part of the Client Site Equipment PM Schedule.  </span></p>
  <h5>Master Contract Viewer</h5>
  <p>When the UseMasterContractEquipmentTable global registry set to true, it effectively allows for a single Client Site Equipment (CSE) record to have simultaneous associations to multiple Master Contracts (MC).  By using this new feature, the historical perspective of all MC-CSE associations can be maintained rather than having to switch equipment from one Master Contract to another when one ends and another begins. The data conversion process populates the new MCE table based on references to MCs found in CSE records.  Additional processing also creates additional MCE rows based on references to MCs found in CSE PM Schedule lines.  </p>
  <p style="font-weight: bold; margin-left: 48px;"><u>Master Contract -  Equipment Child Tab</u></p>
  <p style="margin-left: 48px;">When the UseMasterContractEquipmentTable global registry set to true, the previous version of this tab is replaced by a newer, more functional list-type tab.  It still serves the basic purpose of identifying covered CSE records. When a Master Contract record is loaded into the viewer, this tab will be populated with every <b>active</b> CSE record from every Client Site (CS) listed on the Site List tab.  The user will never have the option of manually entering CSE Ids.</p>
  <p style="margin-left: 88px;"><span style="font-weight: bold;">Covered:</span><br/>
    If this column is set to &#39;Yes&#39; the Equipment is covered by this Master Contract. This tab uses the right-mouse click as the toggle switch for identifying Covered vs non-Covered CSE records as in previous releases.  Double-clicking a line will open the selected CSE record.</p>
  <p style="font-weight: bold; margin-left: 88px;">Site Id:  Site Name: Equipment Id:  Equipment Name:  Mfg: Model: Serial No: Type: MCErn: SCEru:</p>
  <p style="margin-left: 88px;">This tab also includes CheckAll and ClearAll buttons.  <span style="font-weight: bold;">It should be noted that CheckAll and ClearAll are sensitive to any filtering that has been applied to the list.  Only the filtered rows are affected by the check buttons.</span>  For example, filtering to a single Site and pushing CheckAll makes all CSE from that Site Covered.</p>
  <p style="margin-left: 48px; font-weight: bold;"><u>Master Contract Site List Child Tab</u></p>
  <p style="margin-left: 48px;">Validation now prevents adding the same Site multiple times. The Line Insert w/Copy action clears the Site Id to prevent accidental duplication of Site Ids. Adding a new Site Id adds all active CSE records for the Site to the new Equipment tab.  Each added CSE record defaults to not Covered.</p>
  <p style="margin-left: 48px;">Removing or changing a Site now has validation that prevents its removal if the Site or any of its CSE records have <b><i>posted</i></b> references to the MC.  These references might exist on either the CS-PMBilling or the CSE-PMSchedule child tabs.  When <b><i>posted</i></b> MC references exist, the Site cannot be removed but the individual CSE records can still be set to NOT Covered on the new MSE child.  See below for definitions of <b><i>posted</i></b>. Note: similar validation and messaging occurs if an attempt is made to delete a child row that violates the above.</p>
  <p style="margin-left: 88px;"><u>Posted Client Site - PMBilling Tab</u></p>
  <p style="margin-left: 88px;">References to the Master Contract found on the Client Site - PMBilling tab are considered posted when either the PM Invoice Id contains an Invoice Id or the Posted to GL flag is True.  </p>
  <p style="margin-left: 88px;"><u>Posted Client Site Equipment - PMSchedule</u></p>
  <p style="margin-left: 88px;">References to the Master Contract found on the Client Site Equipment - PMSchedule are considered posted when the PM WO Id field contains a Work Order Id.  </p>
  <p style="font-weight: bold; margin-left: 48px;"><u>Master Contract Schedule Child Tab</u></p>
  <p style="margin-left: 48px;">hen the UseMasterContractEquipmentTable global registry is set to true, entry in the line’s Cost Per Visit field is not allowed.  The message &quot;This database is configured to use the Master Contract Equipment table.

  <p style="margin-left: 88px;"><img alt="" border="0" src="assets/images/BuildOutPMWOs.bmp" style="border: none;"/> The MC viewer’s Main form now includes the Build Out PM WOs button. It will be available to all installs using the Master Contract Equipment table in a future release. The Build Out button may be disabled via registry if needed.</p>
  <h5>Additional Changes to Support the Master Contract Equipment Table</h5>
  <p style="margin-left: 8px;"><span>The following changes will be made to several viewers to support this enhancement. </span></p>
  <h5>Client Site Viewer Changes</h5>
  <p style="margin-left: 48px; mso-fareast-font-family: &#39;Times New Roman&#39;;

	 font-weight: bold;">Status:</p>
  <p style="margin-left: 48px; mso-fareast-font-family: &#39;Times New Roman&#39;;">The Status column indicates the status of the Master Contract (if any) associated with the Equipment. If multiple contracts exist for a piece of equipment, multiple equipment lines may be displayed.</p>

  <h5>Start Create New Billing Schedule from Old</h5>
  <h5>Start Create New PM Work Schedule from Old</h5>
  <h5>Start Renew Service Contracts</h5>
  <p style="margin-left: 8px;"><span><u style="text-decoration: none; ">W</u>i</span><span>th the UseMasterContractEquipmentTable global registry set to true, each of the above starter functions has been changed so that lines from the <i>Old</i> schedule are ignored when they have references to Master Contracts. In the case of Start Create New PM Work Schedule From Old, lines will NOT be copied if the Client Site Equipment </span><span style="text-decoration: underline; ">parent</span><span> record references a Master Contract even if the lines in the old schedule do not. Lines referencing MCs will get replicated in other ways.</span></p>

  <p style="margin-left: 48px;">By default, the &#39;Do&#39; box may NOT be cleared for Master Contract lines to assure that associated costs and revenues are in sync with Master Contract values. It may still be cleared for non Master Contract lines. The Clear All button only clears non-Master Contract lines. The Check All button checks all lines. A registry may be enabled to allow lines associated with the Master Contract to be disabled. This change is true whether or not the UseMasterContractEquipmentTable global registry is set to true. This change was made to prevent issues with Time of Service Earned and Billed Master Contracts being improperly billed / earned.  See Customer Note 16.1.4d for a registry to allow lines to be deselected.<span style="font-weight: bold;"> </span></p>
  <h5>Create PM Billings</h5>
  <p style="margin-left: 8px;"><span>When the UseMasterContractEquipmentTable global registry set to true, this process uses the new database Function to interpret Master Contract definitions.</span></p>
  <h3>16.5.8 Adv. Billing Tab</h3>
  <p><span style="font-weight: bold;">Changed Field: Date Scheduled - Leapday Not Allowed</span><br/>
    February 29th (leapday) can cause issues with the new Master Contract Equipment functionality as well as with scheduling / billing into coming years that are not leap years. February 29th is no longer allowed to be entered as a date in the Adv. Bill or Schedule tabs, or the Master Contract saved with February 29th in the Adv. Bill or Schedule tabs; the error &quot;Invalid Month Number Entered&quot; will be displayed if this date is found.</p>
  <p style="font-weight: normal;">By default,  you can&#39;t adjust scheduled or billed lines that have been generated but the following registry allows you to do so if absolutely necessary to change 2/29 to 2/28 so a record can be saved:</p>
  <p style="margin-left: 48px;">

  <h3>16.5.9 CVS Import of Master Contract Sites</h3>
  <p><img alt="" border="0" src="assets/images/image/SKIN1_CSV.gif" style="border: none;"/> A new CSV button has been added to the side toolbar of the Sites child tab of the Master Contract Viewer.  It allows the user to add lines from a .cvs file to a brand new Master Contract record.</p>
  <p>When the .CSV button is pressed it verifies that the viewer is a New Record and that no changes have been made to the record before presenting a file selection dialog to access a provided CSV.  </p>
  <p>The .cvs file must include a header row specifying the following columns that will define the lines that will be added to the Master Contract&#39;s Sites column:</p>
  <p style="margin-left: 48px;">Site Id<br/>
    Job Id<br/>
    Job Cost Code Id<br/>
    Billing Item Id<br/>
    Cost Category Id<br/>
    Contract Values<br/>
    Contract Hours</p>
  <p style="margin-left: 8px;">All of the Id lines must specify valid record Id&#39;s. the Values and Hours columns must be numeric.</p>
  <p style="margin-left: 8px;">If any value for a new line is considered invalid, that line is skipped and after all lines have been processed the user will be presented with a text box containing a list of the errors and the error.log file will also contain the errors.</p>
  <p style="margin-left: 8px;"><span style="font-weight: normal;">Once the Site lines have been added, complete the Master Contract and be sure to save it. </span></p>
  <h2>16.6 Escalation Profile</h2>
  <h3>16.6.1 Child Tab</h3>
  <p><img alt="" border="0" src="assets/images/image/Magnify.gif" style="border: none;"/> Click Magnify</p>
  <p><span style="font-weight: bold;">New Field: Disabled</span><br/>
    When this field is flagged, this event will be ignored when scheduled events are generated for a new Weblog or Work Order. Weblogs and Work Orders created before line was flagged as disabled will not be impacted; the Scheduled Event will still be processed.</p>
  <h3>16.6.2 Tokens</h3>
  <p>This release supports tokens for the Latitude and Longitude fields in the Client Site. The token ^clntste.geo_code_latitude^ references Latitude and ^clntste.geo_code_longitude^ references Longitude.</p>
  <p>The new ^workperformedall^ token displays the Equipment Id, Name and Work Performed of all Equipment lines on the Work Order when the Scheduled Event is executed.</p>
  <p>The new IVR Instructions field on the Client Site record may be used in escalation emails (using the token ^clntste_ivr^) to the Technician. It is also designed for future use in TechAnywhere.</p>
  <h3>16.6.3 Emailing Documents Attached After Work Order Creation</h3>
  <p>Previously, to attach SAMPro documents to an escalation profile email, you had to select the documents by category at the time of New Call creation. This would add those documents to the work order at that time, and only those documents could be attached to the notification email. In this release, you can specify which categories of documents will be attached on each individual line of the escalation profile. This allows for documents added after initial creation to be attached to the corresponding email as the work order&#39;s technician status changes.</p>
  <p>To attach documents to escalation notifications based on pre-determined document categories listed in Function Parameters field of Escalation Profile:</p>
  <p>The document(s) must be attached to the work order prior to the specified status change to be eligible for attachment.</p>
  <p>The Attach Document flag must be checked on child line of escalation profile. Hit the green plus sign on the top left corner of the escalation profile line to show the Function Parameters field. Set the document categories you wish to attach to the notification that is triggered by that lines status change. “Categories=” will precede a comma delimited list of valid document categories.</p>
  <p style="margin-left: 48px;">Tip: Double click the Category field in any document viewer in SAMPro to view a list of valid Document Categories. Custom Document Categories may be added manually and will be included if specified. <span style="mso-spacerun: yes;"> </span>***NOTE – SAMPro generated invoices are given a category of “Invoice” (not “Invoices”) and MUST be specified as such in the escalation profile for inclusion.</p>
  <p style="margin-left: 48px;">Important: The document must be a filetype capable of opening via email. We recommend autosavefiletype = PDF<span style="mso-spacerun: yes;"> </span> be set in all report registries for the documents you wish to attach via escalation profile. Reports that autosave as a .dbr can only be opened in SAMPro and therefore will not open via email. Any/all pre-existing document records should be converted from .dbr to PDF before utilizing this functionality.</p>
  <p style="margin-left: 8px; text-decoration: underline; ">Example:</p>

  <p>Function Parameters: Categories=Quote,VendorInvoice</p>
  <p>In the example above, any document with a category of Quote or VendorInvoice that is attached to the work order prior to that status change will be attached to the email and sent to the contact specified in the Notify Id.</p>
  <h3><span style="font-weight: bold;">16.6 4  Account Manager Notifications</span></h3>
  <p>When a Notification Category is set to Account Manager, the Work Order&#39;s Account Manager&#39;s Contact Record Email Address is used to derive the &#39;email to&#39; of the scheduled event.  Previously, the Site&#39;s Account Manager was always used, regardless of whether is was set in the Equipment record or changed in New Call. Note that if the Account Manager is cleared in New Call the selected Site&#39;s Account Manager Contact will continue to be used for Account Manager Notifications and Alarms.</p>
  <h3>16.6.5 New Escalation Profile Action Types</h3>
  <p style="margin-left: 8px;">2 new escalation profile Action Types have been added:</p>
  <p style="margin-left: 48px;">AlarmR - recurring alarm<br style="color: #000000; 
															 font-family: Verdana, &#39;Helvetica Neue&#39;, Helvetica, Arial, sans-serif; 
															 font-size: 14px; 
															 font-style: normal; 
															 font-variant-ligatures: normal; 
															 font-variant-caps: normal; 
															 font-weight: 400; 
															 letter-spacing: normal; 
															 orphans: 2; 
															 text-align: start; 
															 text-indent: 0px; 
															 text-transform: none; 
															 white-space: normal; 
															 widows: 2; 
															 word-spacing: 0px; 
															 -webkit-text-stroke-width: 0px; 
															 text-decoration-style: initial; 
															 text-decoration-color: initial;"/>
    NotificationR - recurring notification</p>
  <p style="margin-left: 8px;">When a recurring alarm or notification is executed, the scheduled event will be sent back to OnHold so that it can be run again. These events would typically be used to ensure that service or account managers were alerted if a work order repeatedly achieved a certain status.</p>
  <p style="margin-left: 48px;">The recurring-type events can ONLY be used for events identified as Contingent; this has been added as validation in the Escalation Profile viewer.</p>
  <p style="margin-left: 48px;">The recurring alarms and notifications cannot be used for Tech-based notifications (also enforced by validation). .</p>
  <p style="margin-left: 8px;">For example, a business case for this new feature could be to build a Recurring Notification that triggers when the escalation status changes from Active to WaitcustApprvl. If it triggers and executes, the system would reset the Escalation Event to OnHold so that if the work order ever gets set to WaitCustApprvl again it would execute again (and subsequently go back on hold).<span style="font-weight: bold;"> </span></p>
  <h3>16.6.6 New Work Order Escalation Statuses</h3>
  <p>This enhancement allows users to specify more granularity for escalation statuses.  In this release, the Escalation Manager supports three new Work Order Escalation statuses: Travel, OnSite, and OnBreak. Previously, these were lumped together as &#39;active&#39;. The Escalation Manager has been updated so that when the technician status changes to Travel it triggers escalation events based on both Travel and Active, and likewise for the other two statuses. This allows existing Scheduled Events to be handled as usual, as well as for Escalation Profiles to be revised/created to support the new statuses.</p>
  <p style="font-weight: bold;">Work Order Other Info tab</p>
  <p>The Work Order Escalation Statuses of Travel, Onsite and On Break have been added to support additional granularity in Scheduled Events and reporting.   These statuses were previously grouped together as Active. When the a Work Order is escalated in this release, the Work Order Escalation Status will be set to Travel, Onsite or On Break (as applicable) if previously it would have be set to Active.  This may impact existing range settings, reports and analytics.</p>
  <p style="font-weight: bold;">Escalation Profile Status List</p>
  <p>The Work Order Escalation Statuses of Travel, Onsite and On Break have been added the Status list.  These statuses were previously grouped together as Active. Existing Escalation Profiles referencing the Active status will continue to be supported. New or existing profiles may specify onsite, travel, on break or active as statuses.</p>
  <p style="font-weight: bold;">Escalation Hierarchy</p>
  <p>The escalation hierarchy has been updated as shown in the table below; the new functionality is highlighted.</p>

  <h2>16.7 Work Order Entry</h2>
  <p>Now supports posting to expanded Work Order Labor and Inventory cost and price fields. Also supports Accounting Periods with WO Inventory to GL flagged.</p>
  <h2><span style="font-weight: bold;">16.8 Start Scheduled Event Purge</span></h2>
  <p style="margin-left: 8px;">Now purges scheduled events for archived WO&#39;s.  </p>
  <h2>16.9 Start Archive Work Orders</h2>
  <p style="margin-left: 8px;">If the WO&#39;s Date Work Completed is set, it is now used for the archived Tech line. If the Date Work Completed is not set, the archived Tech line has today&#39;s date, as before.</p>
  <p style="margin-left: 8px;"><span style="font-weight: bold;">New Field: Date Completed:</span><br/>
    This field allows the user to include only those Work Orders whose Date Work Completed falls on or before the selected date (subject to the Date Opened Date Closed settings). If this field is completed, Work Orders whose Date Work Completed is blank will also be excluded. If this field blank, the Work Order&#39;s Date Work Completed will not be considered by this function when generating the checklist.</p>
  <h2>16.10 New Call</h2>
  <p>The Equipment&#39;s Date Installed has been added to the right-hand side of the Equipment pane.</p>
  <p style="font-weight: bold; margin-left: 8px;"><span style="font-weight: normal;">This release corrects an issue when the Market Source was not always written to the Work Order. It also corrects a sporadic problem where the WO Email was not defaulted from the Client Site.</span></p>
  <p>The Work Requested verbiage from the selected Web Log is used to generate the new Work Order&#39;s Work Requested and Equipment Work Requested, correcting a sporadic problem in previous releases.</p>
  <p style="margin-left: 8px;">&#39;Purchases Blocked&#39; subcontractor Technicians may NOT be selected in New Call but &quot;Payments Blocked&quot; technicians may be selected. See Customer Note 16.16.1 for details.</p>
  <p>The PO Required field is once again enforced; corrects a problem in recent versions.  </p>
  <p style="margin-left: 8px;">The Site&#39;s Service Manager is no longer cleared when changing the Job changes the Client. Corrects a problem when the sys-newcall option ServiceManagerBasedOnSite=true.</p>
  <p style="margin-left: 8px;">In this release, Ctrl-A is ignored instead of generating an error.  The Add WO button must be clicked to add the Work Order; the keyboard equivalent is not supported.</p>
  <p style="margin-left: 8px;">This release corrects a performance slowdown loading New Call in recent versions.</p>
  <p style="margin-left: 8px;">This release refines handling of the middle pane so that the Client Site List (and not the Master Contract pane) is displayed after the user completes a Call Script.</p>
  <p style="margin-left: 8px;"><span style="font-weight: bold;">Master Contract Id: </span><span style="font-style: italic;">(requires special v.cus file to display this field)</span><br/>
    If the selected Equipment is associated with a Master Contract that is currently open or will be open in the future, the Master Contract Id is added to the Work Order header to support custom reporting/analysis of full service contracts.</p>
  <p style="margin-left: 8px;">When the Web Log references more than one work order, the dispatch comments are left blank. Before, the new web log would provide dispatcher comments from the first work order referenced in the web log.</p>
  <h3>16.10.1 Weblogs from TechAnywhere</h3>
  <p>Previously when filtering the equipment, the requested equipment was being filtered out of the list due to the user’s service category filtering when it should not have been. This issue was due to a timing error noticeable in a specific customization. Now, the service category filtering occurs after the equipment has loaded. This update will be included for all customers.</p>
  <p>This update provides a minor performance update to TechAnywhere message processing for web logs.</p>
  <p><span style="font-weight: bold;">Changed Field: Weblog</span><br/>
    When a Weblog from TechAnywhere is entered in New Call, a wizard displaying the Weblog information will appear. The following buttons allow you to process the Weblog as follows:</p>
  <p><span style="font-weight: bold;">Proceed:</span>  Clicking this button will use this Weblog to create a new Work Order. The contents will load into NewCall to allow the dispatcher to finish creating the new Work Order.</p>
  <p><span style="font-weight: bold;">Decline:</span>  Gives the user the opportunity to change a Weblog to the status of ‘Cancelled’ to remove it from the list of New/Unacknowledged Weblogs.</p>
  <p><span style="font-weight: bold;">AssignToWO:</span> Click this button to select an existing Work Order to assign this Weblog to. The Weblog’s Equipment and Work Requested contents will be added to the Work Order&#39;s Equipment Tab. The Weblog will also be changed to Acknowledged and reference the selected Work Order.</p>
  <p><span style="font-weight: bold;">Cancel:</span> Returns you to the New Call with the weblog field cleared. It only cancels the operation of selecting the Weblog; it does NOT set the Weblog&#39;s status to Cancelled. Note: Pressing the X works the same as the Cancel button.</p>
  <h3>16.10.2  Caller Specific Email for Escalation rules</h3>
  <p><span style="font-weight: bold;">New Field: Work Order Email</span><br/>
    When a Site is selected in New Call, the Client Site&#39;s Email field is now defaulted to new Work Order Email field. The user may manually update this field if desired. Escalations for the new  Notification Source &#39;Work Order&#39; will be sent to this address.</p>
  <p>The Email address for the Scheduled Events is set when the WO is generated. Changing it in the Work Order after creation will not propagate the change to the Events themselves.</p>
  <p>The Work Order Email is also set from the Site Email by the following functions:</p>
  <p style="margin-left: 48px;">Start Create PM Work Orders<br/>
    Start Create Job Scheduler WOs<br/>
    TechAnywhere - new WOs created from TechAnywhere<br/>
    QuoteMaster/Quote Manager (new Work Orders generated by this function).</p>
  <h5>Notification Category</h5>
  <p><span style="font-weight: bold;">New Source: Work Order</span><br/>
    If the Source &#39;Work Order&#39; is selected, the Work Order&#39;s Email Address field will be used when generating Email Notifications/Alarms.</p>
  <h5>Escalation Profile</h5>
  <p><span style="font-weight: bold;">Notification Category:</span><br/>
    Escalation Profiles for Work Orders now support Notification Categories with a Source of Work Order.</p>
  <h3><span style="font-weight: bold;">16.10.3  New Call (FMMS)</span></h3>
  <p style="margin-left: 8px;">Previously in New Call, when creating a Work Order from an FMMS Web Log, the selection window appeared with no relevant Tracking Number from Service Channel. Now the selection window includes the tracking ID and is placed to the right of the &quot;ServiceChannel&quot;.</p>
  <p style="margin-left: 8px;">The NTE amount from the selected Service Request now defaults to the NTE Client field which will populate the corresponding field in the newly created Work Order.</p>
  <p style="margin-left: 8px;">Also fixes an error accessing the FMMSInfo table when the Vendor Value includes an apostrophe (e.g. &quot;Domino&#39;s&quot;).</p>
  <p style="margin-left: 8px;">This release corrects issues in the FacilitySource integration when selecting the web log.</p>
  <h3>16.10.4  New Call 2</h3>
  <p>In version 9.1.611.060 and up, this update provides reminders for past due payments for invoices made via the NewCall COD Job&#39;s setup. When users create a work order via the Create New COD Sites feature in New Call, the Past Due warning messages appear if their client didn’t pay upon delivery. </p>
  <p>This release corrects an issue where changing the selected Site Equipment updated all applicable fields except the field the cursor was positioned on.  In this release selecting the Site Equipment also updates the New Call 2 field the cursor is positioned on.   </p>
  <p><span style="font-weight: bold;">New Field: Original Caller</span><br/>
    This field lists the person who called in this Work Order. It defaults from the Contact 1 First and Last Name fields in the Client Site record (if completed); if these fields are not completed it will default from the Client Site Contact 2 information. This field may be changed by the user; it will be written to the Work Order&#39;s Original Caller field.</p>
  <h3>16.10.5 New Call Create New COD</h3>
  <p><span style="font-weight: bold;">New Field: Original Caller</span><br/>
    This field lists the person who called in this Work Order. If completed by the user, it will be written to the Work Order&#39;s Original Caller field.</p>
  <p>The Quote Report Id (QuoteDefaults tab) and the GL Entity Id (COP tab) are now defaulted from the Client Site template to the new Client Site created by this function.</p>
  <h3>16.10.5 Service Manager Defaulting</h3>
  <p>In this release, the Client has been added to the New Call Service Manager defaulting. The hierarchy is as follows: Client Site Equipment - Client Site - Client - User. The Service Manager selected when the Work Order is added will be written to the new Work Order.</p>
  <h3>16.10.6  New Call Work Order List</h3>
  <p>Archived Work Orders (with a Work Order Status Category of Archived) are now excluded from the New Call WO list in SAMPro. This was done to improve the performance of New Call, especially when displaying Sites with significant history.  </p>
  <p style="margin-left: 48px;"><span style="font-weight: bold;">Reminder on Archiving:</span><br/>
    As in previous release, the Start Archive Work or Start Autoarchive Work Order functions may be used to Archive Work Orders. A Work Order may also be set to a Work Order Status Category of Archived by adding a Technician Line with a status of Archived; when the Work Order is saved the Status Category will be reset to Archived. A Work Order is &#39;unarchived&#39; by deleting the Tech line set to Archived and saving the Work Order.</p>
  <h2>16.11 Dispatch Board (SAMPro)</h2>
  <p><img alt="" border="2" src="assets/images/verizonbutton.jpg" style="border: Solid 2px #808080;"/> What begin it&#39;s corporate life as &#39;Sagequest&#39; turned into Fleetmatics and is now Verizon Connect.  The button has been changed to reflect this, as have the mouse over and status pane references.</p>
  <p>This release corrects an extremely sporadic problem where closing the Dispatch Board after setting a Custom Date on the Date Range tab resulted in a childless copy of the selected Work Order being generated.</p>
  <p style="margin-left: 8px;"><span style="font-weight: bold;">Error Handling: c</span>orrects a &#39;doWIthIndex:&#39; error related to list pane filtering, and a very sporadic &#39;key is missing error&#39; on certain mouse movements. Also corrects a sporadic &quot;System Primitive Failed&quot; error when clicking on the column header of the Time Chart.</p>
  <p style="margin-left: 8px;"><span style="font-weight: bold;">Column Filters:</span> If you use the new column filtering on the Workorder List, these filters are cleared on the Workorder List pane when a new Technician is selected on the Tech Status Summary (upper) pane.</p>
  <p><img alt="" border="0" src="assets/images/image/SKIN1_SendEmail.gif" style="border: none;"/> When UseOutlook is enabled via registry, clicking the Email button launches the Outlook form and sets the Email To field with the Tech’s Email Address 2.</p>
  <p>&#39;Purchases Blocked&#39; subcontractor Techs may NOT be selected if their required insurance is expired on the selected date.  </p>
  <p>When a Subcontractor Tech is changed on the WO Tech tab or the Dispatch Board, the system automatically changes the Vendor in the associated PO. In this release, the PO&#39;s A/P Terms and Sales Tax Group are also updated from the Vendor record.</p>
  <p><img alt="" border="0" src="assets/images/image/SKIN1_techlist-.gif" style="border: none;"/> When the Tech Lists button is clicked, the Dispatch Board Id and Name will both appear when the list of Dispatch Boards is displayed.  This release also corrects a System Primitive Error in the Tech Lists tab when the user clicked at the top of the tab so that no list was selected, and displays Tech Lists with 15 character Id&#39;s correctly.</p>
  <p>Work Order changes are only allowed from the Dispatch Board if the User belongs to a Group with Change permission for View Work Order or Work Order Dispatcher. <span style="font-weight: bold;"> </span></p>
  <h3>16.11.1 Classic Board</h3>
  <p style="font-weight: normal;">Corrects an &#39;argument must be a collection&#39; error launching TechFinder.</p>
  <p style="margin-left: 8px;"><img alt="" border="0" src="assets/images/image/SKIN1_Dates-.gif" style="border: none;"/> The Date Range button has been added to the Classic and Day boards. This allows users to switch the Date Range without having to switch to the Powerboard first.</p>
  <p style="margin-left: 8px;">This release corrects an overlap issue that made it difficult to click the left arrow to change the Date Scheduled. <span style="font-weight: bold;"> </span></p>
  <h3><span style="font-weight: bold;">16.11.2 Work Order Summary</span></h3>
  <p><span style="font-weight: bold;">T</span>he Work Order Summary screen is accessed from the Power Board by right-clicking on a Work Order and selecting Update Work Order. It allows the dispatcher limited edits to specific WO fields. This function was never designed to support the deletion Work Order lines. The Delete Line button has been removed from the side button bar in this release to avoid confusion. This release also corrects a &#39;key is missing error&#39; when Equipment is added or changed on the Equipment tab.</p>
  <h3>16.11.3 Power Board</h3>
  <p>The Work Order&#39;s Earliest Start date has been added to the Power Board as a new column. This column will initially be located on the extreme right-hand side of the work order list, but drag and drop may be used to reposition it according the user&#39;s preference.</p>
  <h3>16.11.4 Dispatch Board Filter Tab</h3>
  <p>The following statuses have been added to the &#39;uncompleted&#39; filter option:  parts pickup, parts backorder, parts issue, parts shipped.</p>
  <p>A status can be added to the Tech Status range by left-clicking on the Filter-By-Status Options list. Duplicated status are now removed from the Tech Status range when it is updated via left-click to prevent range issues.</p>
  <p>The SAMPro Dispatch Board &quot;uncompleted&quot; filter now includes &quot;Manager Review,&quot; which is listed as a filtered tech status.</p>
  <h2>16.12 Verizon Connect (was Fleetmatics)</h2>
  <p>Version 9.1.611.056b disables all logging to the &#39;SQHelper.log&#39; file.  This change was made because in some cases where users and services are getting a &#39;Runtime Error: FileSharingViolation&#39; error which has to do with the SQHelper.log file that is generated from the SageQuest/Fleetmatics/Verizon integration. This logging was not being used by support for troubleshooting and is now disabled since it was causing problems.</p>
  <p style="font-weight: bold; margin-left: 8px;"><span style="font-weight: normal;">This release corrects a formatting issue which prevented GPS stops from getting to Verizon Connect (Fleetmatics).</span></p>
  <p style="margin-left: 8px;">This release provides revised handling of the cancellation of a schedule date, and direction request to be compatible with the Fleetmatics work order format.</p>
  <h2>16.13 Create PM Work Orders</h2>
  <p>Previously, when creating a PM Work Order via Start Create PM Work Orders, a work order would only be created at the Waiting parts status if all equipment records had a service parts list. However, work orders should be created at this status if any equipment has a Service Parts list and should be created at Waiting Parts. This update corrects this defect.</p>
  <p>Client Site WO Other lines are now applied to <span style="font-weight: bold;">all</span> applicable PM Work Orders when enabled via registry (see Customer Note 16.1.4b) in Version 9.1.611.056.  </p>
  <p>This release corrects a problem where the Tech Status was not always set correctly if Required Resource lines were generated for some Equipment (via the Service Parts list) but not others on the same Preventative Maintenance WO.</p>
  <p style="margin-left: 8px;">This release corrects a problem where only the first line marked &quot;Already Done&quot; was handled correctly. In this release, all PM&#39;s checked as &quot;Already Done&quot; will have the Equipment PM Schedule line updated with &quot;NO WO&quot; as the WO ID.</p>
  <p style="margin-left: 8px;">When the TechServiceParts=No registry is enabled and Service Parts and Tasks are specified, the Tasks now correctly written to the WO Equipment Work Requested</p>
  <p style="margin-left: 8px;">When this function generates a PO for Subcontractor Techs, the Site Equipment being serviced is completed on the PO&#39;s Gen line.</p>
  <p style="margin-left: 8px;">In 9.1.611.059, an issue is corrected where the Service Task list was not written to Work Order Equipment Work Requested if the Work Order Parts list did not reference any of Parts Types flagged in the Site Equipment PMSchedule. The Service Tasks will now be correctly written to the Work Order Equipment Work Requested (when enabled via registry) if no Service Parts are eligible.</p>
  <h3>16.13.1 New field - Override ALL Techs?</h3>
  <p>If this box is checked and the Technician Id field is also completed, the Technician Id selected will be assigned to ALL work orders generated by this function.  If the Override ALL Tech? box is blank, the Technician Id (if selected) will only be used where a Technician is not specified in the Equipment or Site record. If the Override ALL Techs? box is checked the Technician Id must be completed.  Additional changes to the Technician may be made when the Create PM WOs checklist screen is displayed.</p>
  <h2>16.14 Notification Category</h2>
  <p><span style="font-weight: bold;">Changed Field - Method:</span><br/>
    <font face="Tahoma" style="font-family: Tahoma;">The obsolete TechAnywhere option has been removed from the list of Methods to avoid confusion. This option was for RTD (Remote Tech Device for the Blackberry) notifications in previous releases.</font>
  </p>
  <p style="margin-left: 48px; font-family: Tahoma;"><span style="font-weight: bold;">NOTE:</span> If any Notification Category records specifying the Method &#39;TechAnywhere&#39; exist in your data, the &#39;Selected Record Not Found&#39; message will appear when selecting from a list. The Notification record&#39;s Id must be typed in to access / edit the record.  You may wish to Obsolete these entries.</p>
  <p style="font-family: Tahoma; margin-left: 8px;"><span style="font-weight: bold;">New Source: Work Order</span><br/>
    If the Source &#39;Work Order&#39; is selected, the Work Order&#39;s Email Address field will be used when generating Email Notifications/Alarms.</p>
  <h2><span style="font-weight: bold;">16.15 Start Renew Service Contracts</span> </h2>
  <p style="margin-left: 8px;">Previously, running the Renew Service Contracts function renewed PM Schedule lines on equipment for inactive sites. This is unnecessary as the sites are inactive and don&#39;t need to be renewed. Now inactive sites remain inactive when running the Renew Service Contracts function.</p>
  <p style="margin-left: 8px;">When a Time of Service Earned contract is updated, the Advanced Bill lines are now updated by the percentage specified. In recent releases, only the Scheduled (accrual) lines were updated.  </p>
  <p style="margin-left: 8px;">Corrects a problem where TOS Equipment values and Client Site Billing amounts were being combined.</p>
  <p style="margin-left: 8px;">In previous releases, Start Renew Service Contract renewed schedules on inactive pieces of equipment if they are marked OK to renew.  In this release, Active/Inactive status of the equipment be considered during the renewal process so that Equipment flagged as Inactive will be skipped.</p>
  <h3><b style="mso-bidi-font-weight: normal;">16.15.1 Start Renew Service Contract Checklist</b></h3>
  <p style="margin-left: 8px;">This release corrects the issue where manual changes to the New Value field in the Start Renew Service Contracts Checklist were being ignored. The PM Billing lines on the Client Site were generated in the amount of the original contract, rather that the New Value entered during the renewal function. PM Billing lines are now given the cumulative total of the manually entered New Value.</p>
  <p>The Description column has been enhanced to better define that type of renewal being run based on the types of lines filled in on the Site PM Billing and/or the Site Equipment PM Schedule:</p>
  <p style="margin-left: 48px;">PM Billing has no value and PM Schedule has no contract value: T&amp;M Inspections</p>
  <p style="margin-left: 48px;">Scheduled PM Billing has no value and PM Schedule has contract value: Equipment: Time of Service Billing</p>
  <p style="margin-left: 48px;">PM Billing has value: Site: Bill in Advance</p>
  <h2>16.16  Technician Viewer</h2>
  <h3>16.16.1 Main Tab</h3>

  </p>
  <p style="font-weight: bold;">New Fields:</p>
  <p><span style="font-weight: bold;">Vendor Name:</span><br/>
    If the Vendor field is completed on this subcontractor technician record, the Vendor&#39;s Name will be displayed, and the following fields will be completed if applicable.</p>
  <p>
    <font style="font-weight: bold;">Insurance Required: Insurance Expired:</font><br/>
    The insurance required field defaults from the Insurance Required field in the Vendor record. If this field is checked, the system will check the INS tab in the Vendor record to determine if all insurance is still valid. If not, the Insurance Expired field will also be checked.
  </p>
  <p><span style="font-weight: bold;">Payments Blocked:</span><br/>
    If this display field is checked, the Vendor’s Insurance is flagged as &#39;Block Payments&#39; and it is currently expired. A &#39;Payments Blocked&#39; subcontractor may now be selected in New Call, the Dispatch Board or on a Work Order in SAMPro 9.1.611.045 and above. This was not true in previous releases.</p>
  <p>
    <font style="font-weight: bold;">Purchases</font>
    <font style="font-weight: bold;">Blocked:</font><br/>
    If this display field is checked, the Vendor’s Insurance is flagged as &#39;Block Purchases&#39; and it is currently expired. A &#39;Purchases Blocked Tech&#39; may NOT be selected in New Call, on the Dispatch Board and on Work Orders.

  <p style="font-weight: bold;">New Remote Device Type - DBFleet</p>
  <p>The DBFleet option supports a new mode built into the TechAnywhere app that only allows the user to use the DBFleet portion for GPS tracking and reporting to DBFleet. It disables all other TechAnywhere functionality. This allows a company that does not use TechAnywhere or has employees who would not need to use TechAnywhere, to have the ability to track these employees through DBFleet.</p>
  <p style="margin-left: 48px;"><span style="font-weight: bold;">Important Implementation Note:</span> If a client does not have/use TechAnywhere and wants to do this for DBFleet, a full TechAnywhere install will need to take place first.</p>
  <p>Licensing for this mode is handled in DBFleet - SAMPro does not track count.</p>
  <p>In order to log into TechAnywhere in this mode, the Technician record will need to be configured as follows:</p>
  <p style="margin-left: 48px;">Web Access = Technician<br/>
    Remote Device Type = DBFleet<br/>
    Set and confirm a password</p>
  <h2>16.17 Project Work Order Generator</h2>
  <h3>16.17.1 Project Work Order Generator Overview</h3>
  <p>The new Project Manager Work Order Generator is designed to streamline the process of creating a large number of Work Orders to implement a one-time project.  For example, suppose that your firm wins a contract from BigBox to install Gizmos at all of its stores.  This will require hundreds – or thousands – of Work Orders to get the Project completed.  The Project record is the key to the Project Work Order Generator.</p>
  <p class="Support" style="margin-left: 8px;"><img alt="" border="0" src="assets/images/WOGenOrg.png" style="border: none;"/></p>
  <p class="Support"> </p>
  <p>The following records must be configured correctly to run the Start Project Work Order Generator:</p>
  <p><span style="font-weight: bold;">Project:</span><br/>
    The Project specifies the Equipment and Jobs eligible for use in the Create Project Work Order Generator.  Typically, a new Project, Jobs and Equipment would be created for each major Project.  After the Project was completed and billed, the Jobs would be closed, the Equipment marked Inactive, and the Project obsoleted. <span style="font-weight: bold;"> </span></p>
  <p style="margin-left: 48px;"><span style="font-weight: bold;">Job:</span><br/>
    Job records used by the Start Project Work Order must reference the selected Project.  To be used with this function, Jobs should be flagged as Service Compute.</p>
  <p style="margin-left: 48px;"><span style="font-weight: bold;">Site Equipment:</span><br/>
    The Equipment Id must match the Project Id exactly! Complete the Esc. Profile Id if you want Scheduled Events generated for the Work Order. The Default Service Job must point to a Job referencing the Project. The Cost Code and Billing Item must also be completed.</p>
  <p style="margin-left: 48px;"><span style="font-weight: bold;">Milestone Group:</span><br/>
    Defines the Milestone which will be attached to the Work Order. When the Work Order is generated, the Days and Minutes Offset will be used to calculate the End Date and End Time on the Work Order’s Milestone line based on the Date / Time Must Complete.  </p>
  <p style="margin-left: 48px;"><span style="font-weight: bold;">Call Script:</span><br/>
    A Closing Call Script may be applied to the Work Orders if required. <span style="font-weight: bold;"> </span></p>
  <p style="margin-left: 48px;"><span style="font-weight: bold;">Work Code:</span><br/>
    The user may select a Work Code to be applied to the generated Work Orders. The Work Code Id is also used to determine if a matching WO already exists for a given Job.</p>
  <p>Once the records have been correctly configured, Start Project Work Order Generator should be run to create the Work Orders needed to implement the Project.</p>
  <p style="font-weight: bold;"><img alt="" border="0" src="assets/images/WOGenFlow.png" style="border: none;"/></p>
  <h3>16.17.2 Start Project Work Order Generator</h3>
  <h5>Purpose:</h5>
  <p>The Start Project Work Order Generator is used to actually create Service Work Orders defined by the Project, Job and Equipment definitions.  If a Technician is specified in the Equipment record, the Work Order will be assigned to that Tech.</p>
  <h5>Registry:</h5>
  <p>This function is sensitive to the required fields registry settings for sys-start-snwcll. If a field is required in New Call it must be completed or defaulted when this function is run. If not, an information box describing the issue will be displayed and the Work Order will not be generated.</p>
  <h5>Important Fields - Range Screen:</h5>
  <p><span style="font-weight: bold;">Project Id:</span><br/>
    Select the Project you wish to create Work Order for. Jobs must reference the selected Project AND the Client Site Equipment Id MUST MATCH the Project Id in order to be selected for Work Order generation.  </p>
  <p>The Project Id must be completed.  The user will be warned if the Milestone Group, Work Code, or Call Script are blank.</p>
  <p><span style="font-weight: bold;">Milestone Group:</span><br/>
    The Milestone Group defines the Milestones which will be attached to the Work Order.</p>
  <p><span style="font-weight: bold;">Work Code:</span><br/>
    Specifies the Work Code to be assigned to the generated Work Orders. The Work Code Id is also used to determine if a matching WO already exists for a given Job. The Do checkbox on the Checklist screen will NOT be flagged if a Work Order for that Job / Work Code combination exists.</p>
  <p style="font-weight: bold;">Client NTE  - Sub NTE<br/>
    <span style="font-weight: normal;">If these fields are completed, they will provide the defaults for the Work Orders&#39; Client and Sub Not To Exceed (NTE) fields.</span>
  </p>
  <p><span style="font-weight: bold;">Closing Call Script:</span><br/>
    Completing this field specifies the Closing Call Script for the generated Work Orders.</p>
  <p><span style="font-weight: bold;">Date Must Complete:  Time Must Complete:</span><br/>
    Enter the Date and Time that the work for the selected Project must be completed.  These fields will be used to set the Date and Time Scheduled on the Work Order Technician Tab. In addition, the Days and Minutes Offset in the Group and the Date / Time Must Complete will be used to calculate the End Date / Time on the Work Order’s Milestones.</p>
  <p><span style="font-weight: bold;">Default PO#:</span><br/>
    The customer&#39;s PO# for this work; this field will be used to complete the PO# field in the Work Order.</p>
  <p><span style="font-weight: bold;">Dispatcher Id:</span><br/>
    If this field is completed it will provide the default Dispatch Id to use when generating these work orders. If it is left blank, the Dispatcher referenced in the Equipment record will be used.</p>
  <p><span style="font-weight: bold;">Job Id:</span>  <span style="font-weight: bold;">Job Name:</span><br/>
    The Job Id or Name range may be used to filter the Jobs processed by this function.  This would be completed if you did not wish to generate all of the Work Orders for this Project at the same time.</p>
  <p><span style="font-weight: bold;">Project Manager Id:</span><br/>
    This range filters this function to the Project Manager(s) assigned to the Jobs for this Project.</p>
  <p><span style="font-weight: bold;">Site State:</span><br/>
    This range filters this function to the State specified in the Job&#39;s Site record.</p>
  <h5>Checklist Screen:</h5>
  <p>The Checklist displays the results from input filters on the previous screen.</p>
  <p><span style="font-weight: bold;">Do:</span><br/>
    Lines that are presented with the &#39;Do&#39; box checked have been validated and will be used to successfully create a Work Order. If the &#39;Do’ box is not checked, a problem exists for that Equipment or Job.  The user will be informed of the particular problem when attempting to check the Do box (for example, if a Job points to the Project but there isn&#39;t  Equipment for this Job that matches the Project Id).</p>
  <p>If a problem occurs, click Ok, then close the Checklist (with the red X in the upper right-hand corner) and correct the problem. After correcting the problems, rerun the function.</p>
  <p><span style="font-weight: bold;">Milestone Group:  PO#:  Work Code:  Call Script:  <br/>
      Date Must Complete: Time Must Complete: Client NTE:  Sub NTE: Dispatcher Id:</span><br/>
    These fields defaulted from the previous screen, but may be adjusted on the Checklist if needed.</p>
  <h3>16.17.3 New Viewer: Milestone Group</h3>
  <h5>Purpose:</h5>
  <p>The Milestone Group is designed for use with the Start Project Work Order Generator. It will populate the Work Order Milestone tab when the Start Project Work Order Generator creates Work Orders.</p>
  <h5>Important Fields: Upper Section</h5>
  <p><span style="font-weight: bold;">Milestone Group Id:</span><br/>
    A unique name for this Milestone Group.</p>
  <p><span style="font-weight: bold;">Milestone Group Description:</span><br/>
    Briefly identifies the purpose of this Milestone Group.</p>
  <p><span style="font-weight: bold;">Milestone Group User1-5:</span><br/>
    These fields may be used for reporting and other informational purposes.</p>
  <p>
    <font style="font-weight: bold;">Obsolete?</font><br/>
    If this field is checked, the record is considered Obsolete, and it may not be directly specified during data-entry (either by entering the Id or selecting it from a list).
  </p>
  <h5>Important Fields: Lower Section</h5>
  <p><span style="font-weight: bold;">Milestone Id:   Milestone Description:</span><br/>
    Enter a Milestone Id (or double-click to select from a list.  The display-only Milestone Description defaults from the Milestone.</p>
  <p><span style="font-weight: bold;">Description:</span><br/>
    This editable field may be used to better define this Milestone.  Both the Milestone Description and the Description will appear on the Work Order Milestone tab.</p>
  <p><span style="font-weight: bold;">Days Offset:  Minutes Offset:</span><br/>
    When the Work Order is generated, the Days and Minutes Offset will be used to calculate the End Date and End Time on the Work Order’s Milestone line based on the Date / Time Must Complete. <span style="font-weight: bold;"> </span></p>
  <p>For example, if the Work Order was generated with a Date Must Complete of April 15, 2017 a Days Offset of 10 would generate Milestone End Date of April 25, 2017.  Negative Offsets may also be specified.  In the above example, a Days Offset of -10 would generate an End Date of April 5, 2017.</p>
  <p><span style="font-weight: bold;">Fixed Date:  Fixed Time:</span><br/>
    Milestone Dates and Times are set during initial WO creation regardless of whether these fields are flagged.  These fields come into play in the Work Order viewer when Date/Time Must Complete is changed.  Basically, Fixed means  do NOT change the Milestone’s End Date / Time after the initial Work Order creation.</p>
  <h3>16.17.4  Work Order Viewer</h3>
  <p style="font-weight: bold;">New Tab: Milestones</p>
  <p>Work Order Milestones are typically referenced by DBAnalytics for tracking purposes for Work Orders generated by the Start Project Work Order Generator function.</p>
  <h5>Important Fields:</h5>
  <p><span style="font-weight: bold;">Milestone Id:</span>  <br/>
    Milestones are automatically populated by the Start Project Work Order Generator function when WO&#39;s are generated.</p>
  <p>They may also be added to any Work Order for reporting purposes.</p>
  <p style="margin-left: 48px;"><span style="font-weight: bold;">Tip:</span> If using the Milestones on a manually created Work Order, first set the Date Must Complete and the Time Must Complete and SAVE the Work Order before added the Milestones. The Milestone&#39;s End Date/Time are controlled by the Days/Time Offset fields and the Work Order&#39;s Date/Time must complete.</p>
  <p><span style="font-weight: bold;">End Date: End Time:</span><br/>
    This field specifies when this Milestone should be completed.</p>
  <p style="margin-left: 48px;">If this Milestone line was populated by the Start Project Work Order Generator function, the End Date and Time are initially based on the Date and Time Must Complete specified in the function, and the Days and Minutes Offsets of each Milestone.</p>
  <p style="margin-left: 48px;">If the Date / Time Must Complete is changed in the Work Order’s Main tab,  Milestones NOT flagged as ‘Fixed’ will have their End Date / Time fields updated automatically on the new Date/Tab and the value of the Offset fields.  </p>
  <p style="margin-left: 48px;">If the user changes the Milestone&#39;s End Date/Time, the Days/Time Offset fields will automatically be updated (if the Fixed Date / Time boxes are not checked).</p>
  <p style="margin-left: 48px;">If the Fixed Time / Date fields are flagged on a Milestone, changing the Work Order&#39;s Date/Time Must Complete does NOT change the Milestone’s End Date / Time fields.</p>
  <p style="margin-left: 8px;"><span style="font-weight: bold;">Milestone Description:</span><br/>
    This display field defaults from the Milestone record.</p>
  <p style="margin-left: 8px;"><span style="font-weight: bold;">Description:</span><br/>
    This field is set from the Milestone Group if this line was generated when the Start Project Work Order Generator function was run, It may be changed by the user if needed.</p>
  <p style="margin-left: 8px;"><span style="font-weight: bold;">Days Offset:  Minutes Offset:</span><br/>
    When a Work Order first generated, the Days and Minutes Offset will be used to calculate the End Date and End Time on the Work Order’s Milestone line based on the Date / Time Must Complete.  For example, if the Work Order was generated with a Date Must Complete of April 15, 2017 a Days Offset of 10 would generate Milestone End Date of April 25, 2017.  Negative Offsets may also be specified.  In the above example, a Days Offset of -10 would generate an End Date of April 5, 2017.</p>
  <p style="margin-left: 8px;">If the Work Order&#39;s Date / Time Must Complete is updated, the Milestone&#39;s new End Date / Time will also be updated using these offsets if this Milestone is not flagged as Fixed Date / Time.</p>
  <p style="margin-left: 8px;"><span style="font-weight: bold;">Fixed Date:  Fixed Time:</span><br/>
    Milestone Dates and Times are set during initial WO creation regardless of whether these fields are flagged.  These fields come into play in the Work Order viewer when Date/Time Must Complete is changed.  Basically, Fixed means  do NOT change the Milestone’s End Date / Time after the initial Work Order creation.</p>
  <p style="margin-left: 8px;">
    <font style="font-weight: bold;">Completed?</font><br/>
    Check this field if this Milestone has been completed. If the Completed flag is checked the Milestone cannot be changed.

  <p style="margin-left: 8px;">When a user had the Gross Margin tab open and made changes to the Labor, Inventory, or Other tabs and then saved, the Gross Margin tab did not display the changes made. When a user clicked save a second time or went to another tab on the top and back to the Gross Margin tab, it would display the updated Gross Margin tab. The 9.1.611.062 update corrects this defect and the changes to the Gross Margin tab saves the first time. </p>
  <p style="margin-left: 8px;">From 9.1.611.059 and up, enhanced the time required to open/load a work order in the Work Order Viewer by delaying the Gross Margin calculations until the Gross Margin tab is selected.</p>
  <p style="margin-left: 8px;">From 9.1.611.059 and up, the Word Order Log tab is now sorted by most recent date/time logged; previously the sort was by oldest data/time logged first. This allows the user to see the most recent changes without having to scroll down to the bottom of the screen. </p>
  <h3>16.17.5 Project WO Generator Registry to Err / Warn on Closed Jobs</h3>
  <p>Start Project Work Order Generator has been refined so that when closed jobs are pulled into the checklist, the Do button will not be checked. A new registry (below) will control if you are allowed to change the Do flag.</p>
  <p>Note: the Job&#39;s Date Closed is compared with the functions Date Must Complete.  A Job is considered &#39;closed&#39; for this function if it&#39;s Date Closed precedes the Date Must Complete.</p>
  <p><span style="font-weight: bold;">Registry Id:</span> sys-start-sprjctwrkordrgnrtr</p>
  <p><span style="font-weight: bold;">Setting Key:</span> ClosedJob      <span style="font-weight: bold;">Setting Value:</span> error  (default warning)</p>
  <p><span>In absence of registry or with setting value &quot;warning&quot; allow user to check Do, and give warning. If registry is set to error, do not allow user to check Do, and display an error message. </span></p>
  <h2>16.18 Web Log</h2>
  <p style="font-weight: bold;">List View:<br/>
    <span style="font-weight: normal;">A new Sort Order, WebLogByWorkOrderByClientSiteName has been added. This Sort Order also displays the Web Log&#39;s Tech Id (of the Tech who added a recommendation and generated the Web Log), Date and Time Logged, and the Work Requested.</span>
  </p>
  <p style="font-weight: bold; margin-left: 48px;">Range View - <span style="font-weight: bold;">New Ranges:</span></p>
  <p style="font-weight: bold; margin-left: 48px;">Dispatcher Id:<br/>
    <span style="font-weight: normal;">This range may be used to filter Web Logs based on the Dispatcher referenced in the Client Site record.</span>
  </p>
  <p style="margin-left: 48px;"><span style="font-weight: bold;">Technician Id:</span><br/>
    This range may be used to filter on the Web Log&#39;s Tech Id (the Tech who added a recommendation and generated the Web Log).</p>
  <p style="margin-left: 48px;"><span style="font-weight: bold;">Work Code:</span><br/>
    The Work Code Id has been substituted for Service Category Id on the viewer&#39;s Find Data range screen. This prevents an error when filtering by Service Category in the Web Log.  </p>
  <p><span style="font-weight: bold;">Web Log Viewer:</span><br/>
    The Work Requested display field has been expanded from 4 to 14 lines. A revised customization file is required to see this change unless upgrading to this version. .</p>
  <h2>16.19 Start Auto Archive Work Orders</h2>
  <p>This release corrects a key is missing error running this starter function with the sys-start-sautoarchivewo registry enabled.</p>
  <h2>16.20 Scheduled Event Manager</h2>
  <p>This update corrects a defect where sending emails with headers and logos caused errors when triggered by web log. This was caused by one of the following:<br/>
    -The current code assumed that Escalation is triggered by a Work Order and therefore the Escalation Profile could be determined by joining to the Work Order table using the Scheduled Event Source Id.<br/>
    -The Escalation is triggered by a Web Log.</p>
  <p>This release eliminates unnecessary updates to Scheduled Event&#39;s Record Change Logs. Also streamlines Token Replacement code in the SEM to prevent excess memory usage.</p>
  <p>The system no longer pops up a message when a scheduled report is generated from an escalation profile event. In previous releases, reports auto-generated from an escalation profile would cause a message to display when the report was added the report queue. This would cause the scheduled events manager to stop running until the message was cleared. This could be controlled by configuring the batch file running scheduled events with the switch -messageBoxSuppress=yes enabled, but this was not the best solution.</p>
  <h2>16.21 Start Daily Work Order Edit</h2>
  <p>This update adds an &quot;Override Tech&quot; field and an “Override All Techs?” checkbox to the WO Daily Edit screen. This allows the user to select a single technician from a drop-down menu containing all active technicians and when the checkbox is enabled, the Override Tech would override all techs when it displays.</p>
  <p><span style="color: rgba(var(--palette-neutral-100, 0, 0, 0), 1); box-sizing: border-box;">The Refresh / Update button has been removed from the Work Order Daily Edit Checklist screen to prevent the &quot;Adjust Current Field Note Understood&quot; error. </span></p>
  <p>Validation prevents the user from entering an invalid Tech Status on the Range Screen&#39;s New Status field as well as on the Checklist screen.</p>
  <p>This release avoids a Runtime error: RnFetchErrorForKeyName  by preventing the user from scrolling the Start Work Order Daily Edit checklist when Go has been clicked and the Work Orders are being updated.</p>
  <h2>16.22 Scheduled Report Manager</h2>
  <p>Previously, if no repeat time was specified, scheduled reports would trigger in an infinite loop triggering every minute. To prevent this, an error message pops up to the user preventing them to leave without adding a specified time when the Repeat Event box is checked.<br/>
    Also, to ensure that the user has input a time when repeating, &quot;Repeat Options&quot; on the scheduled report viewer is now added to the same section in the scheduled event viewer for reports.<br/>
    In addition, this update prevents users from attempting to make edits that should be done via navigating to the report and then scheduling the report.</p>

  <p>This function also eliminates the requirement that Work Orders must have Required Resource entries to be eligible for this function to support the scenario that a Work Order references only a PO with $Based Sub lines.</p>
  <h2>18.5 Start Material Requisitioning</h2>
  <p style="margin-left: 8px;"><span style="font-weight: bold;">New Field: Company Id:</span> This field should be completed if Intercompany Processing is enabled. Intercompany filtering is made via the Work Order table.</p>

  <p>This new behavior must be implemented by running the Start Function List Update.</p>
  <p>New Range Screen</p>
  <p><span style="font-weight: bold;">Location Id:</span><br/>
    To run Start Backorder Filling for a specific Location, complete the Location Id field and then click the Go button.  The SAMPro Backorder Filling screen will then appear, filtered to Location selected in the Range Screen.  Note that selecting a Location is optional; leaving the Location Id blank will result in all applicable Locations be processed for Backorder Filling.</p>
  <h3>18.7.1  Back Order Updates</h3>
  <p>Previously, the system was relieving the entire backorder quantity in the &quot;clntordrtoshp&quot; table, NOT just the amount of the backorder that was actually filled. This caused issues when an order was NOT flagged “Allow Partial Ship” as the system allowed the printing of Pick Tickets for those ordered items that are fully allocated. Now, when “Allow Partial Ship” box is NOT flagged the system prevents the printing of any Pick Ticket until all items are fully allocated. </p>
  <h1>19 TechAnywhere</h1>
  <h2>19.1 TechAnywhere Registries</h2>
  <h3>19.1.1 Registry to Attach TechAnywhere Collateral Files to the Job Record</h3>
  <p style="margin-left: 8px;">This new registry tells the post whether or not to include a reference to the Work Order&#39;s Job in the Document records created from the uploaded collateral.  Note that collateral files will always be attached to the Work Order and to the Equipment record referenced in the TA Collateral List.  The collateral being posted from TechAnywhere would add a document reference to the Job from the Work Order.</p>

  <p style="margin-left: 8px;">When an Inventory PO is created in TechAnywhere, the Cost Category now defaults from the Item&#39;s Inventory Group.  If the Cost Category is not set in the Inventory Group, this registry is used as a backup to derive the Cost Category.</p>
  <h3>19.1.3 Registry to Keep Date and Account Period in Sync for Work Order Other Lines</h3>
  <p>When Work Order Other lines are posted from TechAnywhere, the system will now adjust the Date or Accounting period based on the following existing sys-techanywhere registry. This will ensure that the Effective Date and Accounting Period are in sync. This is important for clients using the Accounting Period&#39;s WO Other to G/L? option. If the registry is not set, the default Accounting Period will be used and no check will be made to ensure that the Effective Date falls within the Account Period.</p>

  <p><span style="font-weight: bold;">Setting Key:</span> AdjustDefaultDateOrPeriod  <span style="font-weight: bold;">Setting Value:</span>  Period or Date</p>
  <h3>19.1.4 TechAnywhere Posting Style</h3>
  <p>In this version, COD and (and other PO changes) are successfully handled since the Billable Quantity and Price updates are posted to the Purchase Order so the standard posting method is now the default. See Customer Note 4.1.3 for details on changes to this Purchase Order registry.</p>
  <h3>19.1.5 Limit TechAnywhere Messages Per Posting Cycle</h3>
  <p>This release should improve the overall posting of TechAnywhere by limiting the number of messages TechAnywhere would post per cycle by adding a TOP N. What this does is limit the messages posted during the Start TechAnywhere Post function, which allows for more time for the TechAnywhere Event Manager to post its type of messages which tend to have higher importance (status changes, new work order creation, etc.).  A default value of 10 messages is specified if the registry doesn&#39;t exist.</p>
  <p>The following registry may be used to adjust the number of messages posted per cycle.<span style="font-weight: bold;"> </span></p>

  <h3>19.1.6 Override Job Cost Code for Inventory Items</h3>
  <p>SAMPro Version 9.1.611.0056 adds the ability (via registry) to specify a Job Cost Code to be used to override the Work Order Default Job Cost Code when the TechAnywhere posting service posts inventory line items to the WO Inventory child tab.</p>
  <p>The overriding Job Cost Code will also be used when TechAnywhere PO&#39;s are created for Inventory items. The registry has an option default for all inventory items or just those marked &quot;Stocked.&quot;</p>
  <p><span style="font-weight: bold;">Registry:</span> sys-techanywhere</p>
  <p><span style="font-weight: bold;">Setting Key:</span> inventorycostcodeid   <span style="font-weight: bold;">Setting Value:</span> <span style="font-style: italic;">CostCodeId</span></p>
  <p>Note that all Service Invoice jobs should have the Job Cost Code Id specified in this registry.</p>
  <p><span style="font-weight: bold;">Setting Key:</span> inventorycostcodeuse  <span style="font-weight: bold;">Setting Value:</span> (blank) or stocked</p>
  <p>If the Setting Value is set to stocked, only Inventory Items flagged as Stocked will use the override Job Cost Code.</p>
  <h2>19.2 Reports</h2>
  <h2>19.3 TechAnywhere Post</h2>
  <p>Version 9.1.611.056 corrects a recent false negative error when posting to new Quotes: &#39;Unit Price must be zero for fixed price Options Codes - Posting to New Quotes has Failed&#39;.</p>
  <p>The TechAnywhere Event manager now displays informative progress messages when posting. It is hoped that this will prevent users from downing this function with the Task Manager when they erroneously think it is hung up.</p>
  <p><span style="font-weight: bold;">Errors:</span> When the TechAnywhere Post was run, displayed errors could cause the TechAnywhere Event Manager to &#39;crash&#39; until the error was manually cleared. Instead of displaying errors on the screen, the TechAnywhere post now writes useful error messages to the failed TechAnywhere message.</p>
  <p><span style="font-weight: bold;">Flat Rates:</span> In this release, when a Flat Rate is referenced, the price from TechAnywhere is always used. Previously, if the price was adjusted using any other price level than 1, the TechAnywhere price override was ignored.</p>
  <p><span style="font-weight: bold;">Labor:</span> This release removes the Supervisor logic for TechAnywhere as this never should have been added. This functionality is available in TimeAnywhere.</p>
  <p><span style="font-weight: bold;">Labor:</span> The Labor Post now follows the Labor Journal Registry to Use Default Service Job in the Equipment record for all but PM WO’s. See Customer Note 12.1.15 for the registry.</p>
  <p style="font-weight: bold;">Collateral Documents: <span style="font-weight: normal;">TechAnywhere now writes errors to the TechAnywhere Message Directory if a collateral Document fails to post so that the issue can be tracked.</span></p>
  <p style="margin-left: 8px;"><span style="font-weight: bold;">Purchase Orders:</span> PO&#39;s will not be updated by the post if no values have changed. This will preclude failed message when the post attempts to update a closed PO.</p>
  <p style="margin-left: 8px;">During purchase order creation from TechAnywhere, SAMPro now takes into account the bill quantity for both inventory and general items. This should correct posting issues to closed PO&#39;s for customers who are using COD Flat Rate and having techs create POs.</p>
  <p style="margin-left: 8px;"><span style="font-weight: bold;">Quotes:</span></p>
  <p style="margin-left: 48px;">In previous releases, when posting a TechAnywhere Quote, SAMPro generated the Quote Id. In this release, the Quote Id provided by TechAnywhere is used instead.</p>
  <p style="margin-left: 48px;">This release corrects a sporadic problem where TechAnywhere combined all outstanding quotes into one message resulting in all scopes being written to all quotes created by the post.</p>
  <p style="margin-left: 48px;">This release sets the Web Viewable Tech flag to Y for posted TechAnywhere Quote Attachments. In previous releases, the Web Viewable Tech flag was set to N.</p>
  <p style="margin-left: 8px;"><span style="font-weight: bold;">Taylor UWO:</span> This fix applies to customers using the Taylor Universal Work Order functionality. It corrects a &#39;Key is Missing&#39; error when posting Work Order COD information.</p>
  <p style="margin-left: 8px;">This release supports subfolder logic when a file is archived after a delay; previously, these files were archived in the base archive directory.  </p>
  <p>The Unit Cost entered by the Tech Material and Other lines now posts back to SAMPro so that the Quote&#39;s costs are correct.</p>
  <p style="margin-left: 8px;">To improve performance, the Post now applies a 90 Day cutoff date for documents so that it no longer attempts to archive documents which can likely never be archived. .  </p>
  <p style="margin-left: 8px;"><span style="text-indent: -.5pt;">E</span>quipment created from the Timesheet is now assigned Security from the Site if applicable.</p>
  <p style="text-indent: -.5pt;">This release corrects Out of Memory Error when Posting Large Messages.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes;"> </span></p>
  <p>This release makes the determination of a TA PO&#39;s posting style more accurate.</p>
  <p style="margin-left: 8px;">The Tax Type is now set correctly when Flat Rates are posted from TechAnywhere.</p>
  <p style="margin-left: 8px;">PO&#39;s generated in TechAnywhere now have their Company / Security set from the Work Order that the material was purchased for. </p>
  <p style="margin-left: 8px;">This release corrects a problem in the TechAnywhere Post cause by the override of the Labor Rate by the Job Cost Category.</p>
  <h3>19.3.1 TechAnywhere PO Receipt Post</h3>
  <p>In Version 9.1.611.047, when the PO is closed, and there were no changes to be made based on BillQty, the message would fail because changes are not allowed to a closed PO (case 6100). This release corrects false positive-type errors on closed POs. When there are no changes to the PO, the message will post successfully since it is not actually updating the closed PO with any information.</p>
  <p style="margin-left: 8px; font-weight: normal;">When a PO message from TechAnywhere fails (e.g., due to expired insurance), the Vendor Id and Name are now included in the TechAnywhere Error Alert email to make it easier to identify problems with the Vendor.</p>
  <p style="margin-left: 8px;">This release corrects a recent where TechAnywhere post did not update the Job Quantity Ordered and Job Quantity Received on the PO from TechAnywhere.</p>
  <p>In previous releases, the TechAnywhere PO Receipt Post could select the incorrect Accounting Period/Effective Date. Typically, this would occur around the time of an accounting period changeover (beginning of the month) due to the Information warning/error &quot;EffectiveDateNotInPeriodRange&quot; causing the TechAnywhere Event Manager to stop running until cleared. For example, if the default accounting period was still December, posting with a  January 1st date could generate Information warning/error &quot;EffectiveDateNotInPeriodRange&quot; causing the TechAnywhere Event Manager to stop running until cleared.</p>
  <p>In this release, the PO Receipt Post now adjusts the Accounting Period match the Effective Date if possible.  The following registry entry may be used to override the default behavior and instead set the effective date to fall within the Default Accounting Period to the default Effective Date. In most cases, the default functionality (period) is preferred. <span style="font-weight: bold;">This entry (and the new default behavior) only impacts the TechAnywhere Receipt Post, not manual entries.</span></p>
  <p><span style="font-weight: bold;">Id:</span> sys-viewer-vinvntryrcpt</p>
  <p><span style="font-weight: bold;">Setting Key:</span> AdjustDefaultDateOrPeriod  <span style="font-weight: bold;">Setting Value:</span> period or date  (default is period)</p>
  <p><span style="text-decoration: underline; ">When period is specified:</span><br/>
    The Accounting Period table is queried for eligible Accounting Periods.  To qualify, the period must be Active and its date range must include the defaulted Effective Date.  When multiple periods are eligible, the one with the smallest Period Id is chosen to become the new Accounting Period for the current transaction.  If no eligible period is found, nothing is changed.</p>
  <p><span style="text-decoration: underline; ">When date specified:.</span><br/>
    The Effective Date is adjusted to be either the Start Date or the End Date of the defaulted Accounting Period.  The Start Date is chosen when the current date is less than the Start Date.  The End Date is chosen when the current date is greater than the End Date.<br/>
    <br/>
    In the absence of the new setting, it uses the &#39;adjust period&#39; behavior described above as default.
  </p>
  <h2>19.4 TechAnywhere - Work Order Call Script Tab</h2>
  <p><span style="font-weight: bold;">New Field: Tech Id</span><br/>
    This field is updated whenever Call Script info is being posted/updated by TechAnywhere.</p>
  <h2><span style="font-weight: bold;">19.5 TechAnywhere New Call</span></h2>
  <p style="margin-left: 8px;">When a Work Order is created in TechAnywhere, its Client and Sub NTE fields now default from the Site Equipment record. If these fields are not set in the Equipment record, they will default from the Site record. These fields were not previously set when a Work Order was created in TechAnywhere.</p>
  <h2>19.6 TechAnywhere Timesheet</h2>
  <p style="margin-left: 8px;">When Equipment is created from the TechAnywhere Timesheet, the Equipment Name now defaults to Pending instead of the Equipment Id to correct an issue with Custom Fields Settings. If Custom Field values are specified for the Equipment Name, Pending must be one of the allowable options.</p>
  <h2>19.7 TechAnywhere Equipment </h2>
  <p>This update adds a “Unit Down” checkbox to TechAnywhere. When checked, a prompt appears to confirm or choose the Equipment Type from a list of SAMPro Equipment Type IDsn and to choose the Cause Code from a list of SAMPro Cause Code IDs.</p>
  <p>TechAnywhere <span style="mso-fareast-font-family: &#39;Times New Roman&#39;;">Version 4.0.058.008</span> allows the Technician to replace one piece of equipment with another. <span style="mso-fareast-font-family: &#39;Times New Roman&#39;;">This functionality must be enabled in TechAnywhere if desired.</span> From TechAnywhere, the Tech can mark an old equipment record as replaced from the field and create a new equipment record and link it to the old to record equipment that it replaced. This functionality may only be initiated from TechAnywhere.</p>
  <p style="font-weight: bold;">Site Equipment Service Tab<br/>
    New Fields: Replacement Equipment Id:   Replacement (Date):<br/>
    <span style="font-weight: normal;">These display fields will be completed if the currently selected Equipment Id was replaced by the Replacement Equipment Id on the Replacement date listed from TechAnywhere. If the selected Equipment has NOT been tagged as replaced, these fields well be blank.</span>
  </p>
  <p>When a TechAnywhere Tech decides to replace equipment (Ex. RTU-1), the following will happen as the Replacement Procedure is implemented during the TechAnywhere Post:</p>
  <p style="margin-left: 48px;">Rename original Equipment record from RTU-1 to RTU-1-R</p>
  <p style="margin-left: 48px;">If RTU-1-R already exists (was replaced in the past), use RTU-1-R2, RTU-1-R3 and so on. Note we skipped &#39;R1&#39; as it makes more sense to do so.</p>
  <p style="margin-left: 48px;">Set the Replacement Equipment Field to link the new RTU-1 equipment to be created soon after.</p>
  <p style="margin-left: 48px;">Set the Date Replaced with the current date.</p>
  <p style="margin-left: 48px;">Set the Deny TA Access flag to Yes, so the old equipment is no longer accessible from TechAnywhere.</p>
  <p style="margin-left: 48px;">The New replacement equipment will be submitted when the technician completes the work order. The new equipment will have the same ID as the original, RTU-1.</p>
  <p style="margin-left: 48px;">You are now left with 2 equipment records. The new RTU-1, and the old RTU-1-R.</p>
  <h3>19.7.1 Previously Replaced Equipment</h3>
  <p style="margin-left: 8px;">This release contains a refinement to this functionality. If the message payload being posted contains a &#39;ReplacedWith&#39; RN value that has already previously been replaced, do not replace the equipment again (ignore going through the equipment replacement code). This scenario can happen because TechAnywhere maintains this RN value throughout the life of that equipment in the TechAnywhere database. It&#39;s possible for this equipment record to send multiple times (in different messages). This change prevents the Equipment from erroneously being replaced.</p>
  <h3>19.8  Require a PCR Table for New Equipment</h3>
  <p style="font-weight: bold;">Client Site Service Tab</p>
  <p><span style="font-weight: bold;">New Field - PCR Table Id:</span><br/>
    This field is used by TechAnywhere to indicate that Equipment linked to this Site requires a PCR Table. If it is completed, TechAnywhere will force technicians to pick a PCR table ID whenever adding new equipment for a Site with this field completed.</p>
  <p>This field also provides the new default value for new Equipment created for this Site in SAMPro.</p>
  <h2><span style="font-weight: bold;">19.9 Technician Statuses</span></h2>
  <p>If Technicians should have access to any of the new statuses (Parts Backorder, Parts Issue, Parts Shipped and Wait Tracking), their TechAnywhere configuration will need to be customized.</p>
  <h2><span style="font-weight: bold;">19.20 Work Order User Fields</span> </h2>
  <p>This SAMPro release allows specified Work Order User fields to be viewed / modified by TechAnywhere. This functionality must be enabled via the appropriate TechAnywhere configurations. Specific User fields may be configured as read-only. Contact your TechAnywhere support rep for details.</p>
  <h2>19.21 <span style="font-weight: bold;">TechAnywhere Document Uploads</span></h2>
  <p>A document cannot be opened when it is pending the TechAnywhere upload. This release clarifies the message and provides a way to correct the problem.  If this is the case, the following message will be displayed:</p>
  <p style="margin-left: 48px;">&quot;This document has not finished uploading from TechAnywhere and is still Pending.<br/>
    Please have the technician complete the upload of the document with a manual sync in TechAnywhere&quot;</p>
  <p style="margin-left: 48px;">Previously, Work Order Attachments from TechAnywhere were not posting with security since receiving the 9.1.611.054 update. This update corrects this defect.</p>
  <h2>19.22 Tech Anywhere Quote</h2>
  <p>When a technician submits a quote for approval, the email subject will have the technician Id of the person who created the quote in the subject line of the email.<br/>
    Id: sys-techanywhere    setting key:QuoteEmailIncludeSubmittedBy    Setting value: True</p>
  <h1>20 Service Channel</h1>
  <p style="margin-left: 8px;">This release corrects issues experienced by some Canadian users uploading invoices. The Invoice Date is now sent in US format even for Canadian users for the I12 and I14 ServiceChannel Invoice Formats.</p>
  <p>This release supports Work Order Ids that have characters in them (e.g., prepended with a Branch Id).</p>
  <p>This release corrects an error ServiceChannel encountered updating a Weblog record. Also decodes Nancy accented vowels (as found in French) to their non-accented ASCII Equivalents.</p>
  <p>Corrects handling of non-printing characters in the Work Requested when a new Web Log record is generated from ServiceChannel.</p>
  <p>Incorrectly configured ServiceChannel responses now place a diagnostic message in the offending message record. The invalid response is otherwise ignored so posting is not interrupted.</p>
  <h2>20.1 Service Channel Registries</h2>
  <h3><span style="text-indent: -.25in;">20.1.1 Registry to Map Work Codes and Equipment Id&#39;s</span></h3>
  <p><span style="text-indent: -.25in; mso-list: l1 level1 lfo2; mso-bidi-font-family: &#39;Courier New&#39;;">N</span>ew registries support setting the Work Code based on the Service Channel Priority, and the Equipment based on the Trade Code.</p>

  <p style="margin-left: 8px;"><span style="font-weight: bold;">Setting Key:</span> UploadEquipmentWorkPerformedNotes</p>
  <p style="margin-left: 8px;"><span style="font-weight: bold;">Setting Value:</span> Y</p>
  <p style="margin-left: 8px;">Note that values of Y, y, T, or t enable this mod; the default is that this mod is not enabled. When this option is enabled, Work Order&#39;s Work Performed is now sent as Notes to ServiceChannel whenever a Status update is sent.</p>
  <p style="margin-left: 48px;">A Work Order Note is sent to ServiceChannel for each Equipment line in the Work Order.</p>
  <p style="margin-left: 48px;">The Note includes the contents of the Work Order Equipment Work Performed field.</p>
  <p style="margin-left: 48px;">Each note is prefixed with the Equipment Id, Manufacturer, Model, and Serial Number.</p>
  <p style="margin-left: 8px;">If this option is not enabled, the Work Performed will be included in a &lt;RESOL&gt; sub-element of the &lt;CALL&gt; element when a status change is sent.</p>
  <h5>20.1.4a Registry to Disable Uploading Equipment Work Performed by Equipment Id</h5>
  <p>The previous registry enables a feature that sends a Work Order Note to ServiceChannel for each equipment line on a work order. This registry allows the upload feature to be disabled for specified Equipment Ids. This new registry option may be used to refine which Equipment Id&#39;s have their Work Performed uploaded to ServiceChannel.  The value of this key is a comma separated list of Equipment Ids to be excluded from the Note sending operation.</p>

    <span style="font-weight: bold;">Setting Value:</span> Y   (note that this setting is also required)
  </p>
  <p>The following example would prevent the sending of Work Order Notes for Client Site Equipment Id &#39;RTU2&#39;, but allow that for all other Equipment Id&#39;s to be sent.</p>
  <p style="margin-left: 48px;"><span style="font-weight: bold;">Setting Key:</span> UploadEquipmentWorkPerformedNotesExceptEquipment  </p>

  <p><span style="font-weight: bold;">Note:</span><br/>
    The Service Channel i.14 invoice template requires that materials are used to complete the job; ServiceChannel will reject the invoice if it doesn&#39;t contain material information. Since all jobs do not require materials, this release will add a dummy $0 material line to get around this requirement. The Material Description of &#39;No Material Required&#39; will be used on the $0 line to conform to ServiceChannel requirements.</p>
  <h3>20.1.6 Registry to Disable Sending ETA Updates to ServiceChannel / FacilitySource / Corrigo</h3>
  <p>This registry disables sending ETA changes to ServiceChannel when a SAMPro Work Order&#39;s ETA changes.</p>
  <p><span style="font-weight: bold;">Id:</span> sys-fmms-vendor-ServiceChannel  / sys-fmms-vendor-FacilitySource / sys-fmms-vendor-Corrigo</p>
  <p><span style="font-weight: bold;">Setting Key:</span> UploadWorkorderETAChanges  <span style="font-weight: bold;">Setting Value:</span> No   (default is Yes)</p>
  <p>Note this setting is applicable to all FMMS Subsystems (e.g. Corrigo, FacilitySource). Any value beginning with &#39;Y&#39;, &#39;y&#39;, &#39;T&#39;, or &#39;t&#39; is equivalent to &#39;Yes&#39; and any other value is equivalent to &#39;No&#39;. The absence of the Registry entry is equivalent to a &#39;Yes&#39; value. So there will be no change in functionality if the Registry entry is not found.</p>
  <h3>20.1.7 Registry to Disable Updating SAMPro Work Order Status from Service Channel IVR Messages</h3>
  <p>This registry may be used to disable the updating a SAMPro Work Order&#39;s status based on IVR Check-In and Check-Out messages received from ServiceChannel.</p>
  <p><span style="font-weight: bold;">Id:</span>  sys-fmms-vendor-ServiceChannel</p>
  <p><span style="font-weight: bold;">Setting Key:</span>  PostIncomingStatusUpdates   <span style="font-weight: bold;">Setting Value:</span>  No  (default is Yes)</p>
  <p>Any value beginning with &#39;Y&#39;, &#39;y&#39;, &#39;T&#39;, or &#39;t&#39; is equivalent to &#39;Yes&#39; and any other value is equivalent to &#39;No&#39;. The absence of the Registry entry is equivalent to a &#39;Yes&#39; value. So there will be no change in functionality if the Registry entry is not found.</p>
  <h3>20.1.8 Registry to Define Statuses Exempt from Inbound IVR Status Change Message</h3>
  <p>ServiceChannel provides an IVR facility that allows techs to phone into them with a change to a Workorder&#39;s status. This change is then forwarded to SAMPro for posting to the SAMPro Workorder. Sometimes it becomes necessary (for ServiceChannel internal reasons) for a tech to make such a IVR entry for a Workorder that has a &#39;finished&#39; status (e.g. &#39;billed&#39;) within SAMPro. In this release, we prohibit SAMPro from updating a Workorder&#39;s status in response to such an inbound IVR status change message for ‘Cancelled’ and ‘Billed’ Work Orders. Note that the Work Order’s current status is derived from the wrkordrlgtype_id on the first line of the Workorder’s Technicians tab.  </p>
  <p>This functionality may adjusted via registry.</p>
  <p>
    <font style="font-weight: bold;">Id: <span style="font-weight: normal;">sys-fmms-vendor-ServiceChannel</span></font>
  </p>
  <p>
    <font style="font-weight: bold;"><span style="font-weight: bold;">Setting Key:</span> </font>StatusUpdateIsProhibitedForStatusCodes  <span style="font-weight: bold;">Setting Value:</span> listofstatuscodes
  </p>
  <p>The Setting Value is a list of status codes separated commas. The codes ‘Cancelled’ and ‘Billed’ are always automatically added to the list. If no entry is found, the list will consist solely of these two entries.</p>
  <h3>20.1.9 Check-In and Check-Out Messages to ServiceChannel with Check Element</h3>
  <p>When SAMPro detects certain Status changes to a Work Order, it sends ServiceChannel a CALL XML message that includes TR_NUM and the new ServiceChannel STATUS code. When entering certain Status values, ServiceChannel would like us to include a CHECK element within the CALL XML. The CHECK element  includes a TYPE code which corresponds to the new Status Code.</p>
  <h5>Identify ‘CHECK TYPE’ Values Corresponding to ServiceChannel Work Order Status Codes.</h5>
  <p><span style="font-weight: bold;">Registry Id:</span> sys-FMMS-Vendor-ServiceChannel</p>
  <p><span style="font-weight: bold;">Setting Key:</span> CheckTypeForServiceChannelStatus</p>
  <p><span style="font-weight: bold;">Setting Value:</span> ServiceChannelStatusCode:CorrespondingCHECKTypeCode</p>
  <p style="margin-left: 48px;">1. There may be multiple Registry lines with the ‘CheckTypeForServiceChannelStatus’ key.</p>
  <p style="margin-left: 48px;">2. Each line may consist of multiple mappings with individual mappings separated by a ‘,’ character.</p>
  <p style="margin-left: 48px;">3. The Valid CHECK Type Codes are: IN, OUT, DISP, and CLOSE</p>
  <p style="margin-left: 88px; text-decoration: underline; ">Example:</p>
  <p style="margin-left: 88px;">Setting Key: CheckTypeForServiceChannelStatus<br/>
    Setting Value: ON_SITE:IN, COMPLETED:OUT</p>
  <p style="margin-left: 48px;">4. If a mapping is not found (or evaluates to ‘N/A’), no CHECK element will be included in the CALL XML.</p>
  <p style="margin-left: 48px;">5. There being several ServiceChannel Status Codes beginning with ‘COMPLETED’ , a special ‘short cut’ is available for those Status Codes: If no mapping is found (or if an ‘N/A’ mapping is found)  for a Status Code and the Status Code begins with ‘COMPLETED’, SAMPro will try to identify and use a mapping for the ‘COMPLETED’ status code.</p>
  <h5>Check In and Check Out Sequencing via the CHECK element’s ID property.</h5>
  <p>Check elements include an ‘ID’ attribute that ServiceChannel uses to internally sequence Check Ins and Check Outs. The restrictions are:</p>
  <p>1. Each Check In process should be identified by an ID attribute value greater in value than that used in any prior Check In processes.</p>
  <p>2. Each Check Out process should be identified by an ID attribute that matches that used in the corresponding Check In process.</p>
  <p>In order to implement this sequencing, SAMPro must somewhere retain the appropriate Check Sequencing information. This has been implemented as follows:</p>
  <p>1. Sequencing information will be retained on one of the Work Order’s User Fields.</p>
  <p>2. The User Field to be used will be identified in the following registry entry by the line having the key ‘. The value of this key should be a number between 1 and 5 inclusive.</p>

  <p style="margin-left: 48px;"><span style="font-weight: bold;">Setting Value:</span> <span style="font-style: italic;">a number between 1 and 5 inclusive.</span></p>
  <p>3. The chosen User Field in the Work Order should be customized to ‘SC In/Out Count:’.</p>
  <p>4. If no ‘WOUserFieldNumberForCheckInCheckOut’ key is found, the value of the next RN will be used for the ID attribute. This will not result in proper sequencing.</p>
  <p>5. The format of the In/Out Count field will be of the form ‘inCount/OutCount’.</p>
  <p>Example: ‘2/1’ meaning there have been 2 CHECK INs but only 1 CHECK Out.</p>
  <p>6. A blank value of the in/Out Count Field will be treated as ’0/0’ so there is no need to initialize this field.</p>
  <p>7. Whenever SAMPro sends a CHECK IN, it will increment the Work Order’s inCount; whenever SAMPro sends a CHECK OUT, it will increment the Work Order’s outCount.</p>
  <p>8. Whenever SAMPro sends either a CHECK IN or a CHECK OUT, it will use the value of the Work Order’s inCount for the ID value, ignoring the outCount. Thus a CHECK IN can have multiple CHECK OUTs. Note that because of this, the outCount is actually irrelevant in this processing and is maintained only for informational purposes.</p>
  <p style="margin-left: 48px; font-weight: bold;">Caution:<br/>
    <span style="font-weight: normal;">This feature should only be used for customers </span>not<span style="font-weight: normal;"> using ServiceChannel’s IVR check-in/check-out system. It is not clear at this time what will happen if, for example, a Check-Out is sent to ServiceChannel as a response to SAMPro processing a Check-Out message sent by ServiceChannel itself.</span>
  </p>
  <h3>20.1.10 Registry to Derive Scheduled Date / Time of Accepted Request Message from Original ServiceChannel Request</h3>
  <p>When New Call creates a new Workorder based on a  Service Request from ServiceChannel (via the Weblog), it must send ServiceChannel a message that the Service Request has been accepted. This message includes a Scheduled Date and a Scheduled Time.</p>
  <p>Normally the Scheduled Date and Scheduled Time are derived from the Workorder being created. The following registry may be implemented to derive the Scheduled Date and Scheduled Time are from data in the original Service Request that was sent by ServiceChannel. </p>
  <p><span style="font-weight: bold;">Id:</span> sys-fmms-vendor-servicechannel</p>
  <p><span style="font-weight: bold;">Setting Key:</span> SchedDateTimeSourceWhenAcceptingWO</p>
  <p><span style="font-weight: bold;">Setting Value:</span> ServiceRequest or WorkOrder (default)</p>
  <p>If the key is missing or the value is other than &#39;ServiceRequest&#39; (case insensitive), a value of &#39;WorkOrder&#39; will be assumed.</p>
  <p>If the Setting Value is &#39;ServiceRequest&#39;, then the Scheduled Date and Scheduled Time will be taken from the original Service Request issued by ServiceChannel. If the value is &#39;WorkOrder&#39;, the Scheduled Date and Scheduled Time will be taken from the Workorder being created.</p>
  <h3>20.1.11 Map SAMPro Log Status to ServiceChannel by Client Id</h3>
  <p>This release adds the flexibility to map SAMPro log status’ to Service Channel log status’ based on registry set values keyed by Client Id (derived from the Job in the WO header).</p>
  <p>Normally, SAMPro Workorder status codes are mapped to ServiceChannel status codes via the ‘StatusMappings’ lines found in the SAMPro ServiceChannel Registry entry; they will be used for all Service Channel Clients. However, various ServiceChannel clients may have differing status code mappings. This release extends the SAMPro Registry to allow multiple status mapping sets based on the Workorder&#39;s Client Id (derived from the Job in the WO header).</p>
  <p>To create a set of Status Mappings in the SAMPro sys-fmms-vendor-ServiceChannel Registry for a specific Client, append a &#39;-&#39; and the Client Id to the &#39;StatusMappings&#39; key.</p>
  <p style="text-decoration: underline; ">Example:</p>
  <p><span style="font-weight: bold;">Id:</span> sys-fmms-vendor-ServiceChannel</p>
  <p><span style="font-weight: bold;">Setting Key:</span>  StatusMappings-Wendys   </p>
  <p><span style="font-weight: bold;">Setting Value:</span> Acknowledged:DISPATCH CONFIRMED</p>
  <p style="margin-left: 48px;"><span style="font-weight: bold;">Tip:</span><br/>
    Make sure that a StatusMappings option without the Client Id appended is retained for general use.</p>
  <h3>20.1.12  Registry to Delay ServiceChannel Upload of Work Performed</h3>
  <p>An earlier release supported the sending of &#39;Equipment Work Performed&#39; notes to ServiceChannel on Work Order Status changes. This could be an issue because TechAnywhere may not upload the equipment information to SAMPro for some minutes after the Status Change is uploaded.<br style="color: #000000; 
	 font-family: Verdana, &#39;Helvetica Neue&#39;, Helvetica, Arial, sans-serif; 
	 font-size: 14px; font-style: normal; font-variant-ligatures: normal;

	 orphans: 2; text-align: start; text-indent: 0px; text-transform: none; 
	 white-space: normal; widows: 2; word-spacing: 0px; -webkit-text-stroke-width: 0px; 
	 text-decoration-style: initial; text-decoration-color: initial;"/>
    <br style="margin-bottom: 0px; color: #000000; font-family: Verdana, &#39;Helvetica Neue&#39;, Helvetica, Arial, sans-serif; 
	 font-size: 14px; font-style: normal; font-variant-ligatures: normal; 
	 font-variant-caps: normal; font-weight: 400; letter-spacing: normal;

	 white-space: normal; widows: 2; word-spacing: 0px; -webkit-text-stroke-width: 0px; 
	 text-decoration-style: initial; text-decoration-color: initial;"/>
    This release supports a Registry-specified delay between the posting of the Status change and the sending of the Equipment Work Performed notes. The assumption is that by providing a sufficient delay, TechAnywhere will have uploaded the required Equipment information before the delay expires.
  </p>
  <p><span style="font-weight: bold;">Id:</span> sys-fmms-vendor-ServiceChannel</p>
  <p><span style="font-weight: bold;">Setting Key:</span> EquipmentWorkPerformedDelaySeconds  <span style="font-weight: bold;">Setting Value:</span> <span style="font-style: italic;">delay in seconds</span></p>
  <p><span style="text-decoration: underline; ">Example:</span> The following will delay the sending of the Equipment Work Performed message for 30 minutes following the status change. The default delay is zero seconds.</p>
  <p>Setting Key: EquipmentWorkPerformedDelaySeconds  Setting Value: 1800</p>
  <h3>20.1.13 Registry to Support Canadian Sales Tax Invoicing</h3>
  <p style="margin-left: 8px;">This release supports a registry to enable enhanced processing to support sales tax for Canadian Service Channel invoicing. The GST will be reported in the &#39;invoiceTax&#39; column while other taxes are to be reported in the &#39;tax2&#39; and &#39;tax2Name&#39; columns. The Sales Tax Authority&#39;s &#39;Tax Code From State&#39; field is used to identify the appropriate tax category to be reported for an invoiced tax amount. This should contain one of the following values: &#39;GST&#39;, &#39;PST&#39;, &#39;HST&#39;, or &#39;QST&#39;.</p>
  <p style="margin-left: 8px;">The following Service Channel Registry entry is required to turn on Canadian Tax reporting</p>
  <p style="font-weight: bold; margin-left: 8px;">Id: <span style="font-weight: normal;">sys-fmms-vendor-ServiceChannel</span></p>
  <p style="margin-left: 8px;"><span style="font-weight: bold;">Setting Key:</span>  InvoiceIsCanadian  <span style="font-weight: bold;">Setting Value:</span> yes (or begins with  &#39;y&#39;, &#39;Y&#39;, &#39;t&#39;, &#39;or T&#39;)</p>
  <p style="margin-left: 8px;">Note that the Tax Authority Tax Code From State field has been relaxed to allow values that are longer than 2 characters.</p>
  <h2>20.2 Service Channel / New Call</h2>
  <p>Previously, when a Service Request generated a Weblog in SAMPro the Client Site was not completed. This release has been enhanced to try to identify the proper Site and, if found, use it in the Weblog.</p>
  <p>The Work Order&#39;s NTE is now set correctly when it is created from a ServiceChannel Service Request (Weblog) processed in New Call.</p>
  <p>This release modifies the computation of DATETIME so that it can not be earlier than SCHED_DATETIME to conform with recent ServiceChannel validations.</p>
  <h3>20.2.1 FMMS - New Call Web Log</h3>
  <p>This release adds a new pick list option when selecting a web log from New Call. If FMMS is enabled, the user is prompted to &quot;Show Special FMMS Only List?&quot;. Clicking No will pull up the usual list (with FMMS and other weblogs). Clicking Yes will pull up the new list, which is tailored for clients using FMMS. It displays the following information:</p>
  <p style="font-weight: bold; margin-left: 48px;">Web Log ID - Web Log Date - FMMS Vendor - Site ID if known - FMMS Site/Location - FMMS Request</p>
  <h2>20.3 Service Channel / Work Order Documents</h2>
  <p>The ServiceChannel document upload now uses the document from the Archive File Location in preference to the File Location. This change was made because the Archive File Location is more form stable and accessible to the function since the File Location might be a different user&#39;s PC.</p>
  <p style="margin-left: 8px;"><img alt="" border="0" src="assets/images/image/ServiceChannel_Upld_new.gif" style="border: none;"/></p>
  <p><span style="font-weight: bold;">New Button: ServiceChannel Upload</span><br/>
    A new &#39;ServiceChannel Upload&#39; button will appear on the Document Viewer&#39;s list and record screens if the Work Order is integrated with ServiceChannel. Pressing this button from the Document list will give a checklist of all attachments to allow the user to select multiple attachments to send at once. Pressing from the Document record will upload that single attachment. The attachment(s) will be emailed to ServiceChannel where they will be processed at a set interval and attached to the ServiceChannel system.</p>
  <h2>20.4. Service Channel / Work Orders</h2>
  <p>The COMPL_DATETIME will be sent to ServiceChannel for status change messages beginning with &#39;COMPLETED&#39;. COMPL_DATETIME is derived from the scheduled date and time on the Work Order&#39;s Technicians tab.</p>
  <h2>20.5 Reverse Posted Invoices (ServiceChannel)</h2>
  <p>When ServiceChannel work order are billed, the invoice is automatically uploaded to ServiceChannel. In previous releases, if the invoice was reversed and re-invoiced, the only way to handle this was to manually press the Submit button in the invoice master.</p>
  <p>This release supports the automatic resending of the re-invoiced invoice. Specifically, when an Invoice Master is marked as &#39;Reversed&#39;, any FMMSInfo records meeting the following requirements are located:</p>
  <p style="margin-left: 48px;">The FMMSInfo record&#39;s wrkordr_rn field matches the reversed Invoice Master&#39;s srvceinvce_wrkordr_rn field.</p>
  <p style="margin-left: 48px;">The FMMSInfo record has it&#39;s fmmsinfo_invce_qd column set to &quot;Y&quot;.</p>
  <p style="margin-left: 48px;">IF any such FMMSInfo records are found, their fmmsinfo_invce_qd column is reset to &#39;N&#39;.</p>
  <h2>20.6 Check In/Out Problem: TR_NUM vs. WO_NUM</h2>
  <p>This release addresses a situation where ServiceChannel sends SAMPro a CHECK IN (or CHECK OUT) message in which the TR_NUM points to an FMMSInfo record for a Work Order different from that indicated by the CHECK message&#39;s WO_NUM value. In this release, if the CHECK message contains conflicting TR_NUM and WO_NUM values:</p>
  <p style="margin-left: 48px;">An entry will be made in the FMMS log file</p>
  <p style="margin-left: 48px;">But a Work Order will not be updated because since we do not know which one is correct</p>
  <h2>20.7 Service Channel Invoices</h2>
  <p>See Customer Note 20.1.13 for a registry to enable Canadian Sales Tax on invoices.</p>
  <p>This release expands the support of optional detail lines on Service Channel Invoice I.14 to Other Labor lines.  </p>
  <p style="margin-left: 8px;">The Service Channel i.14 invoice template requires that materials are used to complete the job; ServiceChannel will reject the invoice if it doesn&#39;t contain material information. Since all jobs do not require materials, this release will add a dummy $0 material line to get around this requirement. The Material Description of &#39;No Material Required&#39; will be used on the $0 line to conform to ServiceChannel requirements.</p>
  <p style="margin-left: 8px;">ServiceChannel invoice spreadsheets generated by SAMPro can contain multiple invoices. In previous releases, contained a blank line separating the invoices. In this release, the blank line has been eliminated for  both the i12 and i14 invoices.</p>
  <p style="margin-left: 8px;">This release corrects issues experienced by some Canadian users uploading invoices. The Invoice Date is now sent in US format even for Canadian users for the I12 and I14 ServiceChannel Invoice Formats.</p>
  <h2>20.8  FMMS Document Maintenance</h2>
  <h3>Start FMMS Prune Folders</h3>
  <p>It may be necessary to run Start Function List update to add this new function to User Group All. It may then be added to the appropriate administrative User Group if needed.</p>
  <h3>Purpose:</h3>
  <p>The FMMS process can leave a lot of files in the following folders:</p>
  <p>InboundDocumentArchiveFolder<br/>
    InboundDocumentRejectFolder<br/>
    InboundMessageDumpFolder</p>
  <p>This release provides a mechanism for automatically pruning these folders of the older, expendable files.</p>
  <h3>SAMPro Registry Entries</h3>
  <p>This process is controlled by the FMMS Vendor’s configuration stored in the SAMPro Registry (e.g. Registry Id: ‘sys-fmms-vendor-servicechannel’). The appropriate line keys are:</p>
  <p><span style="font-weight: bold;">Setting Key:</span> PruneArchiveRetentionDays  <span style="font-weight: bold;">Setting Value:</span> <span style="font-style: italic;">numberofdays</span></p>
  <p>Only files older that this number of days are candidates for removal. No files will be removed if this entry is absent.</p>
  <p><span style="font-weight: bold;">Setting Key:</span> PruneArchiveMaxCount   <span style="font-weight: bold;">Setting Value:</span> <span style="font-style: italic;">numberoffiles</span></p>
  <p>No more than this number of files will be removed each time the ‘Prune Folders’ function (as described below) is invoked. No such limit will be imposed if this entry is absent.</p>
  <p style="margin-left: 48px; text-decoration: underline; ">Example: if PruneArchiveRetentionDays = 90 and PruneArchiveMaxCount = 100,</p>
  <p style="margin-left: 48px;">• Only files older than 90 days old will be removed.</p>
  <p style="margin-left: 48px;">• No more than the 100 oldest files will be removed at a time.</p>
  <p style="margin-left: 48px; text-decoration: underline; ">Example: if PruneArchiveRetentionDays = 90 and PruneArchiveMaxCount is absent from the Registry,</p>
  <p style="margin-left: 48px;">• All files older than 90 days old will be removed.</p>
  <h3>Implementation Instructions</h3>
  <p>1. Create the appropriate SAMPro Registry entries for the FMMS vendor whose archives are to be pruned (e.g. in the ‘sys-fmms-vendor-servicechannel’ entry).</p>
  <p>2. Create a Scheduled Event to periodically run the above function.</p>
  <h1>21  DBAnalytics / KPI&#39;s</h1>
  <p>In 9.1.611.060 and up, this update disallows users from attempting to utilize a SAMPro viewer from DBAnalytics during an executing process. When a user attempts to utilize a process when it is currently functioning, an alert will display “This function cannot be used while the function is executing.”</p>
  <p>In 9.1.611.059AVAd and up, this update disallows users from attempting to utilize a SAMPro viewer from DBAnalytics during an executing process. When a user attempts to utilize a process when it is currently functioning, an alert will display “This function cannot be used while the function is executing.”</p>
  <p><span style="font-weight: bold;">KPI Definition Import (KPI Import button and Start KPI Definition function):</span> Corrects a problem in recent releases where importing large object KPI&#39;s did not actually update the KPI definition column. </p>
  <p style="margin-left: 8px;"><span style="font-weight: bold;">DBAnalytics Document Posting</span> supports the UseSubdirectories option in sys-document-archive. This enhancement will alleviate performance issues caused by having too many files in the root archive folder.</p>
  <p style="margin-left: 8px;">Exporting / Importing a User&#39;s dashboard profiles now works correctly with List type Analytics.</p>
  <h2>21.1 Function Table</h2>
  <p>A new Column, fnctn_prmry_tble, has been added to the Function Table to identify the Primary Table for each Viewer.  This field was added to assist in the writing of KPI&#39;s and other reporting functions.  </p>
  <h2>21.2 Registries</h2>
  <h3>21.2.1 Custom PM WorkBench</h3>
  <p>Certain Custom PM Workbench analytics depend on knowing which of a job&#39;s Cost Codes is designated as the &#39;Fee Code&#39;. This analytic uses the following registry to determine which of the Cost Code User fields is being used (typically the User4 field).</p>
  <p><span style="font-weight: bold;">Id:</span> sys-viewer-vjbprgrss</p>
  <p><span style="font-weight: bold;">Setting Key:</span> LumpSumUsrFldNmbr   <span style="font-weight: bold;">Setting Value:</span> 4   (1,2 or 3 are also permitted)</p>
  <p>In this case, the Job Cost User User4 field should be set to Y if it is designated as the &#39;Fee Code&#39; record or N if it is not.</p>
  <h3>21.2.2 Registry Option to Specify A WebServer Port Range</h3>
  <p>Each user session must occupy exclusive control over a LocalHost IP: Port to maintain a token based WebService session between DB Analytics and SAMPro to enable launching SAMPro viewers by extension from DB Analytics.</p>
  <p>In previous releases, the regimen was to deploy and maintain dedicated port number assignment via User Registry and/or DB Registry settings which works well enough for FAT-Client situations. This configuration got cumbersome and tedious when Terminal Services enters the picture and as a result the feature wasn&#39;t exploited and utilized to the degree it might otherwise have been.</p>
  <p>In this releases, the web session start code has been revised to alternatively assess currently occupied &quot;ports&quot; that fall within a Registry-defined &quot;Port Range&quot; so that an available port conforming to the range can be dynamically assigned.</p>
  <p>Id: sys-dashboard</p>
  <p>Setting Key: WebServerPortRange   Setting Value: <span style="font-style: italic;">firstport</span>:<span style="font-style: italic;">lastport</span></p>
  <p style="margin-left: 48px; text-decoration: underline; ">Example:</p>
  <p style="margin-left: 48px;">Setting Key: WebServerPortRange   Setting Value: 50000:51000</p>
  <p><span style="font-weight: bold;">Note:</span> the old setting is WebServerPort; it will still be used if the newer WebServerPortRange is not implemented.</p>
  <p>In version 9.1.611.059 and up, the web session start code has been revised to make an assessment of currently occupied &quot;ports&quot; that fall within a Registry-defined &quot;Port Range&quot; so that an available port conforming to the range can be dynamically assigned.</p>
  <h3>21.2.3 Launch DBAnalytics with the User&#39;s Default Browser</h3>
  <p><span style="font-weight: bold;">Id:</span> sys-dashboard</p>
  <p>The registry option DefaultBrowser is now obsolete; DBAnalytics will always be launched with the user&#39;s default browser. This option is also obsolete when entered in the User&#39;s Registry tab.</p>
  <h3>21.2.4 Open Quote Manager instead of Quote Master</h3>
  <p>Before when a user would open the SAMPro quote viewer, it would go to the old Quote Master Viewer. Now the SAMPro quote viewer will open the updated Quote Manager Viewer. </p>
  <p><strong>Id:</strong> FieldFormViewer.openViewerFromDBAnalytics </p>
  <p><strong>Setting Key:</strong> @Drilldown@</p>
  <p><strong>Setting Value:</strong> name=View Quote; description=; value=View Quote Manager; title=; type=SAMPro; column=QuoteId; hidden=true</p>
  <h2>21.3 Progress Billing Analytics</h2>
  <h3>21.3.1 Overview</h3>
  <p>This Analytic allows the Project Manager (PM) to participate in the billing preparation process without using SAMPro. An IIS web server is required for this Analytic.</p>
  <p class="Support" style="margin-left: 8px;"><img alt="" border="0" height="164" src="assets/images/Progress Billing Invoices Editor.png" style="border: none;" width="644"/></p>
  <p>PMs may review and &#39;approve&#39; a Job for billing and then pass it on to the Billing Department in the back office for completion.  The Billing Department then uses the Record Billing Adjustments function to finish the invoice preparation, printing and posting.  This process is summarized in the following diagram.</p>
  <p class="Support" style="margin-left: 48px; font-weight: normal;"> </p>
  <p class="Support" style="margin-left: 8px;"><img alt="" border="1" src="assets/images/BillingAnalyticFC.jpg" style="border-style: solid; border-width: 1px;"/></p>
  <p>Special database fields record the PM&#39;s initial approval and any adjustments that should be made Validation controls who may update a Job (the PM using the analytic or the back office billing department).<br/>
    <br/>
    1. The analytic does not allow the PM to make ANY billing changes when the Job&#39;s Invoice Status has a value of &quot;Ready&quot; or &quot;Printed&quot;.  When the Job reaches this state, the PM should communicate any additional billing changes to back-office personnel who can make the appropriate adjustments.  A message to that effect should be given to the PM once additional changes have been disabled.<br/>
    <br/>
    2.  If the Job passes the previous test, the new PM Next Invoice Status must be checked before allowing billing changes.  If its value is set to &quot;Imported&quot;, advise the PM with an appropriate warning message.  A value of &quot;Imported&quot; means back-office personnel have already started processing the job&#39;s next invoice.
  </p>
  <p>3.  When the previous tests are passed, the PM can use the new analytic to its full potential. These changes will be made to the new Job Billing Item fields noted below.</p>
  <p>4. Back-office processing in Record Billing Adjustments will not accept any values in the new Billing Item fields until the Job&#39;s PM Next Invoice Status has a value of &quot;Submitted&quot;.  That means the PM can make (and save) preliminary billing changes that don&#39;t go into effect until the PM indicates (via the analytic) that all changes have been made and the job is ready for invoicing. At that point, the analytic should set the value to &quot;Submitted&quot;.</p>
  <h3><span style="font-weight: bold;">21.3.2 Job Billing Item - New Fields</span></h3>
  <p>Several new fields have been added to the Job Billing Item which may be set by PM&#39;s in the new Billing Analytic. They will then be used by Record Billing Adjustments to pass values these values to the Job Billing Item fields used for progress invoicing in SAMPro.</p>

  <p><span style="font-weight: bold;">New Field - PM Next Invoice Status</span><br/>
    This display field is used in conjunction with certain Progress Billing Invoice / Project Manager Workbench DBAnalytics. This new field is used in conjunction with the Job&#39;s pre-existing Invoice Status field that already controls the back-office invoicing process.</p>
  <p>This field has four potential values:</p>
  <p style="margin-left: 48px;">The default value is &#39;Unknown&#39;.  This is the value assigned to a new Job. When a Progress Billed Job is posted, the PM Next Invoice Status will be set back to Unknown so that it will be eligible for additional updates in the Billing Analytic.  </p>
  <p style="margin-left: 48px;">&#39;PM Review&#39; indicates the PM has started making changes using the Billing Invoices analytic.  In this state, the changes have not been submitted for use by the back office billing processes.</p>
  <p style="margin-left: 48px;">&#39;Submitted&#39; indicates the PM has finished preparing for the next invoice and the back office billing processes can begin.  Setting the status to &#39;Submitted&#39; can only be achieved by the PM using the Billing Invoices analytic. The Status will be changed to Submitted when PM indicates he/she is finished with all necessary. The PM is not allowed to make changes the Status has the value of either Submitted or Imported.</p>
  <p style="margin-left: 48px;">&#39;Imported&#39; indicates the back office processing has begun.  Specifically, the PM&#39;s designated billing values have been imported into the Billing Items via the Record Billing Adjustments function.  This takes the place of having back office personnel manually enter the PM&#39;s billing values.</p>
  <h3>21.3.4 Record Billing Adjustments - Initial Screen</h3>
  <p style="margin-left: 48px;"><span style="font-weight: bold;">Changed Field: Job Id</span><br/>
    Validation now prevents Jobs with the PM Next Invoice Status set to &#39;PM Review&#39; from being selected in Record Billing Adjustments. Jobs with the PM Next Invoice Statuses of &#39;Submitted&#39;, &#39;Unknown&#39; and &#39;Imported&#39; (if the Job&#39;s Invoice Status is correctly set) are allowed.</p>
  <p style="margin-left: 48px;">The Next PM Invoice Status will be changed from Submitted to Imported when the PM&#39;s designated billing values have been imported and the changes saved in Record Billing Adjustments.  </p>
  <p style="margin-left: 48px;"><span style="font-weight: bold;">New Field:</span> <span style="font-weight: bold;">PM Next Invoice Status</span><br/>
    This display field is used in conjunction with certain Progress Billing Invoice / Project Manager Workbench DBAnalytics. This new field is used in conjunction with the Job&#39;s pre-existing Invoice Status field that already controls the back-office invoicing process.</p>
  <p style="margin-left: 48px;">Validation now prevents Jobs with the PM Next Invoice Status set to &#39;PM Review&#39; from being selected in Record Billing Adjustments. Jobs with the PM Next Invoice Statuses of &#39;Submitted&#39;, &#39;Unknown&#39; and &#39;Imported&#39; (if the Job&#39;s Invoice Status is correctly set) are allowed. The Next PM Invoice Status will be changed from Submitted to Imported when the PM&#39;s designated billing values have been imported and the changes saved in Record Billing Adjustments.  </p>
  <h3>21.3.5 Job Invoice Post</h3>
  <p style="margin-left: 8px;">When a Progress Billed Job is posted, the PM Next Invoice Status will be set back to Unknown so that it will be eligible for additional updates in the Billing Analytic.  </p>
  <h2>21.4 Start Dashboard Post</h2>
  <p>Documents uploaded from the web products (DBAnalytics, FMAnywhere, CRM, Dispatch Board) that use the &#39;Start Dashboard Post&#39; or &#39;Start NetFramework Post&#39; functions, now have their appropriate web viewable flags set.<span style="font-weight: bold;"> </span></p>
  <p style="margin-left: 8px; font-weight: bold;"><span style="font-weight: normal;">When a DBAnalytics user (without a Contact / Email record) requests that an email be sent to them, the error is ignored to avoid crashing the Scheduled Event Manager. The actual problem will be handled in a future DBAnalytics release.</span>  </p>
  <h3>21.4.1 Quote Scope Documents</h3>
  <p style="margin-left: 8px; font-weight: bold;"><span style="font-weight: normal;">Version 9.1.611.057 corrects an existing issue in CRM where Quote scopes were unable to display. This has been preventing Quote Scope documents from being able to be attached to the scope they are associated with. This change also supports other double-keyed records such as the Job Billing Item.</span></p>
  <h2>21.5 Start DBAnalytics</h2>
  <p style="margin-left: 8px; font-weight: normal;">The user&#39;s default browser is now launched when opening DBAnalytics from SAMPro.</p>
  <h2>21.6 Alert </h2>
  <h3>21.6.1 Alert When Opening Viewer from DBAnalytics</h3>
  <p>In previous releases, when two accounts were working on the same Work Order, saving would result in an error alert for another WO number. In version 9.1.611.059 and up, when two users are editing the same WO without saving changes, an alert prompts users to save work for the WO being edited. </p>
  <h1>22 SubAnywhere</h1>
  <h2>22.0 Overview</h2>
  <h3>22.0.1 What is SubAnywhere?</h3>
  <p>SubAnywhere is a web-enabled module which allows your Subcontractors to</p>
  <p style="margin-left: 48px;">Accept or decline your work assignments</p>
  <p style="margin-left: 48px;">Review the Work Requested and other pertinent Work Order information</p>
  <p style="margin-left: 48px;">Update the Work Order&#39;s Status</p>
  <p style="margin-left: 48px;">Add negotiated charges to the Purchase Order associated with the Work Order</p>
  <p style="margin-left: 48px;">Set up records for their own Techs: a special mobile web version of SubAnywhere allows these Techs to access Work Order information and make status updates</p>
  <p style="margin-left: 48px;">Submit Quotes for additional work</p>
  <p style="margin-left: 48px;">Update and download documents (such as PDF&#39;s and photos)</p>
  <p style="margin-left: 8px;">SubAnywhere includes easy-to-understand Help available from each of its pages. In addition, you may contact your support rep or access the User Forum for a PowerPoint presentation on using and setting up SubAnywhere.</p>
  <h3>22.0.2 Setting Up SubAnywhere</h3>
  <p style="margin-left: 8px;">Your support representative will set up the basic framework of SubAnywhere, but the following records may need to be updated in SAMPro:</p>
  <p style="margin-left: 48px;">Technician Record:</p>
  <p style="margin-left: 88px;">Main Tab:  Vendor Id is specified</p>
  <p style="margin-left: 88px;">Web Access Tab: Web Access = Subcontractor, Device = SubAnywhere</p>
  <p style="margin-left: 48px;">Vendor Record:</p>
  <p style="margin-left: 88px;">Defaults Tab: verify that the Rate Schedule Id is properly completed. SubAnywhere only allows the Other Rates on the selected Schedule to be entered.  </p>
  <p style="margin-left: 48px;">Rate Schedules  for Vendors:</p>
  <p style="margin-left: 88px;">Only the Other Rate column needs to be completed.  The Other Rate Table defines which Other Rates your Subs will be allowed to choose in SubAnywhere from their drop-down charges list.</p>
  <p style="margin-left: 48px;">Other Rate Tables for Vendors:</p>
  <p style="margin-left: 88px;">If you have negotiated rates, the Rate column should be completed with the price the Sub will charge your company; SubAnywhere users will NOT be able override the price or description when they enter this charge. If the Rate column is empty,  the SubAnywhere user can enter price and unique description.</p>
  <p style="margin-left: 48px;">Site Equipment:</p>
  <p style="margin-left: 88px;">Main Tab: An override to the Vendor’s Rate Schedules may be specified in the Equipment record&#39;s Service Provider / Rate Schedule field.  For example, special higher negotiated rates might exist for equipment located in Manhattan. In this case, this override would be use to generate the Charges drop down list in SubAnywhere for this equipment.</p>
  <p style="margin-left: 48px;">Escalation Profiles:</p>
  <p style="margin-left: 88px;">Please discuss with your support rep.</p>
  <p style="margin-left: 48px;">Registry for Documents Uploads / Download</p>
  <p style="margin-left: 48px;">Scheduled Event for Document Upload / Download</p>
  <p style="margin-left: 88px;">Your support rep should set these up with consultation from your IT department.</p>
  <p style="margin-left: 8px;">A PowerPoint with additional detail is available.</p>
  <h2>22.1 Recent SubAnywhere Updates</h2>
  <p style="margin-left: 8px;">SubAnywhere Document Posting supports the UseSubdirectories option in sys-document-archive. This enhancement will alleviate performance issues caused by having too many files in the root archive folder.</p>
  <h2>22.1.1  New Remote Device Type: SubAnywhere</h2>
  <h5>Technician Viewer Web Access Tab</h5>
  <p style="font-weight: bold;">Remote Device Type<br/>
    New Option: SubAnywhere</p>
  <p>If SubAnywhere IS enabled, set the Remote Device Type to SubAnywhere. This field controls whether PO’s are created as Released (None) or Unreleased (SubAnywhere).  If a particular subcontractor should not have access to SubAnywhere, set the Remote Device Type to None. The Web Access field should be set to Subcontractor if you want to auto-generate PO’s for them when a Work Order is created in New Call or Create PM WorkOrders; this is true whether or not SubAnywhere is enabled.</p>
  <h5>New Call</h5>
  <p style="margin-left: 8px;">When a Work Order is created for a SubAnywhere subcontractor tech in New Call or via Create PM Work Orders, the PO that is simultaneously created will be set to Unreleased to conform to SubAnywhere requirements. To be considered a SubAnywhere tech, the Technician record must: reference a Vendor record; have the Web Access field set to Subcontractor, and have the Remote Device Type set to the new option of SubAnywhere.</p>
  <h5>Work Order Create Sub PO</h5>
  <p>When SubAnywhere subcontractor is added to a Work Order, the PO that is generated for the sub (either automatically or by clicking the Create Sub PO button) will be set to Unreleased to conform to SubAnywhere requirements. To be considered a SubAnywhere tech, the Technician record must: reference a Vendor record; have the Web Access field set to Subcontractor, and have the Remote Device Type set to the new option of SubAnywhere.</p>
  <h3>22.1.2 <span style="font-weight: bold;">Create PM WOs for SubAnywhere Techs</span></h3>
  <p>When a PO is generated for a SubAnywhere Tech, the initial PO status is now set to Released if it will include GEN lines. This prevents SubAnywhere users from adding charges to PO&#39;s that already have a cost associated with it from the Equipment&#39;s PM Schedule&#39;s Contract Cost. The SubAnywhere PO will be set to Unreleased if it does not include a GEN line.  The PO&#39;s Release Date will not be completed if the PO is Unreleased.</p>
  <p>In earlier releases, the Status for a SubAnywhere PO was set to Unreleased regardless of whether or not it included GEN lines.</p>
  <h2>22.2 Registry</h2>
  <h3>22.2.1 Registry Start NetFramework Post</h3>
  <p>The Start NetFramework Post function provides a SubAnywhere Scheduled Event Manager for Document Uploads. Specifically, it handles messages for SAMNetFramework applications such as SubAnywhere. Currently, this function supports handling Document Uploads in a fashion similar to DashboardEventManager and Start Dashboard Post.  This function should be implemented by adding the Start NetFramework Post to a scheduled event to be run at an interval of your choosing. The following registry is required.</p>
  <p><span style="font-weight: bold;">Registry Id:</span> sys-netframework</p>
  <p><span style="font-weight: bold;">Setting Key:</span> UploadFolder  <span style="font-weight: bold;">Setting Value:</span> <span style="font-style: italic;">Absolute file path</span></p>
  <p>The UploadFolder setting is the default location where files from SAMNetFramework applications (e.g., SubAnywhere) are uploaded.  This setting can be overridden by the registry of specific SAMNetFramework applications (note: for Sntfrmewrkpst to properly retrieve the file from the overridden location, &quot;Application&quot; must be specified in Message record contents).</p>
  <h2>22.3 Work Order SubQuote Tab</h2>
  <p style="margin-left: 8px;">This tab will be updated from the new SubAnywhere module&#39;s Quotes tab.</p>
  <p style="margin-left: 8px;">Costing and other information (but not pricing) will be imported from this tab by the Quote Scope&#39;s Import Sub Quote wizard.</p>
  <p>
    <font style="font-weight: bold;">Quantity</font><br/>
    The number of this item/charge being quoted.
  </p>
  <p>
    <font style="font-weight: bold;">Other Rate Id:</font><br/>
    The Other Rate being quoted.  
  </p>
  <p><span style="font-weight: bold;">Tech Id:</span><br/>
    The Subcontractor quoting this work</p>
  <p>
    <font style="font-weight: bold;">Unit Cost:   Extended Cost:</font><br/>
    The Cost of the item/item being quoted. This is the price the Subcontractor is charging for the work. These fields will be defaulted from SubAnywhere.  Manual entries to this tab do not default the cost.
  </p>
  <p style="font-weight: bold;">Unit Price:  Extended Price:<br/>
    <span style="font-weight: normal;">These fields will be ignored by the Quote Scope&#39;s Import Sub Quote wizard; the markup rules defined in the Scope (Rate Schedule, Markup % or Gross Margin %) will be applied to the imported costs to determine the Scope&#39;s revenues.</span>
  </p>
  <p>
    <font style="font-weight: bold;">Description:  Other Rate Description:</font><br/>
    The Description field must be completed in order for this line to be imported into a Quote Scope; this field will default from SubAnywhere.  The display-only Other Rate Description appears for informational purposes.
  </p>
  <p style="margin-left: 8px;"><span style="font-weight: bold;">Equipment Id:</span><br/>
    This field must be completed in order for this line to be imported into a Quote Scope.</p>
  <h2>22.4 Quotes: Importing from the Work Order SubQuote Tab</h2>
  <p>This functionality is available on the Quote Scope&#39;s Main tab and Quotemaster&#39;s Scope Tab.</p>
  <p><img alt="" border="0" src="assets/images/ImportSubCost.bmp" style="border: none;"/>  New Button:</p>
  <p>This functionality is designed for use with SubAnywhere. When clicked a wizard will be launched to import costing information from the SubQuote tab of the WO referenced in the Quote Manager/Master header. When the costs are imported, the markup rules defined in the Scope (Rate Schedule, Markup % or Gross Margin %) are applied to the imported costs to determine the Scope&#39;s revenues. This will be done even if Revenue has been entered on the Work Order&#39;s SubQuote tab.</p>
  <p style="margin-left: 48px;">Note: Wizard Requirements<br/>
    If no lines from the WO SubQuote Tab match the Equip. Id on the Scope, a message stating “No Sub Quote lines found to import matching the Equipment Id on the Scope” will appear.</p>
  <p style="margin-left: 48px;">If the WO Id is not completed in the Quote Manager, the following message will be displayed:  “No Sub Quote lines found to import matching the Work Order Id on the Quote”.</p>
  <h1>23 Client Order Processing (COP)</h1>
  <h2>23.1 COP Registries</h2>
  <h3>23.1.1 Specify AR Control Account for COP Invoice</h3>
  <p> If more than a single AR Control GL Account exists in your database, will not be automatically filled in when Report COP Invoice is run.  This registry allows the user to default in the correct AR Control GL Account for COP Invoices.</p>
  <p style="margin-left: 48px;"><span style="font-weight: bold;">Id:</span>  sys-viewer-clntordr</p>
  <p style="margin-left: 48px;"><span style="font-weight: bold;">Setting Key:</span> ARControlAccount   <span style="font-weight: bold;">Setting Value:</span> <span style="font-style: italic;">a valid AR Control GL Account Id</span></p>
  <h3>23.1.2 Registry to Set GL Entity when Releasing Recurring Client Orders</h3>
  <p>This release corrects an issue where the GL Entity was not defaulting properly from the Recurring Client Order when Start Release Recurring Client Orders was run, leaving users unable to process the resulting Client Order.</p>
  <p>By default the GL Entity first pulls from the Location record (Client site second, and Inventory Group third). If intercompany is enabled, the GL Entity will always pull from the Location because the GL Entity is required in the Location record for intercompany databases.</p>
  <p>Because of the above, Recurring Client Orders (and Start Release Recurring Client Orders) will now look to the following existing registry for defaulting the GL Entity:</p>
  <p><span style="font-weight: bold;">Registry Id:</span>  sys-viewer-vclntordr</p>
  <p><span style="font-weight: bold;">Setting Key:</span> GLEntityScheme  <span style="font-weight: bold;">Setting Value:</span> <span style="font-style: italic;">value</span></p>
  <p>where value is replaced by one of the following:</p>
  <p style="margin-left: 48px;"><span style="font-weight: bold;">clntste</span> (the GL Entity will be taken from the Client Site referenced by the order; (this pulls the GL Entity into the child lines on the Inventory tab of COP Order &amp; sets the parent COP tab’s GL Entity)</p>
  <p style="margin-left: 48px;"><span style="font-weight: bold;">lctn</span> (the COP order will pull the GL Entity from the Location ID and put this on the Main parent tab of the COP Order AND create each Inventory line with the GL Entity from the Location record. It will ignore the info setup on the Client Sites COP tab.</p>
  <p style="margin-left: 48px;"><span style="font-weight: bold;">invntrygrp</span> (the GL Entity will be taken from the Inventory Group referenced by the Inventory Item on the order line. This setting ONLY changes/impacts the GL Entity of Inventory lines on the COP order (does not alter any info on the main Parent tab).</p>
  <p>*Note - The GL Entity on the expanded child view of the Recurring Client Order will remain blank, but the Client Order generated from the starter function will properly pull the GL Entity from the parent of the Recurring Client Order.</p>
  <h3>23.1.3 Registry to Specify COP Quotation Footer Override</h3>
  <p>The hard-coded footer text (including quote stated in US $, 30 day valid, and quoted by Customer Service Manager) has been removed from the standard COP Quotation report. The following registry (see Customer Note 23.1.3) or a bitmap/jpg may be used to provide footer information as needed.</p>
  <p style="margin-left: 8px;"><span style="font-weight: bold;">Registry Id:</span> sys-report-rordrqttn</p>
  <p style="margin-left: 8px;"><span style="font-weight: bold;">Setting Key:</span> ReplacementFooter  <span style="font-weight: bold;">Setting Value:</span> true</p>
  <p style="margin-left: 8px;"><span style="font-weight: bold;">Setting Key:</span> line1   <span style="font-weight: bold;">Setting Value:</span> <span style="font-style: italic;">Text for line 1 of footer</span></p>
  <p style="margin-left: 8px;"><span style="font-weight: bold;">Setting Key:</span> line2   <span style="font-weight: bold;">Setting Value:</span> <span style="font-style: italic;">Text for line 2 of footer</span></p>
  <p style="margin-left: 8px;"><span style="font-weight: bold;">Setting Key:</span> line3   <span style="font-weight: bold;">Setting Value:</span> <span style="font-style: italic;">Text fo line 3 of footer</span></p>
  <h3>23.1.4 Registry to Auto Email COP Invoice when printed &amp; posted</h3>
  <p>New functionality and registry options were added to allow users to auto-email COP Invoices using the Client&#39;s email address when the user confirms the Invoice print &amp; post. On Portrait style COP Invoices, the Client&#39;s email address will be printed at the bottom. When a single invoice is run directly from the COP Order, the &quot;Send To&quot; address will now be pre-populated with the Client&#39;s email address. This feature is not available when run in batch mode. </p>
  <p><strong>Note: The side Email button should NOT be used when run in BATCH mode as it will attach a PDF file that contains multiple invoices (for different clients).</strong></p>
  <p><strong>Registry Id:</strong> sys-report-rcopinvce</p>
  <p><strong>Enable Auto-Emailing the COP Invoice:</strong></p>
  <p><strong>Setting Key:</strong> autoEmail                      <strong>Setting Value: </strong>false <br/>
    <strong>Setting Key: </strong>autoemailwhenprinted   <strong>Setting Value:</strong> true<br/>
    <strong>Setting Key:</strong> emailbysection              <strong>Setting Value:</strong> true<br/>
    <strong>Setting Key:</strong> skipEmailNoAddress     <strong>Setting Value: </strong>Y (default N)
  </p>
  <p><br/>
    <strong>Side Email Button on the Reports Screen:</strong>
  </p>
  <p><strong></strong>These options can be implemented if the user wishes to either block or use the side Email button after responding to the question ‘Did this report print successfully’ confirmation box. </p>
  <p><strong>Setting Key:</strong> OkToEmail    <strong>Setting Value:</strong> false (default is true)</p>
  <p>This setting will permanently disable the Side Email button; an invoice cannot be emailed from the report screen&#39;s Email button.</p>
  <p><strong>Setting Key:</strong> OkToEmailWithoutPrint     <strong>Setting Value:</strong> false (default is true) </p>
  <p>If this option is set to false, the Email button will be disabled (grayed-out) when the report is first displayed. The button will be enabled only when the invoice has been printed and posted.</p>
  <p><strong>Note: This option would need to be disabled to Re-Print &amp; email COP Invoices.</strong></p>
  <h3>23.1.5 Report to Allow Email &quot;To&quot; Features to Work When Using Outlook Registry Setting</h3>
  <p>When the below registry is set to true, the Email Address &quot;TO:&quot; populates with the Default the Client Site&#39;s Email Address into Outlook. </p>
  <p><strong>Id:</strong> &#39;sys-email’</p>
  <p><strong>Setting Key:</strong> UseOutlook    <strong>Setting Value:</strong> true</p>
  <h2>23.2 COP Reports</h2>
  <h3>23.2.1 COP Invoices</h3>
  <p style="margin-left: 8px;">Previously, all COP invoices added $.01 to the base price in Avalara and then returned the overstated base price back to the Tax History in SAMPro. This update corrects this defect.</p>
  <p style="margin-left: 8px;">This release corrects a spurious Runtime error that appeared when launching Report COP Invoice in a database which contained only a single AR Control GL Account,</p>
  <p style="margin-left: 8px;">The Invoice Master&#39;s Branch is set from the Client Order&#39;s Branch when the COP Invoice is generated.  </p>
  <p style="margin-left: 8px;">AR Terms on COP invoice included a line for a discount. In version 9.1.611.059 and up, the wording is now optional and available but removed until added. </p>
  <p style="margin-left: 8px;">The updated customized v.cus now includes the PBBS page header for the COP Quote Report. </p>
  <p style="margin-left: 8px;">This is a customized report includes an updated v.cus file that encompasses the ability for a bitmap on the COP Quote form and adds the ability (via registry) to specify a Job Cost Code to be used to override the Work Order Default Job Cost Code when TechAnywhere posts inventory line items to the WO Inventory child tab.</p>
  <h3>23.2.2 COP Quotation</h3>
  <p style="margin-left: 8px;">The hard-coded footer text (including quote stated in US $, 30 day valid, and quoted by Customer Service Manager) has been removed from the standard COP Quotation report. See Customer Note 23.1.3 for a registry to specify customer footer text.</p>
  <h2>23.3 Client Order Intercompany Processing</h2>
  <p>This release corrects an issue with filling B/O&#39;s and completing Client Orders in intercompany configurations.</p>
  <p>When using Intercompany processing, the GL Entity and Company are now defaulted when the Print Invoice button is pressed from View Client Order.</p>
  <p>In order to support Intercompany Processing, Client Orders &amp; COP Invoices now post with the proper Security and Company Security information. This ensures that the COP Orders carry the correct security/company information when the COP Invoices are posted to the AR Sales Journal and carried over into the various history tables (arhstry, glhstry, txhstry, imhstry, invcemstr, etc).  In addition, the Start Fill Backorders function now works properly for Client Orders generated in this release when InterCompany is enabled.</p>
  <p>If the COP module is set up to default the information from the Client Site’s COP tab instead of the Location (where sys-viewer-vclntordr GLEntityScheme=clntste registry option exists), the system will now use the Client Site’s COP tab&#39;s GL Entity for posting the invoices Freight, Dropship Freight and make sure that the COGS posting for dropships uses the same GL Entity for both the debit &amp; credit side of the AR Sales GL journal entry.</p>
  <h2>23.4 Client Order</h2>
  <p>In the 9.1.611.062c release, this update rewrites the Last Time Sold Tab in the Client Order to account for data that was previously not displaying. Additionally a &quot;Site ID&quot; column has been added to allow for it to automatically filter to the Client Site. Users may remove this filter to view all sites for the Client.</p>
  <p>Previously, the Record Pick Ticket on an order with a Lot Controlled Item with a previously Invoiced order, the following error appears: The Serial/Lot Number: [Serial/Lot Number] is Already Being Shipping On Order [Order Number]”  This error appeared even if the quantity on hand is available in the Lot selected. This update corrects this defect.</p>
  <p>This update makes the Client Order parts history site-specific, rather than client. This update adds the Client Site ID as a new column to the data present on the tab, filtering to the site that has been selected. A user may remove this filter if they choose to view it filtered by Client.</p>
  <p>This update adds an error message if a user makes edits to the &quot;Shipped&quot;,&quot;ToBckOrd&quot;, or &quot;ToShort&quot; when a Pick Ticket has been flagged as &quot;PICK DONE&quot;. The warning message displays:<br/>
    &quot;Edits to quantities already recorded PICK DONE could have adverse effects to IMH&quot;</p>
  <p>Previously, when a user in the Project Manager Workbench clicked the &#39;Create Quote&#39; button on the left-side pan, it would direct the user to Quote Master instead of the Quote Manager. This update corrects this defect. <br/>
    <strong>Note: Contact support if you want to launch the deprecated Quote Master instead.</strong>
  </p>
  <p>This update adds Client Site ID and Client Site Alpha columns between Client Id and PO Number in the Recurring Orders &quot;ByClientByAlphaID.”</p>
  <p>This update adds additional filters for &quot;Client Site&quot; and &quot;Entered By&quot; for the COP order viewer.</p>
  <p>This update adds a column on the COP Order Acknowledgement report for the Inventory Item&#39;s Unit of Measure provided it is present on the Inventory Item record. This is added to the right of the Quantity Column with a header of &quot;UOM.”</p>
  <p>This update adds the Site&#39;s &quot;PO Required?&quot; checkbox field to the Client Order viewer as a display-only field. If the Site used in the Client Order viewer has the &quot;PO Required?&quot; checkbox checked, then the PO Number field on the Client Order viewer must be filled in.</p>
  <p>The Billing Comment box is now added to the Client Order Data page to provide information to New Call via SAMPro. Previously, there was not a billing comment box for the Client Order Data page.<br/>
    Version 9.1.611.056 corrects a display issue where the Contract Id &#39;disappeared&#39; when this field was set and the record saved. The Contact Id is now displayed correctly.</p>
  <p>This release enhances validation to prevent the user from adding duplicate Inventory Id lines on a Client Order.</p>
  <h3>23.4.1 COP Pick List</h3>
  <p>Previously when a Serialized Item is sold via COP and then returned to stock via a Credit Memo, that Serial Number(s) could not be resold. Because users could not produce an Invoice and Bill the Client for these items that were returned to stock and resold, this triggered an error. In 9.1.611.062c and up, this update corrects this defect and returned items can now be resold.</p>

  <h1>25 DBSellpoint Point of Sale</h1>
  <h2>25.1 Overview</h2>
  <p><span style="unicode-bidi: embed; mso-line-break-override: none; word-break: normal; 
		 punctuation-wrap: hanging;">DBSellPoint is a point of sales app developed to handle over the counter and retail sales transactions for SAMPro. Payments can be made with cash or credit card, or on account for existing customers. The app is designed to be run on an A</span>ndroid tablet with a credit card scanner, barcode scanner, and a cash drawer,</p>
  <p>Returns of DBSellPoint sales are also supported in the app. A PowerPoint presentation focusing using the app itself is available.</p>
  <h2>25.2 New Function - Start Point of Sale Scheduled Event Manager</h2>
  <p>This function posts messages (transactions entered in the DBSellPoint app) to the SAMPro database. It is responsible for generating the needed AR Sales Journal, Invoice Master, Inventory History, Job History and Cash Receipts in SAMPro. It handles both DBSellPoint Sales and Returns.</p>
  <p>This function will be configured to run automatically by support when it is installed.</p>
  <h2>25.3 Setting Up SAMPro for DBSellpoint</h2>
  <p style="font-weight: bold;"><span><span style="font-weight: bold;">GL Entities are derived as follows:</span></span></p>
  <p style="margin-left: 48px;">ENTB = Balance Sheet Entity (from Company)</p>
  <p style="margin-left: 48px;">ENTI = Income Statement Entity (from Site COP tab)</p>
  <p style="margin-left: 8px; font-weight: bold;">Posting of POS sales should use the Entity defined above as follows in posting:</p>
  <p style="margin-left: 48px;">1) Cash Receipts Records</p>
  <p style="margin-left: 88px;">a. GL Entity – use Company ENTB – arrcpts.glentty.rn</p>
  <p style="margin-left: 48px;">2)  AR Sales Records</p>
  <p style="margin-left: 88px;">a.AR Control Entity – use Company ENTB – arsls.glentty.rn</p>
  <p style="margin-left: 88px;">b. Entities for GL Posting</p>
  <p style="margin-left: 128px;">i.All Sales Lines, Entity = Site COP ENTI<br/>
    ii.All Expense (cost) Lines, Entity = Site COP ENTI<br/>
    iii.Accounts Receivable, Entity = Company ENTB<br/>
    iv.All Sales Tax Lines, Entity = Company ENTB<br/>
    v.All Inventory, Entity = Company ENTB</p>
  <h3>25.3.1  RAQ: Default Cash / Client Site: Walk Up Customer</h3>
  <p>A default customer (Client Site) must be set up for walk up cash/credit customers where the sale will not be for  &#39;on account&#39; or cash sales to an existing customer. The RAQ configDefaultCustomer (site RN)  defines the default customer (site) that comes up on POS initial screen. This record will be configured by support when your system is set up.</p>
  <h3><span style="font-weight: bold;">25.3.2 Payment Type: GL Bank Account for Cash Receipts Entry</span></h3>
  <p>When an AR Cash Receipts entry is posted from DBSellpoint, the GL Bank Account will default from the Payment Type selected on the POS screen.</p>
  <p style="margin-left: 8px;"><span style="font-weight: normal;">When Invoices are posted from DBSellpoint, the Invoice&#39;s Due Date, Discount Date, Discount Available are now set based on its AR Terms.</span></p>
  <h3>25.3.3 Returns Processing</h3>
  <p style="margin-left: 48px;"><span style="font-weight: bold;">NOTE:</span> If a dollar limit for cash reimbursements is exceeded, a return will require submitting paperwork to accounting and a check gets cut to the customer at some future date.  In that scenario, SAMPro provides no automated help in managing the debt or producing the payment.  Accounting must create a Vendor record and the appropriate AP Journal entry so the customer eventually gets paid/reimbursed as a &#39;vendor&#39;.</p>
  <p style="margin-left: 8px;">Returns are defined by messages including the key &#39;Return=true&#39;?  If the customer is reimbursed (cash, credit card credit, etc), the DBSellpoint app will also provide that information so the appropriate negative Cash Receipt can be generated.</p>
  <p style="margin-left: 8px;">The posting depends on whether or not the customer was reimbursed at the POS counter.</p>
  <p style="margin-left: 48px;">If the customer is reimbursed:</p>
  <p style="margin-left: 88px;">The return is treated as a Credit Memo and posts the appropriate Sales and Cash Receipts transactions.</p>
  <p style="margin-left: 88px;">In the Sales Journal, the Invoice Id will be generated by appending the letters CM will to the original POS Invoice Id (e.g.,143234CM). The Transaction Description will be set to &#39;POS Return Entry&#39;.</p>
  <p style="margin-left: 88px;">The Cash Receipts entry will be made with negative receipts and a Transaction Description will be set to &#39;POS Return Entry&#39;.</p>
  <p style="margin-left: 48px;">If not reimbursed:</p>
  <p style="margin-left: 48px;">Only a Sales Journal entry will be made using the Costs tab of the Sales Journal to effectively put the Return &#39;On Account&#39; for the customer.  The Client specified in the Sales Journal will be derived from the Client listed on the Site&#39;s COP tab.</p>
  <p style="margin-left: 8px;">A Restocking Fee may be assessed in the DBSellpoint return which will reduce the amount of the return. The RestockGLAccount registry detailed in Customer Note 25.4.3 may be used to specify the GL Account restocking fees will post to. If this <span style="text-indent: -.25in; 
													 mso-list: l0 level1 lfo1;">registry is absent the Sales GL Account will be used.</span></p>
  <p style="margin-left: 8px;">If the registry is not set, the return amount for each line will be the original sales less the restocking fee.  If the registry is enabled then the difference on each line between the original sales and return amount will be posted to the Restock Account.</p>
  <h2>25.4 Registry Settings</h2>
  <h3>25.4.1 User Registry Tab: Default Location/Tax Group for DBSellpoint</h3>

  <h2>27.2 Setting up the Start EDI Scanner</h2>
  <p style="mso-list: l0 level1 lfo1;">The function Start EDI Scanner (Sscedi) will be used to poll the Upload Folder for the unprocessed Xml files from the Marketplace app. It may be necessary to run  Start Function List Update to and the new Start EDI Scanner function.  It should be added to the User Group for the special &#39;agent&#39; user that will be running this function. A Scheduled Event should be set to run Start EDI Scanner every 60 seconds.</p>
  <h2>27.3 MarketPlace/SAMPro Integration Overview</h2>
  <p style="mso-list: l0 level1 lfo1;"><b style="mso-bidi-font-weight: normal;">T</b>he purpose of this integration is to reduce the effort and increase the accuracy of creating purchase orders and quotes in SAMPro. The PO’s requirements originate in the third-party Marketplace application. The integration includes several <span style="background-color:#000044;color:#ffffff;">custom mod</span>ifications to SAMPro including:</p>
  <p style="mso-list: l0 level1 lfo1; margin-left: 48px;">1. The automatic creation of Purchase Orders via a supplied .xml file.</p>
  <p style="mso-list: l0 level1 lfo1; margin-left: 48px;"><span style="text-indent: -.25in; 
	 mso-list: l0 level1 lfo1;">2. The creation of a Purchase Order .xml file used for delivery to the vendor by the Marketplace app.</span></p>
  <p style="mso-list: l0 level1 lfo1; margin-left: 48px;">3. Receive Order Acknowledgements that update the existing Purchase Order.</p>
  <p style="mso-list: l0 level1 lfo1; margin-left: 48px;">4. Import Quote Scope details to an existing Quote via a supplied .xml file.</p>
  <p style="mso-list: l0 level1 lfo1; margin-left: 48px;">5. Automatic creation/update of Inventory Part records via a supplied .xml file.</p>
  <p style="mso-list: l0 level1 lfo1; margin-left: 48px;">6. Import Automated Ship Notifications (ASN) to the Receiving Journal in SAMPro.</p>
  <p style="mso-list: l0 level1 lfo1;">Each of these is detailed below.</p>
  <p style="mso-list: l0 level1 lfo1; mso-bidi-font-weight: normal;"><b>1 and 2. Create PO from Marketplace App / Generate PO .xml file Delivered to Vendor by Marketplace App (1 &amp; 2 above)</b></p>
  <p style="mso-list: l0 level1 lfo1;">When a user using the Marketplace app determines that parts need to be ordered to fulfill the needs of a repair work order it will create a Purchase Order .xml file (see below) and store it in a pre-defined (Inbound)) folder on the local database. Note that only one vendor can be specified in the PO .xml file (one PO per file). <span style="mso-spacerun: yes;"> </span></p>
  <p style="mso-list: l0 level1 lfo1;">When it runs, the Start EDI Scanner function will poll the Inbound folder for unprocessed .xml files. When found, the system will first execute the create/update inventory part function (defined below) and then it will create a Purchase Order in the SAMPro database from the .xml file. Once the .xml file is processed it will be moved to a “processed” file folder (defined by the InboundAcceptedFolder registry option) and the log file updated.</p>
  <p style="mso-list: l0 level1 lfo1;">Once the PO is created the system will create the 855 PO.xml file, this time with the newly created PO number inserted into the file and place it in a pre-defined folder (as specified by the InboundAccepted option)<span style="font-weight: bold;"> </span>for pick up by the Marketplace app which will then deliver the PO to the designated vendor.</p>
  <p style="mso-list: l0 level1 lfo1; mso-bidi-font-weight: normal;"><b>3. Receive Order Acknowledgements that update the existing Purchase Order</b></p>
  <p style="mso-list: l0 level1 lfo1;">The Marketplace app will receive Order Acknowledgments (OA) from the vendor and provide a mechanism for users to accept/reject the OA. If accepted, the Marketplace app will create a revised 855 PO.xml file containing all the original and revised data accepted via the Marketplace app and store it in a pre-defined folder on the local database. <span style="mso-spacerun: yes;"> </span>When it runs, Start EDI Scanner will poll the Inbound folder for unprocessed .xml files. When found, the system will first execute the create/update inventory part function (defined below) and then it will update the referenced Purchase Order in the SAMPro database from the .xml file. Once the .xml file is processed it will be moved to a “processed” file folder (defined by InboundAcceptedFolder) and the log file updated.</p>
  <p style="mso-list: l0 level1 lfo1; mso-bidi-font-weight: normal;"><b>4. The ability to import Quote Scope details to an existing Quote</b></p>
  <p style="mso-list: l0 level1 lfo1;">When a user using the Marketplace app determines that a repair needs to be quoted the app will create a Quote Scope .xml file and store it in &quot;inbound&quot; folder (defined via the InboundFolder registry) on the local database. The user will then create a Quote referencing the diagnostic Work Order Id and then create a new Quote Scope. From the Quote Scope viewer the user will press a new icon labeled “Import Scope”. The system will look in the Quote Scope folder location for .xml files that reference the Work Order Id specified in the Quote header record. <span style="mso-spacerun: yes;"> </span><i style="mso-bidi-font-style: normal;">The Quote .xml file may contain multiple options</i> (qtescpe_id’s) so a selection list needs to be displayed allowing the user to choose which qtescpe_id they want to import. After selecting the system will first execute the create/update inventory part function (defined below) and then the details specified in the (Quote).xml file will import into the Quote Scope viewer. Once the .xml file is processed it will be moved to a “processed” file folder (defined by the InboundAcceptedFolder registry) and the log file updated.</p>
  <p style="mso-list: l0 level1 lfo1; mso-bidi-font-weight: normal;"><b>5. Automatic creation/update of Inventory Part records</b></p>
  <p style="mso-list: l0 level1 lfo1;">When a new part is sourced by the Marketplace app and the details for the part either need to be added or updated in the SAMPro parts database, the Marketplace app will create an .xml file and store it an &quot;inbound&quot; folder (defined via the InboundFolder registry) on the local database. Every time the automatic PO creation or Quote Scope import functions are executed, SAMPro will first execute an import/update inventory function that looks for unprocessed inventory .xml files in the folder and either creates or updates inventory part records in the SAMPro database. Once the .xml file is processed it will be moved to a “processed” file folder (defined by InboundAcceptedFolder) and the log file updated.</p>
  <p style="mso-list: l0 level1 lfo1; mso-bidi-font-weight: normal;"><b>6. Import Automated Ship Notifications (ASN) to the Receiving Journal in SAMPro</b></p>
  <p style="mso-list: l0 level1 lfo1;">The Marketplace app will deliver 856 ASN .xml files to a pre-defined folder on the local database. On a daily basis, SAMPro users should open the Inventory Receipts Journal and specify a PO Id; this will execute a function that looks for unprocessed ASM .xml files and creates a selection list for the user to select from. The user will select a PO/ASN that has physically been received in the warehouse and it will then import into the Inventory Receipts Journal.</p>

  <h5>Inventory</h5>
  <p style="margin-left:33px"><strong>IRJ viewer:</strong> Previously, the unit price for inventory items marked as “Use Price Levels with valid Unit Prices” were being changed to cost times markup/multiplier/margin when received for a Purchase Order using the Inventory receipt journal, which had a direct work order attachment. When the inventory receipt journal was used to receive the items from the PO, the job rate schedule pricing method was used to calculate the unit price (revenue) for the work order when the item’s unit pricing should be used.This only affected builds 9.1.611.057a to 9.1.611.061d. This update corrects this defect. </p>
  <h2>9.1.611.062 (2023-01-12)</h2>
  <h5>Service Management</h5>
  <p style="margin-left:33px"><strong>Work Order viewer:</strong> Previously, when the focus was on the Labor Tab line #1, it lost field value and was updated to 0. That update carried through to the JCH posting effectively eliminating hours that were posted from a Labor Journal Transaction. This update corrects this defect.</p>
  <h2>9.1.611.062 (2023-01-11)</h2>
  <h5>Accounts Receivable</h5>
  <p style="margin-left:33px"><strong>OpenEdge:</strong> Previously, the UserID column in Open Edge did not populate in reports due to OpenEdge integration no longer supporting their &#39;User Defined&#39; fields through their new APIs.<br/>
    The following updates have been added to the following fields:</p>
  <p style="margin-left:43px">User ID: Provides SAMPro or TechAnywhere User ID depending on if it is created via SAMPro or TechAnywhere<br/>
    Invoice Number: Provides invoice numbers for TechAnywhere, cash receipts for single and multiple invoice, and Create PM Billing Adjustments.</p>
  <h5>Inventory </h5>
  <p style="margin-left:33px"><strong>COP Pick List Entry viewer:</strong> This update adds the following popup warning for when a quantity picked is greater than the on-hand quantity to COP Pick Tickets: &quot;Warning: The quantity picked is greater than the quantity ordered. Press OK to continue.&quot;<br/>
    For lot-controlled inventory items, if the quantity picked is greater than the quantity available in the specified lot number, a pop-up warning appears: &quot;The quantity picked exceeds the quantity available in the specified lot number. Press OK to continue.&quot;</p>
  <h5>System </h5>
  <p style="margin-left:33px"><strong>Expiration Warning Message: </strong>This update suppresses the pop-up of the software expiration warning message for the SAMPro services. Previously the pop-up expiration warning caused problems with the automatic startup of services via AlwaysUp. This is due to the lack of a human to acknowledge the warning message and the services could not start automatically within 15 days of software expiration.</p>
  <h2>9.1.611.062 (2023-01-04)</h2>
  <h5>Avalara</h5>
  <p style="margin-left:33px"><strong>Avalara: </strong>This update ensures the Invoice Master Viewer’s invoice reversal process does not allow “locked” Avalara documents to get reversed.  Invoice reversal process includes the WO Viewer Invoices tab, various AR and GL reports, the Avalara web portal, etc. Avalara invoice reversal process now does the following: <br/>
    When the status is COMMITTED, VOIDED, or LOCKED, the restrictions noted below apply unless the user is running a special session.  <br/>
    Special sessions include (a) running in development mode; (b) logging in with one of the Master Passwords; or (c) running as a user with an Account Type of Special.<br/>
    When the status is COMMITTED or LOCKED, these restrictions apply:<br/>
    1.    Record cannot be deleted.<br/>
    2.    Child lines cannot be deleted.<br/>
    3.    Child lines cannot be inserted.<br/>
    Field changes are denied except for parent Description, Due Date, child Description.<br/>
    When the status is VOIDED, all record changes and deletions are denied.</p>
  <h5>Client Order Processing</h5>
  <p style="margin-left:33px"><strong>Client Order viewer: </strong>This update makes the Client Order parts history site-specific, rather than client. This update adds the Client Site ID as a new column to the data present on the tab, filtering to the site that has been selected. A user may remove this filter if they choose to view it filtered by Client.</p>
  <h5>Inventory</h5>
  <p style="margin-left:33px"><strong>Physical Count viewer:</strong> Previously when processing a Physical Count, if the quantity for a Lot Controlled Item needed adjusting (up or down), the system would throw a message that the Quantity for Serialized Inventory cannot be greater than 1 and would not let the user continue or leave the field or Save the record. User would have to refresh the viewer and then lose all other quantity adjustments entered.  Now the Physical Count viewer allows for the adjustment of Lot Controlled quantities. </p>
  <h5>Job/ Job Costing</h5>
  <p style="margin-left:33px"><strong>Job Cost Allocations:</strong> Previously the Job Cost Allocation function was not properly joining the job cost history to security. This caused any summed totals to be incorrect for any customer using security, due to reading the values multiple times. This update joins records from job cost history to security using their security RNs. In addition to removing the duplicated values in the calculations, this will also ensure that the data is filtered to the user&#39;s security.<br/>

  <h5>Purchasing</h5>
  <p style="margin-left:33px"><strong>Purchase Order viewer:</strong> Previously when creating Purchase Orders for sales taxable jobs, utilizing the inventory tab, random inventory parts get coded as tax type = &quot;prepaid.” This registry corrects if a value is entered in the inventory item ID, execute the same logic that executes if the user enters the quantity first. </p>

  <h5>Project Management / Job Costing</h5>
  <p style="margin-left:33px"><strong>Project Manager Workbench viewer:</strong> Previously when implementing the Project Manager WorkBench, the Process Project Manager routine was no longer performed, so a clean starting point was re-established. This update corrects this defect. </p>
  <h2>9.1.611.062 (2022-12-14)</h2>
  <h5>Job/Job Costing</h5>
  <p style="margin-left:33px"><strong>Job Cost EOM: </strong>Previously, the Jobcost End Of Month postings in JC History were preventing the release of qualifying Accounts Payable invoices for the  Start Pay-When-Paid Approved List function. To allow eligible AP invoices to qualify for release using the Start PWP Approved List function, this update includes a string to ignore/exclude those postings in JCH derived from source ‘Jobcost EOM’.</p>
  <h5>Service Management </h5>
  <p style="margin-left:33px"><strong>Taylor UWO:</strong> This update adds the option of Travel (“T”) as a Unit of Measurement to the Other Rate IDs used on the Work Order Other tab. This is a customized for Taylor Universal Work Order.</p>

  <h5>System</h5>
  <p style="margin-left:33px"><strong>Viewers (general record cloning):</strong> This update corrects a defect with the code when a specific user would clone an employee, a technician, or a client site record, entering a new Id and clicking “Add” would not copy fields, as it did for other users. In addition, a previous defect from a previous case where unintended issues in the Approval Wizard as well as the Service Channel integration impacted all viewers. This update corrects this defect to only impact Cloning records.</p>
  <h2>9.1.611.062 (2022-11-09)</h2>
  <h5>Invoicing</h5>
  <p style="margin-left:33px"><strong>Create PM Billing:</strong> Previously during the Create PM Billing process, when a Credit Card alias would be declined, the system stopped and threw a message/error at every entry that declined. When this happened, users would have to select OK on two separate messages. This causes a halt when users were mass batches were processed. Now the error messages are suppressed from displaying as a window as they error, and a document is produced at the end of the batch with a list of failures, their IDs, and the error message so they can be addressed.</p>
  <h5>Purchasing</h5>
  <p style="margin-left:33px"><strong>Inventory Receipts Journal viewer:</strong> Previously, the markup price on both the Inventory and General tabs for purchased items was calculated on cost without Use tax when the Income Receipts Journal is used to receive items. If the items are received directly on the Purchase Order, the markup is correctly calculated on cost with use tax. This update corrects this defect. </p>
  <h5>Service Management</h5>
  <p style="margin-left:33px"><strong>Work Order viewer:</strong> Previously, when the focus was on the Labor Tab line #1, it lost field value and updated to 0.

This update corrects this defect. Now, the logic is changed to account for when the Payment Alias, used in combination with a Master Contract and Site, is not the Payment Alias on the Site&#39;s Master Contract child line. </p>
  <h2>9.1.611.062 (2022-10-27)</h2>
  <h5>Accounts Receivable</h5>
  <p style="margin-left:33px"><strong>Avalara (COP):</strong> Previously, all COP invoices added $.01 to the base price in Avalara and then returned the overstated base price back to the Tax History in SAMPro. This update corrects this defect.</p>
  <h5>Inventory </h5>
  <p style="margin-left:33px"><strong>User Group viewer Inventory:</strong> Previously in the User Groups record, when filtering to a smaller subset of items and then saving, only the “yes” for the items in the filtered list would save and everything outside of that reverted from “yes” to “no.” This update corrects this defect. </p>
  <h5>Invoicing</h5>
  <p style="margin-left:33px"><strong>Service Invoice Processing:</strong> This registry gives the option to enable/disable the auto-email behavior as relates to $0.00 Invoices based on the Work Order type associated with the invoice. When this registry is enabled, $0.00 invoices associated with performing Preventative Maintenance visits will be produced and delivered to serve as PM Work Order receipts.<br/>
    Note: Contact your Support representative for a vital report for this registry.</p>
  <h5>Payroll</h5>
  <p style="margin-left:33px"><strong>Compute PR: </strong>Previously in versions 9.1.611.057 and prior, SAMPro rounded the non-annualized taxes up by a penny. Versions 9.1.611.058 and up are no longer rounding the non-annualized taxes up by a penny. This update now rounds the taxes up by a penny.</p>
  <h2>9.1.611.062 (2022-10-20)</h2>
  <h5>Avalara</h5>
  <p style="margin-left:33px"><strong>Avalara:</strong> Previously when invoicing a job for the first time (where sales tax group ID is truly blank) SAMPro called out to Avalara and wrote back an appropriate tax group and invoices.  However, those initial invoices would not display on the Sales Tax Summary by State by Group Report (RSLSTXSMMRY-TXHSTRY). This update corrects this defect and the report displays the invoices.<br/>
     </p>
  <h5>Job/ Job Cost</h5>
  <p style="margin-left:33px"><strong>Job Cloning: </strong>When cloning a Job to be linked to an inactive client or site, a warning box now alerts users about the inactive client or site. The warning box says “The {Client/ Site} you have selected has a status of {inactive, credit hold, mail list}. Do you want to continue with the Job cloning process?&quot; with a Yes and No button, allowing the user to continue or back out of the clone.</p>

Now, the logic is changed to account for when the Payment Alias, used in combination with a Master Contract and Site, is not the Payment Alias on the Site&#39;s Master Contract child line. </p>
  <h5>Invoicing</h5>
  <p style="margin-left:33px"><strong>Progress Invoicing: </strong>Previously when the retainage was calculated by Record Billing Adjustments after a Posted Invoice has been Reversed, they did not add up the to correct billing on line 8. This update corrects how retainage gets recalculated by Record Billing Adjustments after a Posted Invoice has been Reversed.</p>
  <h5>Job/ Job Cost</h5>
  <p style="margin-left:33px"><strong>Job Billing Item Id:</strong> Since the Billing Item ID was updated to 15 characters, the display in SAMPro shows only 10 characters and it does not allow the user to click on the field to see the full details by navigating to the end of the field. This updates the layout in read-only fields and updates this value for the Record Billing Adjustment fields.</p>
  <h2>9.1.611.062 (2022-09-28)</h2>
  <h5>Accounts Payable</h5>
  <p style="margin-left:33px"><strong>EFT-AP Processing:</strong> This update changes the batch code for a specific client who needed a different batch code in Line 8.</p>

  <p style="margin-left:33px"><strong>OpenEdge:</strong> Previously, when Open Edge used USAePay to negative credit card charge (credit) was sent to the processor, the processor was posting it as a positive charge against the credit card account.

  <h2>9.1.611.062 (2022-09-27)</h2>
  <h5>Accounts Receivable</h5>
  <p style="margin-left:33px"><strong>Credit Card Processing: </strong>Previously, when a client in New Call cleared or blanked out the payment alias, it cleared the information from the screen. When the New Call was added, it cleared out the Client Site Payment Alias field in the client site record but left the data in the Client Site Masked Credit Card Number, Client Site Credit Card Expiration Date, Client Site Masked Credit Card Transaction Id fields. This update corrects this defect and adds a warning popup message that says: &quot;Warning: You are about to delete Credit Card payment information from the record.&quot; </p>
  <h5>GL / Bank Journals</h5>
  <p style="margin-left:33px"><strong>Bank Reconciliation Journal viewer</strong>: Previously, the AutoFillChecksDefaultCleared registry determined whether to override the date comparison and simply always set the new line to not be &quot;cleared.&quot; An exception was made to ONLY apply to existing reconciliation transactions (save mode). The setting did not apply when adding a new reconciliation record (add mode).  This update corrects this behavior to allow it to match behavior when adding.</p>
  <h5>Purchasing</h5>
  <p style="margin-left:33px"><strong>Workers Comp Processing:</strong> SAMPro now defaults into the Labor Journal the correct Workers Comp category from the security that matches the employee&#39;s security for the following tabs: Employee Rate Test, Labor Journal, WO Labor Tab, and import from Labor Journal into WO, based on the Job Cost Category &quot;Workers Comp&quot; tab and the Workers Comp&#39;s State from the Job.</p>
  <h5>Service Management</h5>
  <p style="margin-left:33px"><strong>New Call viewer:</strong>  Previously in New Call, when creating a Work Order from an FMMS Web Log, the selection window appeared with no relevant Tracking Number from Service Channel. Now the selection window includes the tracking ID and is placed to the right of the &quot;ServiceChannel&quot;.</p>
  <p style="margin-left:33px"><strong>Work Order Viewer:</strong> When a user had the Gross Margin tab open and made changes to the Labor, Inventory, or Other tabs and then saved, the Gross Margin tab did not display the changes made. When a user clicked save a second time or went to another tab on the top and back to the Gross Margin tab, it would display the updated Gross Margin tab. This update corrects this defect and the changes to the Gross Margin tab saves the first time.</p>
  <h5>System</h5>
  <p style="margin-left:33px"><strong>Viewers (general): </strong>Previously, the SAMPro session run by customers using the AlwaysUp service would not fully close down because it gets hung up on the message box &quot;Are you sure you want to exit?&quot; AlwaysUp did not know what to do, so it waits and then ultimately has to forcibly end the task, leaving an orphaned active lgnhstry entry, and other issues like timeout alarms not being canceled. This update eliminates the &quot;Are you sure you want to exit?&quot; message box for certain users so that SAMPro just exits when the exit button is pressed.</p>
  <h5>TechAnywhere</h5>
  <p style="margin-left:33px"><strong>TechAnywhere:</strong> Previously, Work Order Attachments from TechAnywhere were not posting with security since receiving the 9.1.611.054 update. This update corrects this defect. </p>

  <p style="margin-left: 33px;"><strong>Work Order viewer:</strong> Previously when editing the Flat Rate Labor Unit Cost, the updated cost would not appear updated on a new work order without closing the work order viewer first.

  <h5>Service Management </h5>
  <p style="margin-left:33px"><strong>Scheduled Event Manager:</strong> This update corrects a defect where sending emails with headers and logos caused errors when triggered by web log. This was caused by one of the following:<br/>
    -The current code assumed that Escalation is triggered by a Work Order and therefore the Escalation Profile could be determined by joining to the Work Order table using the Scheduled Event Source Id.<br/>
    -The Escalation is triggered by a Web Log.</p>
  <p style="margin-left:33px"><strong>Scheduled Report Manager:</strong> Previously, if no repeat time was specified, scheduled reports would trigger in an infinite loop triggering every minute. To prevent this, an error message pops up to the user preventing them to leave without adding a specified time when the Repeat Event box is checked.<br/>
    Also, to ensure that the user has input a time when repeating, &quot;Repeat Options&quot; on the scheduled report viewer is now added to the same section in the scheduled event viewer for reports.<br/>
    In addition, this update prevents users from attempting to make edits that should be done via navigating to the report and then scheduling the report.</p>
  <h5>System </h5>
  <p style="margin-left:33px"><strong>Report Emailing:</strong> This update corrects a defect where the spacing and other formatting changes made the email content look warped. This only happened when common phrases were referenced in the email. <strong></strong></p>

  <h5>Service Management</h5>
  <p style="margin-left:33px"><strong>New Call viewer:</strong> Previously when filtering the equipment, the requested equipment was being filtered out of the list due to the user’s service category filtering when it should not have been. This issue was due to a timing error noticeable in a specific customization. Now, the service category filtering occurs after the equipment has loaded. This update will be included for all customers.</p>
  <p style="margin-left:33px"><strong>Work Order viewer:</strong> Previously, when a user had a Gross Margin tab open and made changes to the Labor, Inventory, or Other tabs and save, the Gross Margin tab did not display the changes made. This update corrects this defect. </p>

  <p style="margin-left:33px"><strong>Cash Receipts Journal viewer:</strong> Previously, when processing a credit card payment and a user closed out of the AR Cash Receipts screen or exited SAMPro before the process was complete, returning and completing the process would result in two transactions for the client and one transaction in SAMPro. This update prevents the viewer from closing while the payment is processing and removes the Cancel button from the progress bar.</p>
  <p style="margin-left:33px"><strong>Cash Receipts Journal viewer: </strong>Previously when processing a negative payment and using a payment alias, a text window would appear indicating that &quot;an error occurred&quot; even though the response was Approved.

  <h5>Service Management</h5>
  <p style="margin-left:33px"><strong></strong><strong>New Call viewer: </strong>This update provides a minor performance update to TechAnywhere message processing for web logs.</p>
  <h5>System</h5>
  <p style="margin-left:33px"><strong>Scheduled Reports Processing</strong>: Previously, when scheduling the DGLHSTRY report and including single quotes in the text in the range field, it would result in an error. The DGLHSTRY reports can run correctly when single quotes are used in the range fields. This update corrects this defect. </p>
  <p style="margin-left:33px"><strong>Viewers (general):</strong> Previously when loading SQL results into memory, there would be a lot of data to load resulting in slow processing. This registry improves the loading speed when processing SQL results.</p>

  <p style="margin-left:33px"><strong>Quote Approval Wizard: </strong>Previously, when approving a quote scope (via SAMPro) and the status is set to “Approved”, the Approval wizard did not recognize the approved scope to attach to a work order. Also, the &quot;Approve All Options&quot; window wasn&#39;t updated to use the same logic as defined in 2714. This update corrects these defects.</p>
  <h5>Service Management </h5>
  <p style="margin-left:33px"><strong>Work Order viewer:</strong> This update adds an &quot;Update Tech Statuses&quot; as a new option/button that can be launched from the left-hand side of the Work Order Viewer. When selected, a modal window will display with two input fields: “From” and “To.” <br/>
    If all tech lines on a work order have the same status, the From field will be pre-populated with the status. Otherwise, a drop-down list appears to let the user select a &quot;From:&quot; status. For the To: field, a drop-down list appears to let users select a &quot;To:&quot; status and only a single status may be selected.</p>
  <h5>System</h5>
  <p style="margin-left:33px"><strong>Emailing: </strong>In case a previous update, scheduled event escalation emails were not being sent out when a SAMPro environment used the SAMPro emailer instead of XMLtoPDF.jar. This update corrects that defect. </p>

  <h5>Accounts Receivable </h5>
  <p style="margin-left:33px"><strong>Credit Card Processing:</strong> Previously, when a customer was issued a credited amount using their credit card on file, it would result in an additional charge instead of a credit.  Now transactions with a negative amount are issued as credits (not charges) on the credit card.</p>
  <h5>Invoicing</h5>
  <p style="margin-left:33px"><strong>Service Invoicing:</strong> Previously when a user would send an email where the recipient’s email address contained an apostrophe, it would trigger an error even if it was the correct email address. This update corrects that defect.</p>
  <h5>Payroll</h5>
  <p style="margin-left:33px"><strong>Employee viewer:</strong> Previously when the following registry was enabled, a warning would appear in the Employee Viewer when there were duplicate Social Security Numbers for other employees. This occurred every time the user saved, even if the SSN was not changed. Now, the warning only appears if the user edits the SSN field with a duplicate SSN. </p>
  <h5>Purchasing</h5>
  <p style="margin-left:33px"><strong>Purchase Order viewer:</strong> Previously, when a user ran the Quote Approval Wizard for a quote where a PO needs to be generated, it would result in an error. This update corrects that defect.</p>
  <h5>Service Management </h5>
  <p style="margin-left:33px"><strong>New Call viewer: </strong>This update adds a registry to New Call to not import the ServiceChannel caller field into wrkordr_cllr when importing a ServiceChannel FMMS weblog.</p>
  <p style="margin-left:33px"><strong>New Call viewer:</strong> This update adds the ability to the RequireUniquePO registry to view the existing work orders that have already been linked to the input Purchase Order. Before, the registry checked if a work order that has both the same Site and the same purchase order existed but could not allow the user to view the existing work orders.</p>

  <h5>Accounts Receivable</h5>
  <p style="margin-left:33px"><strong>Avalara:</strong> Previously, Avalara Quote processing was slow functioning, and an error message would appear when a user in Avalara had an exempt certificate. This happened because the Sales Tax Group in SAMPro should not be changed to 0.00 but is updated to 0.00 when there is an Exemption Certificate related to an Avalara transaction. This update improves the Quote processing performance and Avalara transactions in general. </p>
  <p style="margin-left:33px"><strong>Cash Receipts Journal viewer:</strong> This update gives users permission to make field changes and delete child lines for saved records with processed payments. With the enabled registry, this allows the user to zero out the A/R child rows for &quot;incorrect&quot; invoices and insert the new rows with the &quot;correct&quot; invoices, so long as the total against the processed payment matches. <br/>
    Note: If the wrong amount was processed, the users must refund the CC transaction and reprocess it.</p>

This saves processing time for users and provides enhanced recoverability in the event of externalities that currently result in document attachment failures.</p>
  <h5>Purchasing</h5>
  <p style="margin-left:33px"><strong>Purchase Order viewer:</strong> This update prevents users from saving a Purchase Order if a tab mismatch has occurred on the page. This is done to prevent the user from saving data with an error in it, forcing the user to reload the tab and re-enter data.</p>

  <p style="margin-left:33px"><strong>Cash Requirements Reportlcv:</strong> This update allows the total of the Payment Amt column, which is already sensitive to input of  partial payments specified in the Select Invoices for Payment function, to only reflect amounts that qualified as Current. “Current” is defined by the user input when specifying start and end dates for running the report. This allows users a way to predict a check run to the penny before actually executing. Previously, support instructed clients to use the Current column as a prediction of a check run, but this column was never sensitive to partial payment information.</p>
  <h5>System</h5>
  <p style="margin-left:33px"><strong>Start Email Test: </strong>This update allows users who have selected the Use Java Mailer? option to send email tests with commas included in the text.

  <p style="margin-left:33px"><span style="font-weight:bold;">AR Sales Journal Viewer:</span> This update adds an Invoice Billed Amount to the AR Sales Journal list called “InvoiceAmt.” This new column is between the Client Name and Trans Id when users select the sort by ARSalesByInvoiceId.

  <p style="margin-left:33px"><span style="font-weight:bold;">Master Contract Viewer:</span> Previously, Master Contracts were allowed to be created for multiple sites, which produced a warning. Now when a master contract is created for duplicate sites, it produces an error and does not allow duplication.</p>
  <p style="margin-left:33px"><span style="font-weight:bold;">Renew Service Contracts:</span> Previously, running the Renew Service Contracts function renewed PM Schedule lines on equipment for inactive sites. This is unnecessary as the sites are inactive and don&#39;t need to be renewed. Now inactive sites remain inactive when running the Renew Service Contracts function.</p>
  <p style="margin-left:33px"><span style="font-weight:bold;">Work Order Viewer:</span> Previously, the Work Order Purchases Tab always displayed the incorrect quantities Received and Vouchered for a general item received on a change order, even if the items had been received. In this release, the quantities Received and Vouchered are always displayed correctly.</p>

    •    Remove the &quot;%&quot; from all lines</p>
  <h5>Payroll</h5>
  <p style="margin-left:33px"><span style="font-weight:bold;">Compute PR: </span>This update resolves an issue with the Job Cost posting the regular rate instead of the BLENDED rate when an employee has accumulated over time. Before, posting to GL correctly used the BLENDED rate but posting to JobCost used the REGULAR rate from the employee record.</p>
  <p style="margin-left:33px"><span style="font-weight:bold;">Labor Journal viewer:</span> In this update, the WO ID on the labor lines from the labor journal does not re-load or overwrite the TA source RN when changing the WO Id so that the TA source RN carries over to new transactions. Overriding the WO Id was caused by changing the WO ID on some of the technician labor journal lines because it was created for the wrong client site.</p>
  <h5>Service Management</h5>
  <p style="margin-left:33px"><span style="font-weight:bold;">New Call viewer: </span>This update provides reminders for past due payments for invoices made via the NewCall COD Job&#39;s setup.

This is the new default behavior. This addresses an issue when customers receive an OS Error 16r6 when selecting &quot;Adobe PDF&quot; when printing. This is due to a new Adobe version update (released 1/12/22), resulting in a failure to post (e.g., Service Invoice) or other issues where a print confirmation is required.</p>

  <h5>Accounts Receivable</h5>

  <p style="margin-left: 44px"><span style="font-weight:bold;">Alert When Opening Viewer from DBAnalytics:</span> In previous releases, when two accounts were working on the same Work Order, saving would result in an error alert for another WO number. Now when two users are editing the same WO without saving changes, an alert prompts users to save work for the WO being edited. </p>
  <p style="margin-left: 44px"><strong>DashBoard Helper:</strong> In this release, the web session start code has been revised to make an assessment of currently occupied &quot;ports&quot; that fall within a Registry-defined &quot;Port Range&quot; so that an available port conforms to the range can be dynamically assigned.</p>
  <h5>Inventory </h5>
  <p style="margin-left: 36pt"><strong>IM Adjustments Journal viewer:</strong> In previous releases, the IM Adjustment Transaction Type did not require a “from” location and allowed data to be entered in the job or work order fields. The new release now requires the “from” location field to be completed and does not allow any data entered in the job or work order fields.</p>
  <h5>Invoicing</h5>
  <p style="margin-left: 39pt"><strong>Next Invoice Stored Material:</strong> This field is used to record Stored Material for AIA Billing. Enter the desired amount to reflect on the AIA billing, and note that this value should also be encompassed in the Cntrct NxtInv amount for that particular bill item.  There is no functionality to &quot;release&quot; Stored Material values on subsequent invoices for that job; those values are adjusted manually by the user.  Specifying stored materials is simply telling the customer how much of the amount the user invoiced is stored materials. If users want to JUST bill for stored materials, ensure the next invoice amount and the stored materials amount are equal. Contact your Data-Basics Support Representative for details on invoicing formats to support this information.</p>
  <p style="margin-left: 39pt"><strong>Revised Report Service Invoice:</strong> These revised Service Invoice reports support the Bitmap Override by Dispatcher functionality. When printing Service Invoices, the system will look at the Client Site record referenced in the Work Order to find the Dispatch Id to check for an override id match. If it is referenced in the registry, the override bitmap will be used. If an override bitmap is NOT specified, the system will use the standard bitmap (Setting Key: bitmap) specified in the registry.</p>
  <h5>Job/ Job Cost</h5>
  <p style="margin-left: 36pt"><strong>Job Billing Item CO/Request Viewers: </strong>For required fields for Job Billing Change Orders and Requests, users were able to bypass the required fields and save. The &quot;required field&quot; registries are now reading correctly, and users are no longer able to save or add without adding a field specified as required by the registry.</p>
  <p style="margin-left: 36pt"><strong>Job Cloning:</strong> Currently, users are alerted if they did not save. After the prompt, if they hit yes, required fields validation sets in. Then the required fields are necessary to complete before saving again.</p>

  <p style="margin-left: 48px;"><span style="font-weight: bold;">Compute OT:</span> This release resolves a bug for users not assigned to ALL Group when creating a Labor Journal that would result in an error message.</p>
  <p style="margin-left: 48px;"><strong>Labor Journal Viewer:</strong> This release supports a registry-controlled emulation for including Earnings and Deduction Groups from the Employee Recurring Wages tab for Recurring Labor entries.</p>
  <p style="margin-left: 48px;"><strong>Payroll:</strong> Payroll 941S updated to support larger quarterly wage/tax amounts fields.Previously, Wages more than $9,999,999.99 in a quarter were subject to truncation, now support $99,999,999.99.

  <h5>System</h5>

This release solves this issue by caching the SAMPro base directory at login so that SAMPro can always find the XmlToPdf.jar file. </p>
  <p style="margin-left: 33pt"><span style="font-weight:bold;">Quick Attach:</span> In quick attach, the cancel alert said “file selection was cancelled. Please click Yes to continue.” The button said OK. Now it’s changed to “file selection was cancelled. Please click OK to continue.”</p>
  <p style="margin-left: 33pt"><span style="font-weight:bold;">MessageBox Icons:</span> In previous releases, many of our SAMPro message boxes used the Microsoft &quot;Warning&quot; Icon, when they were not actual warnings. In this release, the Microsoft &quot;Information&quot; Icon is used when appropriate.</p>
  <p style="margin-left: 33pt"><span style="font-weight:bold;margin-left:4px">Viewers (general):</span> Users now have their user ID displayed on the SAMPro title bar. This is helpful for users to know which license they are using for SAMPro. </p>

  <h5>System</h5>
  <p style="font-weight: bold; margin-left: 48px;">All Viewers: Combined Add/Save Sidebar Button: <span style="font-weight: normal;">In all previous versions of SAMPro, separate buttons were used to Add a new record or Change an existing record. This was useful for managing record cloning as the Add button would be enabled what a new record was started.  In this release, a single button will be used to save or add a record.  The addition of the + sign to the button when the record is in Add mode will provide a visual clue that a new record is being added while maintaining the standard usage of a single button for the Save process.</span></p>
