<p class="Support_Heading_1">Inventory Physical Count - Keystone</p>
<p class="Support_Heading_2">Purpose:</p>
<p class="Support">This function enables the user to enter physical count information by location.</p>
<p class="Support_Heading_2">Usage:</p>
<p class="Support">Now prepends the lot number with the first character of the lot status.</p>
<p class="Support">Untested lots are no longer allowed to be entered into the physical inventory record.</p>
<p class="Support">Quantities for rejected lots now posted to qntty-rjctd rather than qntty-on-hnd.</p>
<p class="Support">Compute Adjustments now takes lot&#39;s status into account.</p>
<p class="Support">Make Uncounted Entries now takes lot&#39;s status into account.</p>
<p class="Support_Heading_2">Step 0: (Optional)</p>
<p class="Support">Many users run a custom report that lists the inventory items at the location being counted. This report is used for the physical counting process, and then is used as the input document in step 1.3a. Contact your Data-Basics support representative for additional information.</p>
<p class="Support_Heading_2">Step 1: Initial Generation Of the Physical Count Batch</p>
<p class="Support">User brings up a blank Physical Count Batch in the Physical Count Viewer.</p>
<p class="Support">The following information must be entered: Location Id and Count Date (which serves as the effective date of the transaction) .</p>
<p class="Support">When you click the Add Record button, the System generates a Physical Count Batch based on the data entered by the user. A Batch Id is automatically assigned to the new batch.</p>
<p class="Support_Heading_2">Step 2: (Optional)</p>
<p class="Support">If you did not print a custom report to use as the input for recording the physical count, click the Print Report button, and flag the “Include Missing Items” box. A report listing all items the system thinks are at this location will appear.</p>
<p class="Support">The reported will be sorted by Count Location and Item Id.</p>
<p class="Support_Heading_2">Step 3: Entering Of Count Information</p>
<p class="Support">The user brings up the desired batch in the Physical Count Viewer.</p>
<p class="Support">The user enters the quantity counted and optionally the counter’s Id for each Inventory Item counted.</p>
<p class="Support">To enter adjusting entries for items that did not appear on the shelf, click the Uncounted Entry button.</p>
<p class="Support">The user presses the Change (Delta) button to save the updated batch.</p>
<p class="Support_Heading_2">Step 4: Computing Adjustments</p>
<p class="Support">The user brings up the desired batch in the Physical Count Viewer.</p>
<p class="Support">The user presses the Compute Adjustments Button</p>
<p class="Support">The system compares the entered counts to the on-hand quantities computed from the Inventory History file. The batch’s Count Date (which must be filled in) is used as the cutoff for the Effective Date field in the Inventory History file. This results in the on-hand quantities being computed as of the specific date.</p>
<p class="Support">The appropriate adjusting quantities are computed and added to the batch lines.</p>
<p class="Support">The user presses the Change (Delta) button to save the updated batch.</p>
<p class="Support_Heading_2">Step 5: Reviewing The Results</p>
<p class="Support">The user brings up the desired batch in the Physical Count Viewer.</p>
<p class="Support">The user presses the Print Report Button</p>
<p class="Support">A report summarizing the batch is printed.</p>
<p class="Support_Heading_2">Step 6: Posting The Adjustments</p>
<p class="Support">The user brings up the desired batch in the Physical Count Viewer.</p>
<p class="Support">The user presses the Post Adjustments Button.</p>
<p class="Support">Adjusting entries are made into the Inventory History file, which make the on-hand quantities match the counted quantities.</p>
<p class="Support">NOTE: No adjusting GL entries are made.</p>
<p class="Support">Warning: Prior to posting, Recompute Adjustments should be run if any historical information may have been changed.</p>
