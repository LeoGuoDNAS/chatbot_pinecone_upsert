 <P class="support" >&nbsp;Start Work Order Batch Closed</P>
 <P class="Style_Support_+_Left___0_5_" >This function has been changed so that only Work Orders that are Cancelled or Billed will be eligible for closure.

 <P class="Style_Support_+_Left___0_5_" >By default, this function has been altered so that it now operates as follows: </P>

Clear the Escalation Profile Rn for qualifying 'closed' work orders.&nbsp; This is done to prevent the creation of additional escalation events in the event someone edits a 'closed' work order.</P>

 <P class="Support_Heading_2" >1.1 Data-Conversion / File Import Utility</P>
 <P class="support" >Rick’s data conversion/file import notes are now included in this help file as <A href="file_import_utility.htm">File Import Utility</A> .</P>
 <P class="Support_Heading_2" >1.2 Document Viewer</P>
 <P class="support" >In previous releases, documents attached to specific client site equipment, job cost code, and job billing items would also appear on other records with identical Id’s in their corresponding viewers. This problem has been corrected; documents now attach to the Rn, not the Id. </P>
 <P class="Style1" >1.3 SAMPro and TechAnywhere Licensing Protection</P>
 <P class="support" >Beginning with the release of v6.2, use of a vrgstry.cus file is a requirement – even if the registry is disabled in the v.cus file or if you are running in development mode. This means pre-v6.2 registry files must be replaced during the conversion to v6.2. The same process will apply as each new version is released and installed.</P>
 <P class="support" >If you are setting up a v6.2 test environment for an existing user, the 6.2 zip file now includes a vrgstryWinII.cus file.&nbsp; This file can be used on a temporary basis (it will need to be renamed vrgstry.cus).&nbsp; It has all SAMPRO modules enabled, but it currently sets a limited expiration date and only allows one full-access user.<BR><BR>Terreathe can make the permanent file for any installation that needs one.</P>
 <P class="Style1" >1.3.1 Users Database</P>
 <P class="support" >SAMPRO's user licensing technology has been enhanced to use the lgnhstry table from the main database instead of the usrstble in a separate Users database.&nbsp; If the LicenseMethod is set to LogonHistory in the vrgstry file, this enhanced license methodology will be used. </P>
 <P class="support" >This change should simplify both the installation and support of new and converted SAMPRO installations.&nbsp; Please note that the logon process no longer results in any uncommitted database transactions.</P>
 <P class="Style1" >1.3.2 Using the New Method</P>
 <P class="support" >A valid login uid &amp; password combination will never be denied, instead that log-in will be accepted and any current session for the same UID will be disabled (not logged out - DISABLED).&nbsp; The DISABLED session will be able to finish any unsaved edit, but will not be able to proceed otherwise.&nbsp; A message will then be displayed that the session is disabled and the account must be logged in again.&nbsp; This could go back and forth.</P>
 <P class="Style1" >1.3.3 Active User Count Strictly Enforced in 6.2</P>
 <P class="support" >Version 6.2 and up strictly enforce the number of active users specified in the vrgstry file. This is a change from 6.1, where a greater number of users flagged as ‘active’ was permitted as long as no more than the allowed number were logged on concurrently.  If this impacts your users, they may purchase additional licenses.  The ‘sharing’ of a seat license is not to be encouraged as all history of an individual user is lost.  This practice has negative ramifications for system security since individual responsibility for transactions is not maintained. </P>
 <P class="Style1" >1.3.4 Logon History Viewer</P>
 <P class="support" >A viewer has been created for the lgnhstry table as of 6.2.408.000.b0314; run the Start Function Update function to see the new viewer if needed.  This viewer allows for the termination of active sessions.  </P>
 <P class="Support_Heading_2" >1.3.5 TechAnywhere Licensing Protection</P>
 <P class="support" >TechAnywhere licensing information is be stored in the vrgstry.cus file, which enables TechAnywhere and specifies the maximum number of Technician records to be flagged as having Technician Web Access <FONT style="text-decoration:underline;" >and</FONT> Remote Device set to CE or XP.  If this number is exceeded, you must edit the records to reduce the count  (or obtain more licenses and a new vrgstry.cus file) before you can add a new Web Access Technician record, or change an existing Technician record to Technician Web Access. </P>
 <P class="Support_Heading_1" >1.4 Start Purge Record Change Log</P>
 <P class="Support_Heading_2" >Purpose:</P>
 <P class="support" >Performance when opening viewers can be negatively impacted by the number of records in the rcrdchngelg table. This table is automatically maintained by the system and lists the record that was changed, the user that changed it, and the date and time of the change.

 <P class="Support_Heading_2" >Purpose</P>
 <P class="support" >It would sometimes be helpful to support if it could be determined what users are logged into the system and what functions they are currently running. The User Status Tracking mechanism provides this functionality. It is anticipated that this feature will be extended to include the logging of what activities the user has engaged in since entering a function.</P>

 <P class="Support_Heading_2" >2.1 Registry Entry to Override Windows Registry Associations</P>
 <P class="support" >This registry entry was developed to work around a problem that we encountered with scanning. On one of the computers used to test scanning, Smalltalk was not able to understand about the Windows registry regarding file associations.  When you attempted to view the scanned document, the message ‘Application not found’ was displayed.&nbsp; The work around for now is to use the new SAMPRO registry entry that overrides the Windows registry.&nbsp; </P>

 <P class="support" >sys-openapp-commands</P>
 <P class="Style_Support_+_Left___0_5_" >The first format lets you specify associations by branch id and (optionally) user.  If this entry is specific to a user, the branch must be specified if a user belongs to a branch.

 <P class="Support_Heading_2" >2.7 Internal Registry Start Purge Record Change Log</P>
 <P class="Style1" >Purpose:</P>
 <P class="support" >The following registry entry may be used to control what record change records are purged when this function is run.</P>

 <P class="Support_Heading_1" >3 Job Cost Category - Labor Posting as jchstry_type = &quot;Other&quot; </P>
 <P class="support" >The <A href="version_6_2_customer_release_notes.htm">Version 6.2 Release Notes</A>  for customers discuss the basic use of the new Selection Cost Type to post labor to job history as type ‘other’.  This discussion looks at the premise and considerations for doing so.</P>
 <P class="Support_Heading_2" >Premise:</P>
 <P class="support" >&quot;Labor&quot; cost for employees engaged in engineering activities is not desirable for inclusion in Job Cost Labor calculations as it impact GM/Labor ratios. &nbsp;Currently &quot;engineering&quot; time is posted w/ AVG. HOURLY RATE =$0.00 to avoid undesirable impact to job cost reports. &nbsp;The ability to select cost categories with cost types other than &quot;Labor&quot;, specifically &quot;Other&quot;, for lines of labor entered via the Labor Journal would overcome the undesirable impact by allowing an average hourly cost rate to be classified as &quot;other&quot; cost in job history. <BR></P>
 <P class="Support_Heading_2" >Considerations:</P>
 <P class="support" >Systematically job history lines originating from the stated source journals post &quot;units&quot; into the field jchstry_hrs...and units from &quot;non-labor&quot; sources are posted to the field jchstry_qntty. &nbsp;In this way the following statement has historically been true...when jchstry_type = labor, units are found in jchstry_hrs, when jchstry_type &lt;&gt; labor, units are found in the field jchstry_qntty. &nbsp;<BR><BR>This principle has been applied to a number of reports and after the implementation of this request there will be certain reports (Job Cost Details, for example) where the lines subject to the modification will be presented in the &quot;Other Cost&quot; details section of the report which will not have knowledge that data exists in the field jchstry_hrs, so that information will not be displayed. &nbsp;Calculations that are based on &quot;cost / hours&quot; could also be affected in some existing reports.<BR><BR>Each report adversely affected by these circumstances CAN be enhanced to accommodate the new logic, but those modifications, if desired / required are outside of the scope of this specification and quote.</P>
