<h1>Start Compute Corporate Metrics</h1>
<h2>Purpose:</h2>
<p>Corporate Metrics enables users of the Shop Order, Service (Work Order), 
 Client Order and Purchase Order modules to evaluate inventory metrics 
 by running this function.</p>
<p>The Compute Corporate Metrics may also be use to recomputation of the 
 Reorder Level and Order Up To (Min/Max) fields. Typically, this would 
 be done for a period of less than a year. For example, we could capture 
 historical startup parts usage from the previous spring and use them to 
 generate appropriate Reorder/Order Up To levels to assure an adequate 
 stock new spring.</p>
<p>This re-computation will ONLY occurs if you check the Compute box for 
 Min/Max (Reorder Level/Order Up To) in the Compute Corporate Metrics Checklist 
 screen. If this option is checked, the software does not allow ANY other 
 option to be checked, and also validates that the Stock days (from the 
 range screen) is greater than 0. Note that the date range specified on 
 the range screen would be for prior historical periods therefore wouldn&#39;t 
 be applicable to any other metric calculations.</p>
<p>If the Show Log option is selected on the range screen, the system will 
 display the original min/max and the new min/max for each part calculated.</p>
<h2>Usage:</h2>
<p>This function will compute the various metrics for the date range that 
 you select and store them in the appropriate records.</p>
<h2>Registries:</h2>
<p style="margin-left: 8px;">See <a href="Start_Compute_Corporate_Metrics.htm">Registry 
 Start Compute Corporate Metrics</a> for a registry to set initial values 
 for this function&#39;s range screen.</p>
<p>See <a href="Registry_Compute_Metrics.htm">Registry Compute Metrics</a> 
 for an option to refine the calculation of Inventory Turns.</p>
<h2>Range Screen: Important Fields</h2>
<p><font style="font-weight: bold;">Start Date: End Date:<br/>
</font>Enter the date range for which you wish to compute metrics and Reorder/Order 
 Up To levels. These fields are required. The date range determines the 
 period for which the usage is calculated for.</p>
<p><font style="font-weight: bold;">Lead Time Add On:<br/>
</font>Enter the number of days that will be added to the system-calculated 
 Purchasing Lead Time to allow for internal time needed to create and receive 
 a purchase order. This field used in conjunction with the average daily 
 use of the item (by Location) to calculate the Reorder Level as follows:</p>
<p>[Average Daily Quantity Used or Sold] *([Vendor Lead Time] + [Lead Time 
 Add On])</p>
<p><font style="font-weight: bold;">Stock Days:<br/>
</font>The number of days the user would like to keep inventory on hand. 
 This field is used in conjunction with the average daily use of the item 
 (by Location) to calculate the Order Up To level as follows:</p>
<p>[Average Daily Quantity Used or Sold] *[Stock Days]</p>
<p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"> </p>
<p><font style="font-weight: bold;">Inventory Item Id:<br/>
</font>If this field is blank, metrics will be computed for all inventory 
 items which may take a significant amount of time. To limit the computation, 
 enter an Item or list of (comma-separated) items in this range.</p>
<p><font style="font-weight: bold;">Inventory Group:<br/>
</font> This range allows users to run the calculation for a select group 
 of inventory.</p>
<p><font style="font-weight: bold;">Location Id:<br/>
</font>If completed, the Inventory Item Location fields (including the 
 Turns field) will only be updated for the specified location. The Location 
 Id field will not be used for any other purpose.</p>
<p><font style="font-weight: bold;">Inventory Group:<br/>
</font>This range may be completed to filter the Inventory Items that are 
 to be updated.</p>
<p><font style="font-weight: bold;">Show Log:<br/>
</font>If this box is checked, a diagnostic log of the computations is 
 displayed in a pop up box.</p>
<p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"> </p>
<p><img src="assets/images/image/go.gif" alt="image\go.gif" title="image\go.gif" width="48" height="28" border="0"/> Click Go to display the next screen.</p>
<h2>List Screen: Important Fields</h2>
<p>The list screen for this function will contain a check box for each 
 metric described below. The corresponding metric will be computed only 
 if the corresponding box is checked.</p>
<p><font style="font-weight: bold;">Compute</font> <font style="font-weight: bold;">Purchases 
 On Time</font></p>
<p style="margin-left: 18.00pt;">Purchasing Lead Time for a Vendor /Item 
 will be displayed in the Percent On Time Requested and Percent On Time 
 Promised fields on the Inventory Item Viewer’s Vendors tab.</p>
<p style="margin-left: 18.00pt;">The Purchasing On Time statistics for 
 a Vendor/Item will be computed from your Purchase Orders by comparing 
 the Request / Promised PO fields with the date the items are actually 
 received.</p>
<p><font style="font-weight: bold;">Compute</font> <font style="font-weight: bold;">Sales 
 On Time</font></p>
<p><font style="font-weight: bold;">Compute I</font><font style="font-weight: bold;">nventory 
 Turns</font></p>
<p style="margin-left: 36.00pt;">Turns are computed both on an Inventory 
 Item and on an Inventory Item / Location basis.</p>
<p style="margin-left: 36.00pt;">Inventory Item Turns for the item in general 
 are displayed on the Inventory Performance tab. Inventory Item / Location 
 turns appear on the Inventory Item Viewer’s Locations tab; click the magnify 
 button to view the Turns detail for his location.</p>
<p style="margin-left: 36.00pt;">The number of turns over a given period 
 will be computed as the total usage over the period divided by the average 
 on-hand quantity over that same period.</p>
<p style="margin-left: 36.00pt;">If the period is other than one year, 
 the annualized turns number is computed as the number of turns for the 
 period multiplied by the number of periods in the year. The annualized 
 number of turns that will be saved in the Inventory Item and Inventory 
 Item Location tables. The number of turns (general and by Location) appear 
 in the Stock Status Report.</p>





















<p><font style="font-weight: bold;">Compute Min/Max (Reorder Level/Order 
 Up To)</font></p>
<p style="margin-left: 36.00pt;">The Reorder Level/Order Up to computations 
 will ONLY occur if this box is checked. If this option is checked, the 
 software does not allow ANY other option to be checked, and also validates 
 that the Stock days (from the range screen) is greater than 0.</p>
<p style="margin-left: 36.00pt;">When you click the Go button, the selected 
 Metrics will be generated and Reorder / Order Up To levels calculated 
 on the Inventory Item Location tab.</p>
<p><font style="font-weight: bold;">Compute</font> <font style="font-weight: bold;">Manufacturing 
 Lead Time</font></p>
<p style="margin-left: 36.00pt;">Manufacturing Lead Time is an indication 
 of the number of days required to manufacture an item; it will be displayed 
 in the Inventory Item viewer.</p>
<p style="margin-left: 36.00pt;">The manufacturing time for a shop order 
 is computed as the number of days between the Entry Date (the Open Date) 
 and the Close Date of the Shop Order. A Shop Order that was closed on 
 the same date it was opened will have a manufacturing time of zero.</p>
<p style="margin-left: 36.00pt;">The Manufacturing Lead Time for an item 
 is computed as the average manufacturing time for all Shop Orders for 
 the item. Only Shop Orders that were both opened and closed within the 
 date range will be considered in performing this calculation.</p>
<p style="margin-left: 36.00pt;">The suggested usage period is one year. 
 .</p>
<p><font style="font-weight: bold;">Sales Lead Time</font></p>
<p style="margin-left: 36.00pt;">Sales Lead Time is an indication of your 
 organization’s ability to fill Client Orders. It is displayed in the Inventory 
 Item viewer.</p>
<p style="margin-left: 36.00pt;">The lead time is computed as the number 
 of days between request and ship dates for the item. The request date 
 for an item is taken from the order line’s ‘Date To Ship’ field. If this 
 field is blank, the order will be considered an ‘ASAP’ order and the request 
 date will be taken from the order’s ‘Date Ordered’ field.</p>
<p style="margin-left: 36.00pt;">If multiple shipments were required to 
 fill the order, the lead time will be computed as the ‘weighted average’ 
 of the lead times for each shipment. For example, consider an order that 
 was fulfilled in two shipments. The first shipment was for a quantity 
 of 90 lbs and was fulfilled in 3 days with the remaining 10 lbs filled 
 4 days later. The lead time will be computed as<br/>
 ((3 * 90) * (7 * 10)) / 100 = 3.4 days.</p>
<p style="margin-left: 36.00pt;">Only COP lines having complete shipments 
 are considered when computing Sales Lead Time.</p>
<p style="margin-left: 36.00pt;">Only orders within the ‘sample period’ 
 will be considered in performing this calculation. The suggested usage 
 period is one year (i.e. within 365 days prior to the running of the report).</p>
<p><font style="font-weight: bold;">Purchasing Lead Time</font></p>
<p style="margin-left: 36.00pt;">Purchasing Lead Time is an indication 
 of your vendors’ ability to fill your Purchase Orders. Purchasing Lead 
 Time for a Vendor /Item will be displayed in the existing ‘Lead’ field 
 on the Inventory Item Viewer’s Vendors tab.</p>
<p style="margin-left: 36.00pt;">Purchasing Lead Time for a Vendor/Item 
 is computed from your Purchase Orders. The lead time for an item on a 
 Purchase Order is computed as the number of days between Date Requested 
 and received dates for the item. If the Date Requested field is left blank, 
 the PO will be considered as an ‘ASAP’ order and the request date will 
 be taken from the PO’s ‘Released’ date field.</p>
<p style="margin-left: 36.00pt;">If multiple shipments were required to 
 fill the order, the lead time will be computed as the ‘weighted average’ 
 of the lead times for each shipment. Only PO lines having complete shipments 
 are considered when computing Purchasing Lead Time.</p>
<p style="margin-left: 36.00pt;">Only orders entered within the usage period 
 will be considered in performing this calculation. The suggested usage 
 period is one year (i.e. within 365 days prior to the running of the report).</p>
