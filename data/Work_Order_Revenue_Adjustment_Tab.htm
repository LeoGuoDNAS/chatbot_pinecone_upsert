<h1>Work Order Revenue Adjustment Tab</h1>
<h3>Option 1: Entries Generated by Clicking the Adjust Revenue Button</h3>
<p><a data-target="POPUP686358676" data-rhwidget="DropSpot" href="#" class="dropspot"><span data-open-text="true" data-skip-index="true">Click to see 
 details.</span><span data-close-text="true">Click to see 
 details.</span></a></p>
<div data-targetname="POPUP686358676">
	<p>Revenue adjustments enable you to discount/mark up labor, material 
	 and other charges on Service work orders, and to add management fees 
	 to the total. Clicking the Adjust Revenue button on the Gross Margin 
	 tab automatically creates the entries on this tab AND deletes existing 
	 unbilled lines. The Adjust Revenue button should be clicked <font style="font-weight: bold;">after</font> the Import Costs button has 
	 been clicked, and all costs have been imported to the work order (so 
	 that revenues can be adjusted correctly).</p></div>
<h3>Option 2: Entries Generated by Create PM Billing</h3>
<p><a data-target="POPUP686396321" data-rhwidget="DropSpot" href="#" class="dropspot"><span data-open-text="true" data-skip-index="true">Click to see 
 PM Billing Details.</span><span data-close-text="true">Click to see 
 PM Billing Details.</span></a></p>
<div data-targetname="POPUP686396321">
	<p>When the Create PM Billing function is used to generate PM Invoice 
	 Work Orders (used for invoicing only), the billing amount is written 
	 to this Tab. This Tab also accommodates the PM Accrual aspect of billing 
	 PM&#39;s from the client site bill tab.</p>
	<p>When accruals are being performed the invoice that is generated 
	 needs to credit a liability account rather than Income since the Income 
	 was recognized in advance of the invoice being generated.  Revenue 
	 Adjustment Tab entries created by the Create PM Billing function do 
	 not require any human intervention.</p>
	<p style="margin-left: 48px;"><font style="font-weight: bold;">Important 
	 Note:</font> the cost category for pm billings defaults in from the 
	 registry entry sys-start-scrtepmbllng using the CostCategory option: 
	 see <a href="Registry_Create_PM_Billing_Work_Order_Invoice.htm">Registry 
	 Start Create PM Billing (sys-start-scrtepmbllng)</a> for details.</p>
	<p style="margin-left: 36.00pt;"><font style="font-weight: bold;">Import 
	 Note:</font> <font style="font-weight: bold;">PM Invoice Work Orders 
	 and PreventiveMaint Work Orders<br/>
	</font> When the work order&#39;s Work Type is &#39;PM Invoice&#39;  or &#39;PreventiveMaint&#39;, 
	 changes are not allowed on this tab, including line inserts and deletes. 
	 Registry entries are available to override this, but is not recommended.</p></div>
<h3>Option 3: Entries Generated by Create PM Work Orders (Time of Service 
 Earned)</h3>
<p>Click to see <a data-target="POPUP686432804" data-rhwidget="DropSpot" href="#" class="dropspot"><span data-open-text="true" data-skip-index="true">Time 
 of Service Earned Details</span><span data-close-text="true">Time 
 of Service Earned Details</span></a>.</p>
<div data-targetname="POPUP686432804">
	<p>This tab is also written to by Time of Service Earned Master Contracts 
	 (and the equivalent entries on the Client Site Equipment PM Schedule 
	 tabs with the &#39;Accrual&#39; field flagged).  *ACCRUAL* is used as 
	 a special marker when PM Work Orders are generated; these lines do 
	 not post to  directly to JCH.  When the PM Invoice is printed 
	 and posted, the appropriate GL and Job Cost entries will be made to 
	 recognize the earned revenue values. This change will prevent new 
	 PM work orders generated with Revenue Adjustments marked as &#39;*ACCRUAL*&#39; 
	 from generating Tab Mismatch errors when closed from the Dispatch 
	 Board.  Note that all validation prevents editing/deleting all &#39;special&#39; 
	 PM Accrual-type Revenue Adjustment lines.</p></div>
<h3>Option 4: Entries Generated by the Quote Approval Wizard</h3>
<h2>Important Fields:</h2>
<p><font style="font-weight: bold;">Invoice Description:<br/>
</font>This field defaults from the Revenue Adjustment record (if generated 
 via option 1); they may be changed by the user.</p>
<p>This field defaults from the Invoice Description on the Site PM Billing 
 tab or Master Contract if generated via option 2. A <a href="Registry_Create_PM_Billing_Work_Order_Invoice.htm">registry 
 setting</a> provides a default description for the PM Invoice if the Invoice 
 Description is blank on the Client Site PM Billing tab or the Master Contract 
 Adv. Billing tab.  The phrase &quot;PM Invoice&quot; will be written 
 to PM Invoice Work Orders if the above registry option is not implemented, 
 and an Invoice Description is also absent from the Client Site and/or 
 Master Contract billing tabs.  </p>
<p>Validation prevents all &#39;special&#39; PM Accrual-type Revenue Adjustment 
 lines from being edited or deleted:</p>
<p style="margin-left: 48px;">New style lines have an Invoice Description 
 that ends with &#39;*ACCRUAL*&#39;.<br/>
Old style lines have an Invoice Description of either &#39;PM Income&#39; or &#39;PM 
 Billed in Advance&#39;.</p>
<p><font style="font-weight: bold;">o Add o Deduct o ApplyPrepay<br/>
</font>This field controls whether the dollars on this line will be added 
 to or deducted from the invoice. By default, management fees will be added 
 to the invoice.</p>
<p>Lines flagged as ApplyPrepay were generated by PM&#39;s and should not be 
 changed by the user.</p>
<p><font style="font-weight: bold;">Effective Date:<br/>
</font>The date to alter the appropriate account balances. This field will 
 default to today’s date when this line is created by clicking the Adjust 
 Revenue button. The + and – let you increase or decrease the date.</p>
<p style="margin-left: 48px;"><span style="font-weight: bold;">Lines from 
 Quote Manager:</span><span> When the Work Order is set to Invoice Ready 
 and saved, the Effective Date of Quoted lines and Revenue Adjustments 
 from Quote Manager will be updated to the Work Order Date Work Completed 
 (if set). In previous releases, the Effective Date of these lines was 
 set to the origination date of the Quote. Since this date could be months 
 in the past, revenue was recognized way too early through the Job EOM 
 function. See <a href="Quoted_and_Rev_Adjustment_Line_Dates.htm">Quote 
 and Rev Adjust Lines</a> for details.</span></p>
<p><font style="font-weight: bold;">AdjBase: Rate: Amount:</font></p>
<p><font style="text-decoration: underline; ">Adds / Deducts</font></p>
<p style="margin-left: 36.00pt;">For standard charges, the system calculates 
 the Adjustment Base by summing up this type of charge (labor, material, 
 other and sub), not including exceptions noted on the Revenue Adjustments 
 Exceptions tab. The Rate defaults from the appropriate Rate field in the 
 upper section of the Revenue Adjustment table. The system calculates separate 
 Adjustment Base and Rate lines for Labor, Other or Subcontract Rates (and 
 Inventory Group Id’s) listed on the Revenue Adjustment record’s Exception 
 tabs. In either case, the Amount is calculated by the system by multiplying 
 the Adjustment Base times the Rate.</p>
<p style="text-decoration: underline; ">Management Fees</p>
<p style="margin-left: 36.00pt;">If the management fee line was generated 
 from a line flagged as Flat Fee in the Revenue Adjustments record, both 
 the Adjustment Base and the Rate will be blank, and the Amount will be 
 the flat fee. Otherwise, the Adjustment Base is calculated from the discounted 
 total of Labor, Material and other Charges, and multiplied times the Rate 
 (in the Revenue Adjustments record) to obtain the Amount.</p>
<p><font style="font-weight: bold;">Cost Category:<br/>
</font>For discounts, this field defaults from the first line of the Labor, 
 Inventory or Other tabs of the Work Order, as applicable for this line. 
 The Cost Category for Management Fees defaults from the Revenue Adjustment 
 record.</p>
<p style="margin-left: 36.00pt;"><font style="font-weight: bold;">Important 
 Note:</font> the cost category for pm billings defaults in from the registry 
 entry sys-start-scrtepmbllng using the CostCategory option: see <a href="Registry_Create_PM_Billing_Work_Order_Invoice.htm">Registry 
 Start Create PM Billing (sys-start-scrtepmbllng)</a> for details.</p>
<p style="margin-left: 8px;"><span>This field supports enhanced filtering 
 provided by the Cost Code&#39;s Job Cost Category Usage Filter. Cost Categories 
 are validated (relative to Cost Codes) during data entry upon leaving 
 the Cost Category Id field.  The full relationship is validated again 
 when leaving a child line or saving a record.</span></p>
<p><font style="font-weight: bold;">Invoice Sequence:<br/>
</font>Reserved for future use.</p>
<p><font style="font-weight: bold;">GL Account:<br/>
</font>This field defaults from corresponding field in the Revenue Adjustment 
 record or Client Site PM Schedule (option 2).</p>
<p><font style="font-weight: bold;">GL Entity:<br/>
Job Id: Cost Code: Billing Item: Tax Type:<br/>
</font>These fields default from the first lines of the Labor, Inventory 
 or Other tabs of the Work Order, as applicable for this entry. They may 
 be changed by the user if needed. If this entry was generated via option 
 2, these fields will default from the Client Site PM Schedule.</p>
<p><a href="Registry_Entry_Global_Settings__Column_Compression__Dispatch_Board_Rows__History_Log_Inventory_Markup.htm#global_settings_rev_adj_management_fee_tax_type">Set 
 Tax Type on Revenue Adjustment Management Fee</a> is a recommend global 
 setting that impacts the Quote and Work Order.</p>
<p><font style="font-weight: bold;">PSeq#:<br/>
</font>The Print Sequence Number sets the order that multiple revenue adjustment 
 lines will print on the invoice.</p>
<p><font style="font-weight: bold;">Invoice Number:<br/>
</font>This display-only field will be completed by the system when the 
 invoice is printed.</p>
