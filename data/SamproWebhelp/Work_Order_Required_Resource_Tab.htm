<h1>Work Order Required Resource Tab</h1>
<h2>Purpose:</h2>
<p>A special customization or series of registry entries (see below) are 
 required for this tab to appear.</p>
<h2>Usage:</h2>
<p>Lines cannot be added manually if the WO is on credit hold. If the user 
 attempts to do so, SAMPro will display the message &quot;WorkOrder is 
 on Credit Hold, this line cannot be added”.  In addition, the buttons 
 MaterialReq, ImportRR and ReleaseRR cannot be used if the Work Order is 
 on Credit Hold.</p>
<h2>Registry Entries:</h2>
<p><a href="Registry_Entry_Global_Settings__Column_Compression__Dispatch_Board_Rows__History_Log_Inventory_Markup.htm#Registry_Entry_Global_Settings_Required_Resources">Registry 
 Entry Global Settings: Required Resources</a></p>
<p><a href="Registry_Entry_to_Warn_if_Cost_Code_Requires_Certified_PR_Reporting.htm">Registry 
 Entry Work Order Options</a></p>
<p>To set the Import Required Resources File Path see <a href="Registry_Entry_to_Warn_if_Cost_Code_Requires_Certified_PR_Reporting.htm#Registry_Workorder_Import_RR_File_Path">Workorder 
 option to set Import Required Resource default directory.</a></p>
<p>See <a title="Registry Entries to Default the Vendor for Manually Entering Required Resources or Importing them From a Job Budget." href="Registry_Entry_Global_Settings__Column_Compression__Dispatch_Board_Rows__History_Log_Inventory_Markup.htm#sys-ffv-global-settings_WO_RR_Vendor">Registry 
 to Automatically Default the Vendor</a> if you want the Vendor to default 
 from the Inventory Item record.</p>
<p>This global registry to import budgets costs also impacts the RR Wizard: 
 <a href="Registry_Entry_Global_Settings__Column_Compression__Dispatch_Board_Rows__History_Log_Inventory_Markup.htm#global_settings_import_RR_costs_from_JCH">Import 
 Costs from JCH / Job Budget</a>.</p>
<h2>Important Fields:</h2>
<p><font style="font-weight: bold;">Quantity:<br/>
</font>The quantity of this resource that is likely to be needed to perform 
 this work.</p>
<p><font style="font-weight: bold;">Qty Avail: Qty On-Hand:<br/>
</font>These display-only fields are calculated by the system based on 
 the following criteria:</p>
<p style="margin-left: 36.00pt;">Quantity On-Hand and Available calculations 
 use branch-specific Material Requisitioning registry entries (sys-viewer-vshpordr-<font style="font-style: italic;">branchid</font><font style="font-style: italic;">)</font> 
 when available. The Branch Id on the WO’s Main tab is used to determine 
 the Branch.</p>
<p style="margin-left: 36.00pt;">If the Location Id field is blank, use 
 the default Location specified by the MaterialRequisitionFromLocation 
 value found in the sys-viewer-shpordr registry key.</p>
<p style="margin-left: 36.00pt;">If a Location Id is specified, calculate 
 the Qty Avail and On-Hand values based on it.</p>
<p style="margin-left: 36.00pt;">If no registry supplied Location Id is 
 specified, and the Location Id on the line is blank, display zeros.</p>
<p><font style="font-weight: bold;">Inventory Item Id: <br/>
</font>This field should be completed if the resource is an inventoried 
 item.</p>
<p>The system checks to see if a part has been superceded (the Superceded 
 By field on the Inventory Other Tab is filled in). When a superseded part 
 number is entered into this field, the system will alert the user that: 
 Item A has been superceded by Item B. Use New Item?</p>
<p>It the user clicks Yes, the new part (B) will be returned to the field. 
 If the user clicks No, part A (which has been superceded) will remain 
 in the field.</p>
<p><font style="font-weight: bold;">Description:<br/>
</font>A brief description of the resource. In the case of inventoried 
 items, this field defaults from the Inventory Item Name. If this resource 
 was generated from a Flat Rate Category, the Name will default from the 
 appropriate detail lines.</p>
<p><font style="font-weight: bold;">Date Required:<br/>
</font> This is a required field. This field is used / set in conjunction 
 with the following functions:</p>
<p style="margin-left: 36.00pt;">1. Generate PM WOs now sets the Date Required 
 to the same date as the WO&#39;s Date Scheduled.</p>
<p style="margin-left: 36.00pt;">2. Start Material Requisition posts it 
 into the Shop Order’s Date Required.</p>
<p style="margin-left: 36.00pt;">3. The WO viewer&#39;s RR wizard uses it when 
 creating of both POs and Shop Orders.</p>
<p style="margin-left: 36.00pt;">If a Flat Rate is imported, the Date on 
 the Flat Import window will be used to set the Date Required on the Required 
 Resource tab. If an inventory item is on the flat rate, the Description 
 is now set from the Inventory Item Name.</p>
<p style="margin-left: 8px;"><font style="font-weight: bold;">Requisitioned?<br/>
</font>This informational box will be checked if this resource has already 
 been requisitioned (by purchasing it from a vendor or filling it from 
 stock). Clicking the Create PO button on the side button bar launches 
 the Required Resources wizard to implement the requisition.</p>
<p><font style="font-weight: bold;">Flat Rate Id:</font> <font style="font-weight: bold;">Description:<br/>
</font>These display-only fields will be completed if this line was generated 
 as a result of importing a Flat Category.</p>
<p><font style="font-weight: bold;">Other Rate Id:<br/>
</font>Typically, this field would only be entered for non-inventoried 
 material (that will ultimately be purchased from a vendor). The Cost Category 
 Type should be set to either Material or Sub. Other Rates with a cost 
 type of Other would never be entered on this tab since they represent 
 items that would neither be bought or filled, and hence are not considered 
 part of Required Resource processing.</p>
<p style="font-weight: bold;">Cost Category:<br/>
<span style="font-weight: normal;">When an Inventory Item is added, the 
 Job Cost Category defaults from the Inventory Item&#39;s Group record. The 
 Cost Category must be of Type Material</span> <span style="font-weight: normal;">or Equipment</span> <span style="font-weight: normal;">if the Inventory Item field is completed.</span> 
 <span style="font-weight: normal;">If the Inventory Item field is not 
 completed, the Cost Category Posting/Selection Type may not be set to 
 Labor.</span></p>
<p>This field supports enhanced filtering 
 provided by the Cost Code&#39;s Job Cost Category Usage Filter. Cost Categories 
 are validated (relative to Cost Codes) during data entry upon leaving 
 the Cost Category Id field.  The full relationship is validated again 
 when leaving a child line or saving a record.</p>
<p style="margin-left: 8px; font-weight: bold;">Vendor Id:</p>
<p style="margin-left: 48px;"><span style="text-decoration: underline; ">For 
 Inventory Items:</span></p>
<p style="margin-left: 48px;">This field would only be completed for resources 
 that have been/will be bought directly from a from a Vendor rather than 
 through the whole requisitioning process. See <a title="Registry Entries to Default the Vendor for Manually Entering Required Resources or Importing them From a Job Budget." href="Registry_Entry_Global_Settings__Column_Compression__Dispatch_Board_Rows__History_Log_Inventory_Markup.htm#sys-ffv-global-settings_WO_RR_Vendor">Registry 
 to Automatically Default the Vendor</a> if you want the Vendor to default 
 from the Inventory Item record. If the 
 Vendor&#39;s No Inventory? field is checked, the Vendor may not be specified 
 on this tab. </p>
<p style="margin-left: 48px; text-decoration: underline; ">Non-Inventory 
 Materials:</p>
<p style="margin-left: 48px;">If you do not complete this field, you will 
 be prompted to do so when the Wizard is launched.</p>
<p>If the Unit Cost is not zero, and you change the Vendor Id (which may 
 change the Unit Cost), the system will prompt you to confirm the change 
 to the cost.  The user should answer &#39;No&#39; if costs are routinely 
 imported from the Job Budget.</p>
<p><font style="font-weight: bold;">Equipment Id:<br/>
</font>The Equipment this resource will be applied to. If one piece of 
 Equipment is listed on the Equipment tab, its Equipment Id will default 
 when a Required Resource line is entered. If more than one piece of Equipment 
 is listed, the Equipment Id does NOT default so that the user can select 
 the correct item. This defaulting methodology is true for lines manually 
 entered by the user as well as those imported from Job History or an external 
 file via the Import ReqRes button.</p>
<p style="margin-left: 48px;">Note: the Equipment on the Required Resource 
 pick lists is limited to the Equipment on the Work Order Equipment tab. 
 The user is not permitted to select Equipment not on the Equipment tab.</p>
<p><font style="font-weight: bold;">PO Id:</font><br/>
This display-only field will be completed by the system when the Required 
 Resource Wizard is run and a Purchase Order is generated for the Vendor 
 listed above.</p>
<p><font style="font-weight: bold;">Location Id:<br/>
</font>This field is only completed for inventoried materials that will 
 be filled from a location. If this line has not yet been requisitioned, 
 this Location will default when the Required Resources Wizard is run. 
 If you do not complete this field in the Work Order, you will be prompted 
 to do so when the Wizard is launched. Note that both the Location Id and 
 Vendor Id cannot both be completed in the same Required Resource line.</p>
<p style="margin-left: 48px;"><span style="font-weight: bold;">Location 
 Id and Vendor Id Validation:</span><span><br/>
Validation did not allow a Location and Vendor to be manually entered on 
 the same line. However, if the User runs the RR Wizard but clears the 
 OK box at the end (so that the PO was not created), both the Location 
 (defaulted from the Wizard) and Vendor are entered. The validation has 
 been refined to allow the User to clear the Vendor or Location if both 
 have been completed and the line has not been requisitioned. </span> </p>
<p><font style="font-weight: bold;">Unit Cost: Amount Cost:<br/>
</font>The cost associated with this Resource. If applicable, this line 
 defaults from the Flat Rate Category.</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: bold;">UOM:</span><br/>
Displays the Unit of Measure from the Inventory record.</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: bold;">TechAnywhere Source Rn: Technician 
 Id:</span><br/>
If these fields are completed, this record/line was created/revised from 
 TechAnywhere.</p>
<p><img src="assets/images/image/Magnify.gif" alt="image\Magnify.gif" title="image\Magnify.gif" width="18" height="18" border="0"/>  Click the Magnify button 
 to access the following fields.</p>
<p><font style="font-weight: bold;">Picked? Picked Previous</font> <font style="font-weight: bold;"><br/>
 </font>This enhancement allows Requisitioning processing to be streamlined 
 so that the Tech can simply pick selected stock items from his stocking 
 location. To record the ‘pick’ of an available stocked item, simply 
 flag the Required Resource line as Picked using the new field: the Date, 
 Time and User Id will be recorded to the appropriate fields, and the Location 
 will default to the Stocking Location for the Work Order’s branch. The 
 Requisitioned box is flagged when an item is ‘Picked’ in this fashion 
 to prevent the Start Material Requisitioning functioning from processing 
 this line again.</p>
<p><span>When the Work Order is saved, the newly picked Required Resource 
 lines will be written to the WO Inventory tab, and the appropriate Inventory 
 History generated.</span></p>
<h2>Important Buttons:</h2>
<p><img src="assets/images/image/SKIN1_ImportRR.gif" alt="image\SKIN1_ImportRR.gif" title="image\SKIN1_ImportRR.gif" width="94" height="28" border="0"/>  The Import Required 
 Resources button enables the user to add inventory and non-inventory items
