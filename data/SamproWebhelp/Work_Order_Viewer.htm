  <h1>Work Order Viewer     </h1>
  <h2>Purpose:  </h2>
  <p class="Reference_Line" style="margin-bottom: 0.00pt;">View, modify and bill Work Orders.</p>
  <h2>Usage:</h2>
  <p>The <a href="New_Call_Viewer.htm">New Call</a> viewer is typically used to create new service dispatches; they may also be generated from TechAnywhere. Refer to the <a href="Client_Site_Equipment_PM_Tab.htm">Client Site Equipment PM Schedule</a> or <a href="PM_Master_Schedule_Master_Contract_.htm">Master Contract</a> for details on generating Preventive Maintenance Work Orders. Work Orders may also be created from <a href="Quotemaster_Viewer.htm">Quotemaster</a>.</p>
  <p style="margin-left: 48px;">
    <font style="font-weight: bold;">Credit Hold</font>
    <font style="font-weight: bold;">Work</font>
    <font style="font-weight: bold;">Orders</font><br/>
    Users are not allowed to directly add labor, inventory or other items to Credit Hold work orders. A credit manager must first clear the Credit Hold box and save the work order.
  </p>
  <p style="margin-left: 48px;"><span style="font-weight: bold;">Closing Call Script / Additional Service Recommendations Wizard</span><br/>
    When the Escalation Status is set to Completed, a wizard is invoked if the Closing Call Script is completed. The wizard also lets you add Service Recommendations (unless prevented by registry) that are saved as Site notes. See <a href="Service_Recommendations.htm">Service Recommendations</a>.</p>
  <p class="Reference_Line" style="margin-left: 36.00pt; margin-bottom: 0.00pt;">
    <font style="font-weight: bold;">Service Evaluation Wizard</font><br/>
    The Service Evaluation Wizard will be launched when a work order that references a Service Evaluation table is completed or invoiced. Your responses will be written to the Evaluation tab.
  </p>
  <p class="Reference_Line" style="margin-left: 36.00pt; margin-bottom: 0.00pt;">
    <font style="font-weight: bold;">PM Work Orders</font><br/>
    If the Invoice Id on an imported line matches the PM Invoice Id on the WO,  it can be marked as extra and billed.
  </p>
  <p style="margin-left: 36.00pt;">
    <font style="font-weight: bold;">Work Order Detail Lines</font><br/>
    Edits made to detail lines AFTER a change has been made to the Posting Type of the Cost Category update job history using the <font style="text-decoration: underline; ">original Cost Type.</font>
  </p>
  <p style="margin-left: 36.00pt;">
    <font style="font-weight: bold;">Foreign Currency Processing</font><br/>
    If foreign currency processing is implemented on your system (and this WO is for a foreign customer), all Revenue amounts must be entered in terms of your customer’s currency.
  </p>
  <p style="margin-left: 36.00pt;">
    <font style="font-weight: bold;">Lines Imported from Quotemaster</font><br/>
    The ‘Imported from Quote’ fields on detail lines is checked if the line was imported. A registry entry (see link to Work Order Options) denies changes to imported lines.
  </p>
  <p style="margin-left: 36.00pt;">
    <font style="font-weight: bold;">Warn user if WO is assigned to a TechAnywhere Tech</font><br/>
    Unless disabled by <a href="Registry_Entry_to_Warn_if_Cost_Code_Requires_Certified_PR_Reporting.htm#h">Disable Remote Tech Warning</a>, the message “WARNING: this work order has open assignments to remote technicians”  appears if any uncompleted tech lines are assigned to a remote tech.
  </p>

  <h2>Important Buttons:</h2>
  <p><span><img alt="" border="0" src="assets/images/SKIN1_ViewReports.bmp" style="border: none;"/> The View Reports button on the sidebar of the Work Order allow users to select from a list of appropriate reports when enabled via <a href="Registry_Work_Order_View_Report_Button.htm">registry</a>.</span></p>
  <p><img align="left" alt="" border="0" src="assets/images/SKIN1_ImportCosts.bmp" style="border: none;"/>Clicking the Get Costs button imports PO, Job Journal, Labor Journal and Requisitioned costs/items to this work order so that they can be billed with the service invoice functionality. <span>See <a href="Registry_Entry_to_Warn_if_Cost_Code_Requires_Certified_PR_Reporting.htm#Consolidate_Imported_Job_History_Records">Consolidate Imported Lines</a> for a registry to consolidate imported lines if possible.</span></p>
  <p><span>Get Costs works differently depending on whether or not the Work Order has been quoted. The decision as to whether or not a WO has been quoted looks for Quote Scope records with a status of Accepted or Approved.  It also restricts the list to only those Scopes that are for the WO currently in the viewer.  </span></p>
  <p style="margin-left: 48px;"><span style="font-weight: bold;">I</span><span style="font-weight: bold;">mporting Costs if the Work Order has been Quoted</span><br/>
    Costs will be imported at $0 Revenue to avoid double-billing.<br/>
    The user will not be asked about importing Revenue Adjustments to avoid changing any special adjustments from the Quote.</p>
  <p style="margin-left: 48px;"><span style="font-weight: bold;">Importing Costs if the Work Order has NOT been Quoted</span><br/>
    A <a href="Registry_Entry_to_Warn_if_Cost_Code_Requires_Certified_PR_Reporting.htm#Prompt_for_Importing_Revenue_Adjustments">Registry</a> may be implemented to prompt the user if they wish to import revenue adjustments when importing costs to a Work Order that is <span style="font-weight: bold;">not</span> associated with a Quote. If the user clicks Yes (to import revenue adjustments), it will have the same result as clicking the Adjust Revenue button on the Gross Margin tab.</p>
  <p>If this job is not marked ‘Service Compute’ users may adjust these imported lines. However, this job must be recomputed (in Record Billing Adjustments) before it can be invoiced. This functionality includes labor lines that have hours but zero cost and zero revenue.</p>
  <p><span>Lines imported from Job History will always retain their Job information even when the DefaultJobByEquipmentId registry is enabled.</span></p>
  <p style="margin-left: 36.00pt;">
    <font style="font-weight: bold;">Import Costs Wizard</font><br/>
    An Import Costs wizard will appear when Get Costs is clicked if it has been implemented via registry: see <a href="Import_Cost_Wizard.htm">Import Cost Wizard</a> for details. This functionality is required if you are using Material Requisitioning.
  </p>
  <p style="margin-left: 36.00pt;">
    <font style="font-weight: bold;">Setting the Equipment Id on Imported Lines:</font><br/>
    When a PO is created for a Work Order, an Equipment Id might not be specified on it. When the PO is imported the system sets the Equipment Id as follows:
  </p>
  <p style="margin-left: 72.00pt;">- If a work order has only one piece of equipment, it will default when a PO is imported.  <br/>
    - If a work order has more than one piece of equipment, the equipment id is NOT set on the import, but you may edit the detail line and select the equipment; it will be recorded in JC history and appear on the Revenues tab when the WO is saved.</p>
  
  <p><img alt="image\SKIN1_Import_Flat_Rate.gif" border="0" height="35" src="assets/images/image/SKIN1_Import_Flat_Rate.gif" title="image\SKIN1_Import_Flat_Rate.gif" width="63"/> Use to import a Flat Rate Category. Click <a href="Import_Flat_Rate_into_Work_Order.htm">Importing a Flat Rate</a>. for details. If a Flat Rate is imported with Required Resource/Material Requisitioning processing enabled, the Date on the Flat Import window will set the Date Required on the Required Resource tab. If an inventory item is on the flat rate, the Description is set from the Inventory Item Name. </p>
  <p><img alt="image\SKIN1_CreatePO.gif" border="0" height="28" src="assets/images/image/SKIN1_CreatePO.gif" title="image\SKIN1_CreatePO.gif" width="94"/>  The Create PO button launches the Purchase Order viewer with this WO&#39;s Id filled in. The user is prevented from creating a PO with this button if the header Job is closed unless this is a PM Work Order (Type = PreventiveMaint): the user is then warned that the job was closed as of a certain date, but is allowed to continue and create the Purchase Order.</p>
  <p><img alt="" border="0" src="assets/images/image/SKIN1_CreateQuote.gif" style="border: none;"/>  Click this button to launch the Quote <span>Manager</span> viewer. The Work Order Id and all other corresponding defaults will be filled in.</p>
  <p><img alt="image\SKIN1_MaterialReq.gif" border="0" height="28" src="assets/images/image/SKIN1_MaterialReq.gif" title="image\SKIN1_MaterialReq.gif" width="94"/>  If Material Requisitioning is enabled, clicking this button launches the Required Resource Wizard to create PO’s for non-inventory items on the Required Resource tab; Inventory items will also be included if a Vendor Id is specified.  Complete both the Vendor and Location fields in the Wizard viewer so the PO will be correctly configured. The Start Material Requisitioning function must be used to generate Stock Transfer Orders for Inventory Lines that do not specify a Vendor.</p>
  <p><img alt="image\SKIN1_AddCallScript.gif" border="0" height="28" src="assets/images/image/SKIN1_AddCallScript.gif" title="image\SKIN1_AddCallScript.gif" width="94"/>  When you click the Add Call Script button, the system will prompt you to enter a Call Script Id and Equipment Id. When you do so, and click OK, the system will insert the questions from the selected Call Script to the Call Script Tab. Enter the answers to this Call Script on the Call Script tab.</p>
  <p><img alt="image\SKIN1_ServiceRecs.gif" border="0" height="28" src="assets/images/image/SKIN1_ServiceRecs.gif" title="image\SKIN1_ServiceRecs.gif" width="94"/>  The Service Recommendation button enables you to view / enter Service Recommendation Notes for the Client Site associated with this Work Order. See <a href="Service_Recommendations.htm">Service Recommendations</a> for details.</p>
  <p class="Reference_Line" style="margin-bottom: 0.00pt;"><img alt="image\SKIN1_Printer.gif" border="0" height="28" src="assets/images/image/SKIN1_Printer.gif" title="image\SKIN1_Printer.gif" width="94"/> Click this button to print the selected  work order. By default, the Report Work Order list viewer will be launched with the Print WO Notes box checked. A different report may be specified via the <a href="Registry_Entry_for_Report_and_Function_Substitution.htm">Registry Report and Function Substitution (sys-function-substitutions)</a>  setting.</p>
  <p class="Reference_Line" style="margin-bottom: 0.00pt;"><img alt="image\SKIN1_SE.gif" border="0" height="28" src="assets/images/image/SKIN1_SE.gif" title="image\SKIN1_SE.gif" width="94"/> Click this button to view or maintain the scheduled events for this Work Order. If you then click New, a new event form (with the Source Type, Rn, Id and Description defaulted in) will be displayed, allowing for easy &quot;one off&quot; creation of a scheduled event for this Work Order.</p>

      This feature is implemented in conjunction with the Quote / Quote Manger
      and the Quote boxes on the Inventory, Labor and Other lines. If a
      <font style="font-weight: bold; font-style: italic;">line</font> is
      flagged as a Quote and the Invoice Ready box is blank, no job history
      will be written for this line (however, this information will be available
      for reporting purposes). When the Quote is approved, you would complete
      the work, and then add lines for the cost of the actual work completed
      that are not checked as quotes (the billable quantity should be zero).
      When the work order is saved as invoice ready, the following entries
      will be made:
    </p>
    <p style="margin-left: 128px;">Costs for lines flagged as Quotes will
      be written to Job History as budgeted costs.<br/>
      Revenue for lines flagged as Quotes will be written to Job History
      as billable revenue.<br/>
      Costs for lines that are not flagged as quotes will be written to Job
      History</p>

  <p>Click this button when all charges have been added and this work order is ready to invoice. Doing so checks the Ready to Invoice box that controls whether the Work Order can be billed. When you compute an invoice from the Work Order, the system will check Job History to prevent the bill-thru date from preceding the Job&#39;s previous bill-thru date. The Billing Agent Id will be set to the User’s Id.</p>
  <p>If Required Resources are listed on this Work Order you will be warned if there are any lines haven&#39;t yet been requisitioned. This behavior may be altered via registry entry to display an error message and prevent the status change.</p>
  <p>On the Technician tab, the status of all lines currently set to Completed, Invoice Review, or Invoice Approved will be changed to Invoice Ready. By default, the user will also be warned if some technician lines are not set to &#39;&#39;Completed&#39;&#39;, &#39;&#39;Invoice Review&#39;&#39;, or  &#39;&#39;InvoiceApproved&quot; when a work order is flagged as invoice ready.

It is designed to support certain special sales tax considerations. It applies only to work orders whose default Job is flagged as Service Compute. In addition, a registry entry enabling its use must be implemented. If both of these requirements are met, clicking this button (after saving any changes to this work order) does the following:</p>
  <p style="margin-left: 36.00pt;">1.  Deletes all existing WO Sales Tax lines that haven&#39;t been invoiced yet.<br/>
    2.  Computes and auto-generates new lines on the Sales Tax tab.</p>

  <p><img alt="image\resetTaxStatusJCH.gif" border="0" height="28" src="assets/images/image/resetTaxStatusJCH.gif" title="image\resetTaxStatusJCH.gif" width="94"/> Pressing this button reviews Job History lines and set all lines for this work order that do NOT have an AR Invoice ID or are of Tax Type Use to &#39; n/a&#39; (space n/a) so that they will be successfully re-evaluated at invoice time if the Job’s Tax Status or Tax Group has been changed. This button also changes all applicable lines within the Work Order viewer itself to a tax type of &#39; n/a&#39;.</p>
  <p>
    <font style="font-weight: bold;">Date Work Completed:</font><br/>
    This field will be automatically set by the system when the work order is completed. A Work Order is considered ‘completed’ if the WO Escalation Status is set to Completed or Invoice Ready.
  </p>
  <p>By default, the date will correspond to the most recent date on the Technician tab.

  </p>
  <p>
    <font style="font-weight: bold;">Invoice Number:</font><br/>
    The most recent invoice number used to bill for this Work Order will appear in this field when the invoice is posted to AR.
  </p>
  <p>
    <font style="font-weight: bold;">Payment Type:</font><br/>
    This field is typically used to define how the client says they will pay (e.g., Cash, Check, Account, Credit Card, etc.).
  </p>
  <p>
    <font style="font-weight: bold;">Job Terms Id:</font>
    <font style="font-weight: bold;">COD:</font><br/>

  <p>
    <font style="font-weight: bold;">Override</font>
    <font style="font-weight: bold;">Terms Id:</font>
    <font style="font-weight: bold;">COD:</font><br/>
    If enabled by registry, this field may be used to override the AR Terms Code in the WO header Job.(displayed as Job Terms Id). Typically, this field would be set to if an underpayment was received on a COD work order. It may also be necessary to override a generic COD Client; see Override Client Id below.
  </p>
  <p>
    <font style="font-weight: bold;">Price Code</font><br/>
    If this display-only field defaults from the Client Site record, standard unit pricing for inventory items will be overridden by the Price Code referenced in the client site. This is applicable for Inventory Items marked as Use Unit Pricing. Price codes are referenced in the Inventory Item Pricing tab and in the Client Site record.
  </p>
  <p><span style="font-weight: bold;">
      <font style="font-weight: bold;">S</font>ite Price Level
    </span><span><br/>
      This field comes from the Client Site record and provides the default value for the Inventory tab for items marked as Use Unit Pricing unless overridden by the Job&#39;s Price Level. If neither the Site not the Job have the Price Level set, it will be defaulted to &#39;1&#39; when these Inventory Items are entered on the Inventory tab. </span></p>
  <p>
    <font style="font-weight: bold;">PM Invoice Number:</font><br/>
    If the work order is an auto-generated PM work order then the last invoice number for the same PM job will be displayed here. The purpose is to make any cost charged to the PM work order get posted as billed therefore removing them from the unbilled cost report.
  </p>
  <p style="margin-left: 36.00pt;">
    <font style="font-weight: bold;">Service Compute Invoicing of Extras on PM WO’s:</font> The system allows lines flagged as Extras that are manually entered, as well as imported from PO’s to be billed on PM WO’s even if the Work Order’s PM Invoice Id is set. If the invoice id on the imported line matches the PM Invoice Id on the Work Order, these lines can be marked as extra and billed.
  </p>
  <p>
    <font style="font-weight: bold;">Next Invoice Id:</font><br/>
    If you mark a work order as Invoice Ready and say OK to the compute, this will display the invoice number that will be used if you printed the invoice right now.
  </p>
  <p>
    <font style="font-weight: bold;">WO Next Invoice Total:</font><br/>
    If you mark a work order as Invoice Ready and say OK to the compute, this will display the computed total for the Job specified in the Work Order. It is used as a check to be sure the compute didn&#39;t find unbilled costs from a different work order charged to the same job.
  </p>
  <p>
    <font style="font-weight: bold;">Invoice Status:</font><br/>
    Shows the current invoice status of the Job referenced in this Work Order.
  </p>
  <p>
    <font style="font-weight: bold;">Job Client Id:</font><br/>
    This display-only field defaults from the WO header Job.
  </p>
  <p>
    <font style="font-weight: bold;">Override</font>
    <font style="font-weight: bold;">Client Id:</font><br/>
    If enabled by registry, this field may be used to override the Client in the WO header Job.(displayed as Job Client Id). Typically, this would be used if a Work Order for a COD Job (referencing a generic COD client) has receivables or overages, and must therefore be linked to an actual Client record for tracking AR. When the Work Order is invoiced, the AR Sales and Cash Receipts (if applicable) entries generated will reference the Override Client.

    During Service Invoice printing, if this field is completed, the system will use the address in this record instead of the Job Record’s Billing Address Id (if completed) or the Job Invoice Address and Email fields. Also note that e-mail address in the Billing Address record will be used for the auto-emailing of invoices (if enabled).

    <font style="font-weight: bold;">Escalation Status:</font><br/>
    Display only. The Escalation Status of a work order as a whole is set based on the individual technician statuses (on the Technician tab) as well as the type of Work Order it is. The one exception to this is the case of Credit Hold work orders, which overrides the normal Escalation Status processing. The Escalation Status is used by the Scheduled Event Manager when determining if Scheduled Events (Alarms and Notifications) should be executed or canceled. This field may also be used for reporting purposes. Click <a href="Escalation_Status.htm">Escalation Status</a> for a detailed description of how this field is set.
  </p>
  <p style="margin-left: 48px;"><span style="font-weight: bold;">Cancelled Status:</span> Note that setting the Tech Status to Cancelled will also set the Tech&#39;s Scheduled Events to Cancelled if they have not yet been executed. If the Work Order Escalation status is also set to Cancelled unexecuted Scheduled Events that are not tech-based will also be set to Cancelled.</p>

  </p>
  <p>
    <font style="font-weight: bold;">Work Order Status Category:</font><br/>
    This display only field is set by the system. It is used in conjunction with the SAM Pro.net components to determine if a work order should be displayed on a SAMPro.net component (e.g., CRMAnywhere, TechAnywhere, etc.).
  </p>

  <p class="Reference_Line" style="margin-bottom: 0.00pt;">
    <font style="font-weight: bold;">Credit Hold</font><br/>
    This field is set (during New Call or when the Create PM Workorder function is run) if any receivables exceed the number of Credit Hold Days for the Client referenced in the Job record. If a work order is placed on credit hold, it will not be visible on the dispatch board, and cannot be changed except by credit managers.
  </p>
  <p>To release the work order from Credit Hold, the credit manager should clear the Credit Hold box by double-clicking on it, and then click the Save button. When he or she has done so, the manager’s user Id will be displayed. Once the work order has been released, it will be visible on the dispatch board, and can be updated and assigned according to your firm’s usual procedures.</p>
  <p>
    <font style="font-weight: bold;">Closing Call Script:</font><br/>
    This field specifies the Call Script that should be invoked when a Dispatcher closes a Work Order. This field defaults from the Client Site record for Work Orders that were created in New Call.
  </p>
  <p>
    <font style="font-weight: bold;">Call Script Loaded?</font><br/>
    This box is automatically checked by the system when the closing call script is run so that it will not be run a second time if the work order goes though changes resulting in it being completed a second time. It may be cleared by the user if for some reason it should be rerun.
  </p>
  <p><span style="font-weight: bold;">TechAnywhere Source Rn: Technician Id:</span><br/>

	 border-right: 1.50pt solid #000000;"><a name="Work_Order_COD_Tab" id="Work_Order_COD_Tab"></a>COD Tab</p>
  <p>Entries on this tab should ONLY be made for COD work orders, NEVER for billable work orders. The system will warn the user when any field is changed on the COD parent tab and the Work Order&#39;s terms are not COD.</p>
  <p>When a COD Work Order is processed from SAM Pro, you must print and post the invoice to have the appropriate journal entries generated (Cash Receipts and Sales Journal, or just Sales Journal if enabled by registry). If only the AR Sales Journal is written, it will automatically be written by the system crediting the applicable sales account and debiting the GL Account specified on this tab for the payment received.</p>
  <p>The following should be set up correctly in order for entries on this tab to be processed correctly:</p>
  <p style="margin-left: 36.00pt;">- The Work Order’s Job should reference an AR Terms record that is correctly configured for COD’s.</p>
  <p style="margin-left: 36.00pt;">- The COD box in this AR Terms record must be checked (note that this field is displayed below).</p>
  <p style="margin-left: 36.00pt;">- The AR Terms Id defaults from the Job <font style="font-style: italic;">when the Work Order is</font>
    <font style="font-style: italic;">loaded</font>, so the Job’s AR Terms record must be set correctly from the beginning.
  </p>
  <p style="margin-left: 72.00pt;">
    <font style="font-weight: bold;">TechAnywhere</font>
    <font style="font-weight: bold;">COD’s:</font><br/>
    For COD Invoices generated from TechAnywhere, the appropriate AR Sales AND Cash Receipts entries can be generated when the TechAnywhere Post is run. In addition, a copy of the Invoice the Tech printed for the customer will be downloaded from TechAnywhere and attached to the Work Order (but not the Client).

  <p>
    <font style="font-weight: bold;">GL Account Id:</font><br/>
    Enter the GL Account that is to be debited for the COD payment received. <font style="font-weight: bold;">Note that field should NEVER be completed for a billable work order because doing so triggers the COD processing.</font>
  </p>
  <p style="margin-left: 36.00pt;">
    <font style="font-weight: bold;">Sweep Accounts:</font> The Bank Deposits Journal reads cash receipts that are generated from the COD tab within the Work Order.  If your firm uses Bank Reconciliation processing, the GL Account referenced on the COD tab should be the sweep account. If your firm maintains different sweep accounts for different credit cards, be sure to select the correct one.
  </p>
  <p style="margin-left: 36.00pt;">
    <font style="font-weight: bold;">TIP:</font> If this account was entered incorrectly on the work order, it may be corrected in the AR Sales Journal entry that it generated (on the GL tab’s AR Cash Receipts Account number) provided that it has not been recorded in the Bank Deposit Journal: the user should manually verify that nothing has been deposited before making any changes
  </p>
  <p>
    <font style="font-weight: bold;">GL Entity Id:</font><br/>
    Enter the GL Entity that should be debited for the payment received.
  </p>
  <p>
    <font style="font-weight: bold;">Payment Type Id:</font><br/>
    Enables the user to record the exact type of COD payment (e.g.,, cash, check, credit card, etc.). A payment type of “none” is useful for estimates and no charges.
  </p>
  <p style="margin-left: 36.00pt;">
    <font style="font-weight: bold;">Note:</font> The system will default the COD GL Account Id from the Payment Type record when the Payment Id is changed or entered. When the selected Payment Type record includes a default GL Account, do not permit changes to the COD GL Account Id.
  </p>
  <p>
    <font style="font-weight: bold;">AR Terms Id: COD?</font><br/>
    The display-only AR Terms Id defaults from the Work Order’s Job record, and should be set to an appropriated record for COD jobs (with the COD? box (from the AR Terms record) checked.

    <font style="font-weight: bold;">Tip: Fixing a COD Work Order with a Bad P</font>
    <font style="font-weight: bold;">ayment</font>
  </p>
  <p style="margin-left: 36.00pt;">By default a COD posts a &quot;Cash Receipt&quot; as well as an AR Sales Entry. To be able to use &quot;Reverse Invoice&quot; for invoices handled in this manner, the &#39;COD&#39; Cash Receipt posting must first be reversed as follows:</p>
  <p style="margin-left: 36.00pt;">To find Cash Receipt for COD invoice...</p>
  <p style="margin-left: 66.25pt;">Go to VIEW INVOICE MASTER - click on Child Tab: &#39;Trx History&#39; &amp; note the TRXid # for the source &#39;AR Receipt&#39; (fyi-COD parent tab will show the payment info).</p>
  <p style="margin-left: 36.00pt;">To remove the Cash Receipt, go to Cash Receipts...</p>
  <p style="margin-left: 66.25pt;">1) Filter on TRXid # from step above</p>
  <p style="margin-left: 66.25pt;">2) Change the Received Amount to 0</p>
  <p style="margin-left: 66.25pt;">3) Delete off the lines</p>
  <p style="margin-left: 66.25pt;">4) Save the entry</p>
  <p style="margin-left: 36.00pt;">You should now be able to reverse the invoice (providing it had not been &#39;deposited&#39;.</p>
  <p style="margin-left: 36.00pt;">
    <font style="font-weight: bold;">Process if the registry is enabled to suppress the Cash Receipt</font>
  </p>
  <p style="margin-left: 36.00pt;">When a COD Work Order is saved, a Sales Journal will automatically be written by the system, crediting the applicable sales account and debiting the GL Account specified on this tab for the payment received. If it turns out this was a bad payment (e.g, NSF check), you may use the following procedure to account for this situation.</p>
  <p style="margin-left: 36.00pt;">1) If the check was deposited, you may or may not want to remove it from the deposit journal. If you do, the check will become available for deposit forever into the future.</p>
  <p style="margin-left: 36.00pt;">2) You will need to manually create a <font style="text-decoration: underline; ">new</font> AR Sales Journal entry to ‘reverse’ the effect of the cash receipts portion of the entry generated by the system.</p>
  <p style="margin-left: 36.00pt; text-indent: 30.25pt;">In the AR Sales Journal Header:</p>
  <p style="margin-left: 102.25pt;">- Enter the Client Id of the customer who made the bad payment</p>
  <p style="margin-left: 102.25pt;">- Reference the original Invoice Id, but add NSF (or other initials) to the original Id to notify that this was from non-sufficient funds.</p>
  <p style="margin-left: 102.25pt;">- Specify a current accounting period and if possible match the invoice date from the original invoice for aging.</p>
  <p style="margin-left: 66.25pt;">On the AR Sales Prices Tab</p>
  <p style="margin-left: 102.25pt;">- On the Prices tab, enter the amount of the invoice and the GL account used for the bank checking account (if you did not reverse the deposit journal) or use the Sweep account (if you did reverse the deposit.)</p>
  <p style="margin-left: 36.00pt;">3) Save your AR Sales Journal Entry.</p>

  <p>This tab displays the invoices generated from this work order, including zero-dollar invoices. By default, only Service Compute type invoices are shown.  See <a href="Registry_Entry_to_Warn_if_Cost_Code_Requires_Certified_PR_Reporting.htm#registry_workorder_Show_RININV4_Invoices">Registry to Display RININV4 Invoices</a> if Service Compute invoices are NOT used on your system and you would like to display RININV4 invoices on this tab.</p>

  <p>This tab displays purchase orders associated with this work order. Double-click on a line to access the Purchase Order.</p>
  <p>PO Id - Description - Qty Ordered - U-M - Unit Cost - Amount - Qty Received - Qty Vouchered - Vendor - Type - Promised - Confirming - PO Status</p>
  <p>The Inventory Item Id is included in the Description field (ItemId~Description) to avoid confusion if a General and Inventory Item have the same Description.</p>
  <p>Released, &#39;shell&#39; PO&#39;s (with no detail lines) are displayed on the Purchases tab with the Description set to &#39; Purchases Not Itemized&#39;.  </p>
  <p>By default, Unreleased PO&#39;s do not appear on this tab unless enabled via registry; see <a href="Registry_Entry_to_Warn_if_Cost_Code_Requires_Certified_PR_Reporting.htm">Registry Work Order</a>. Since Unreleased PO&#39;s do NOT post to IM History, Unreleased PO line details will NOT be shown.  The user will see a single line identifying basic PO information, with &#39; Purchases Not Itemized - in the Description. The Status column will indicate that the Purchase Order is Unreleased.</p>
  <p>For Credit PO&#39;s, the Purchase tab shows zero received if the item has not been received, or the applicable negative number if it has been received.</p>
  <p>The Confirming column is set to Yes if the PO’s Confirming? box is checked, or No if it is clear. This column allows for easy communication between the parts manager and the service department. If a PO is flagged as Confirming, it indicates that the parts manager has already delivered the PO to the vendor. If it is not flagged as Confirming, this operation needs to be completed.</p>

  <p>The display tab lists all Quotes associated with this Work Order. The Scope of Work, Equipment and Price, and Status are displayed for each option on the Quote.</p>
  <p><span style="font-weight: bold;">Scope WO:</span><br/>
    The Scope WO column displays the Work Order Id from the specified Quote Scope option. This column will only be completed when the approval wizard has been successfully run for that option. If the selected Work Order was only used as the source Work Order in the Quote, a different Scope WO (generated by the Approval Wizard) may be referenced in this column.</p>

  <p>The Escalation Tab provides a synopsis of the Scheduled Events associate with this Work Order. You may click on a column heading to sort the information by this column in ascending order. Clicking on the column again will sort in descending order.</p>
  <p>
    <font style="font-weight: bold;">Scheduled:</font><br/>
    This column lists the scheduled date and time of the event determined by the escalation manager.
  </p>
  <p>If the Status field is set to Executed and Scheduled Column is set to 1900-01-01 00:00:00, the event was executed immediately (such as when the system plays ‘catch up’ when a new tech is added to the work order, and escalations that had been sent to the first tech are repeated to the new tech). The new Created column lists the date and time the event was created and executed.</p>
  <p>
    <font style="font-weight: bold;">Created:</font><br/>
    This column lists date and time the scheduled event was created. It also provides the execution date for events that were executed immediately upon creation.

  <p>This tab must be enabled via <a href="Registry_Start_Taylor_Universal_Work_Order_Generation.htm">Registry</a> and is used for the Taylor Universal Work Order functionality. See <a href="Taylor_Universal_Work_Order_Setup.htm">Taylor Universal Work Order Setup</a> for additional details.</p>
  <p>The following validations will only be performed if the Work Order is flagged as a UWO Work Order by setting the WO Type field on the UWO tab. Note also that, consistent with other UWO validations, these validations are performed only when the Save Record is attempted.</p>
  <p style="margin-left: 48px;">The system does not allow a Work Order to be saved if the “Recall Due To” field on the UWO tab is other than “N/A”  but the “Work Order Type” field on the Main tab is other than “Call Back” (i.e. the Work Order is not a Recall).</p>
  <p style="margin-left: 48px;">The system does not allow a Work Order to be saved if the &quot;Rewrite Parts Received&quot; field on the UOW tab is other than &quot;N/A&quot; but the &quot;Original WO&quot; field on the Main tab is blank (i.e. the Work Order is not a Rewrite).</p>
  <p style="margin-left: 48px;">The system does not allow a Work Order to be flagged as both a Rewrite and a Recall.</p>
