  <h1>Common Phrases</h1>
  <h2>Purpose:</h2>
  <p>This viewer enables you to enter the text of phrases that your firm commonly uses in scrolling text boxes. You may then insert this text into a text box by entering the Common Phrase Id and then immediately pressing the Enter key.</p>
  <p>Common phrases support of the use of token variables. In addition to text that you enter, you may also specify variables in order to include information such as the Work Order Id, Client Site Name, etc., in the Common Phrase. This feature is especially useful for emailing messages from the dispatch board.</p>
  <h2>Usage:</h2>
  <p>This feature is implemented in scrolling text boxes such as the Work Performed (in the Work Order), the Job Invoice Description (in the Job Record and Record Billing Adjustments), the Purchase Order Extended Description, and the e-mail functionality accessed from the Dispatch Board. Common Phrases are NOT currently supported in Notes.</p>
  <p>In TechAnywhere, there are 3 TechAnywhere fields that can use common phrases: Work Performed, Recommendations and Quotes.</p>
  <p>Common phrases are subject to the security level of the user. This means that keying in a Common Phrase Id that is not &#39;part&#39; of a user&#39;s security id results in no auto-loading of the Common Phrase&#39;s Text value.  To this user it will appear as though the common phrase doesn&#39;t exist. Common phrases created by global users (with no Security Id) will be available to all users.</p>
  <h3>Registry:</h3>
  <p><span>A Common Phrase may be referenced via registry to <a href="Registry_Entry_Report_Service_Invoice.htm#Customize_Service_Invoice_Email_Message">Customize Service Invoice Email Messages</a>.</span></p>
  <h2>Important Fields:</h2>
  <p>
    <font style="font-weight: bold;">Common Phrase Id:</font><br/>
    This must uniquely identify the phrase. This viewer does not allow a leading or embedded blank character in the Id.
  </p>
  <p>
    <font style="font-weight: bold;">Common Phrase Description:</font><br/>
    Briefly describes this phrase.
  </p>
  <p>
    <font style="font-weight: bold;">Text:</font><br/>
    This is the actual text that is to be inserted into a scrolling text box. 1200 characters are allowed.
  </p>
  <p>
    <font style="font-weight: bold;">Example:</font><br/>
    Suppose you create a Common Phrase as follows
  </p>
  <p>
    <font style="font-weight: bold;">Id:</font> 001 <font style="font-weight: bold;">Name:</font> Analysis
  </p>
  <p>
    <font style="font-weight: bold;">Text:</font> The system was analyzed and the following results were obtained:
  </p>
  <p>With the cursor in the Work Performed field of the Work Order Equipment tab, you would type 001 and then press the Enter key. Doing so would insert the text</p>
  <p>The system was analyzed and the following results were obtained:</p>
  <p>Since the caret will appear at the end of this phrase, you can then continue typing the actual results you found (or enter another Common Phrase that described a typical result).</p>
  <p>Token Variables:</p>
  <p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">^fieldname^  </p>
  <p>where fieldname is replaced by the Data-Basics fieldname that appears when you position the cursor over a field. Each variable must be preceded <font style="text-decoration: underline; ">and</font> followed by the caret ^ symbol. If the system recognizes the token field depends upon what record you are in. For example, you used a common phrase with the token ^clntste_nme^ for the Dispatch Board e-mail, the system would understand the token and replace ^clntste_nme^ with, for example, Acme #001, it that was the name of the client site associated with that dispatch. If you used the same common phrase in, say, the Vendor record, the system would not understand what the variable mean, and simply display the text ^clntste_nme^.</p>
  <p>
    <font style="font-weight: bold;">Variable   Result</font><br/>
    ^wrkordr_id^   Displays the Work Order Id<br/>
    ^wrkrordr_nme^  Displays the Work Order Name<br/>
    ^clntste_id^  Displays the Client Site Id<br/>
    ^clntste_nme^  Displays the Client Site Name<br/>
    ^clnsteeqpmnt_id^ Displays the Equipment Id
  </p>
  <p>Special Tokens:</p>
  <p>
    <font style="font-weight: bold;">^date^ ^time^ ^usr_id^ ^usr_nme^</font><br/>
    This release also supports the special tokens ^date^ and ^time^. When these are included in a common phrase, the software will replace them with the current system date and time.
  </p>
  <p>^usr_id^ and ^usr_nme^ will be replaced by the Id and Name of the current user.</p>
  <p>Example:</p>
  <p>Please call the office about Work Order ^wrkordr_id^ for site “clntste_nme” : ^date^ ^time^</p>
  <p>Result:</p>
  <p>Please call the office about Work Order 100034 for site Bachelors Bagels; 04/072004 12:42:37 PM</p>
  <p>Hyperlinks:</p>
  <p><span>If the common phrase includes a url in the standard form www.mycompany.com it will appear as a link when a PDF is generated (for example, in an emailed service invoice). A Common Phrase may be referenced via registry to <a href="Registry_Entry_Report_Service_Invoice.htm#Customize_Service_Invoice_Email_Message">Customize Service Invoice Email Messages</a>.</span><span>  </span></p>
  <p>
    <font style="font-weight: bold;">Field Restrictions</font><br/>
    This field can be used to restrict the list of fields for which a specific Common Phrase is applicable in SAMPro. If this field is blank, no restrictions to Common Phrase’s use in a textbox-type field will be made. If the field is completed, the Common Phrase will only be available to the fields that it references. You may either use the database name or the SAMPro field name.  Contact your support representative for help with specific entries.
  </p>
  <p style="margin-left: 48px;"><span style="font-weight: bold;">Tip: Finding the SAMPro Field Name:</span><br/>
    Position the mouse pointer over the field you wish to restrict. Its field and database name will appear in the status pane at the bottom of the record screen.</p>
  <p>Sample Field Restriction entries:</p>
  <p style="margin-left: 36.00pt;">
    <font style="font-weight: bold;">wrkordr.wrk-rqstd</font> restricts use of the phrase to the WO Work Requested field.<br/>
    <font style="font-weight: bold;">wrkordr_wrk_rqstd</font> does the same as wrkordr.wrk-rqstd.<br/>
    <font style="font-weight: bold;">wrkordreqpmnt.wrk-rqstd</font> restricts use to the WO Equipment Work requested field.<br/>
    <font style="font-weight: bold;">*wrk-rqst</font>
    <font style="font-weight: bold;">d</font> restricts use of the phrase to any Work Requested-type field (* is used as a wildcard).
  </p>
  <p>An asterisk may be used to reference multiple fields.  For example,</p>
  <p style="margin-left: 48px;">wrkordr.wrk-prfrmd, wrkordreqpmnt.wrk-prfrmd is the equivalent of *wrk-prfrmd</p>
  <p style="margin-left: 8px;"><span style="font-weight: bold;">Remote Field Restrictions</span><br/>
    This field can be used to restrict the list of fields for which a specific Common Phrase is applicable in remote applications (currently TechAnywhere). If this field is blank, there are no restrictions to Common Phrase’s use in TechAnywhere.  In TechAnywhere, there are four TechAnywhere fields that can use common phrases: Work Performed, Work Requested (New WO only) Recommendations and Quotes.</p>
  <p>If the field is completed, the Common Phrase will only be available to the TechAnywhere fields that it references. The following fields are supported in TechAnywhere Android 3.3.051.001.<br/>
    <br/>
    TA.WP - Work Performed<br/>
    TA.WR - Work Requested (New Work Order)<br/>
    TA.Quote - Quotes<br/>
    TA.Rec - Recommendations
  </p>
  <p style="margin-left: 48px;">Example:</p>
  <p style="margin-left: 48px;"><span>To limit a Common Phrase&#39;s TechAnywhere use to Work Performed and Recommendations, you would enter the following in the Remote Field Restrictions Field:  TA.WP,TA.Rec.</span></p>
  <p>
    <font style="font-weight: bold;">Common Phrases</font>
    <font style="font-weight: bold;">User 1-5:</font><br/>
    These fields may be used by TechAnywhere assist in filtering records for TechAnywhere access, or for entering any information your company wishes to retain.
  </p>
  <p><span style="font-weight: bold;">Obsolete</span><br/>
    If the Obsolete field is flagged, the Common Phase will be ignored when invoked in text boxes in SAMPro and in remote applications (TechAnywhere).</p>
