  <h1>Accounts Payable Journal Viewer (AP Journal / AP Entry)</h1>
  <h2>Purpose:</h2>
  <p>Create/maintain the list of Accounts Payable Journal transactions. For a general overview on AP functions and procedures, click on the following topic: <a href="Accounts_Payable_Overview.htm">AP Overview</a>.</p>
  <h2>Usage:</h2>
  <p><span> When Intercompany is enabled and a detail line contains a Job Id, any changes to the line&#39;s GL Entity are validated to ensure that the new GL Entity belongs to the same company as the Job. </span></p>

  <div data-targetname="POPUP639656450">
    <p>This viewer is required to voucher AP purchases, subcontractor and
      credit memo transactions. Inventory and General items on a PO must
      have been logged as Received to be voucherable. For Subcontractor
      PO&#39;s, the Amount Earned field on the Subcontractor tab of the Purchase
      Order must be filled in.</p>
    <p><img src="assets/images/SKIN1_Receive1.bmp" alt="" style="border: none;" border="0"/>

  <div data-targetname="POPUP639707170">
    <p>The AP Journal supports accounting for both manual and system checks.
      Once a payable is vouchered, a system check may be produced via the
      Report AP Check function. If a manual check is to be written instead,
      it&#39;s number, amount, and GL Bank account should be recorded in the
      AP Journal. System validation denies the deletion of AP entries if
      a manual check or EFT has been reconciled in the Bank Reconciliation
      Journal. The AP Journal Entry for a manual check can only be deleted
      if the Accounting Period is active.</p>

  <div data-targetname="POPUP639917436">
    <p>When you make journal entries associated with a specific vendor,
      the system alerts you to the number and dollar amount of open credit
      purchase orders, if any exist for this vendor. This lets the user
      know that credit memos are expected from this vendor, and helps keep
      track of credit memos.</p>
  </div>
  <p>The journal allows postings to 0-rn GL Accounts for unvouchered payable activity if a MISC inventory group is <font style="font-weight: bold;">not</font> defined.</p>

  <p style="margin-left: 8px;">
    <font style="font-weight: bold;">Unvouchered Payables is Enabled in the Accounting Period (deprecated):</font> Since G/L entries post at the time of P.O. Receipt, it is important that the P.O. is vouchered in A/P with information that consistently reflects what the P.O. was at the time of receipt. See <a href="Unvouchered_Payables_in_Accounting_Period.htm">Unvouchered Payables in Accounting Period</a> for details.
  </p>
  <p style="margin-left: 8px;">A warning will display when a Vendor&#39;s insurance is expired (e.g., for Subcontractors).</p>
  <p style="margin-left: 48px;"><span style="font-weight: bold;">Prevent/Warn on Setting Bank GL Account if Vendor Has Expired Insurance/Blocked Payments.</span><br/>
    A <a href="Registry_Entry_AP_Journal.htm#Prevent_Warn_Setting_Bank_GL_Account_Expired_Insurance_Blocked_Payments">registry</a> may be enabled make sure the user is not allowed to use manual checks/EFT/Credit cards and set the Bank GL Account to be able to pay a vendor with expired insurance that is blocking payments. This closes a &#39;back door&#39; that allowed the payment of blocked vendors.</p>
  <h3>Receipts</h3>
  <p>Receipts (received to the PO or the Inventory Receipts journal) post to Job History. Unless this is for a PWP vendor, these costs can be billed <font style="font-style: italic;">before</font> you receive the vendor’s invoice. Only lines not previously recorded in Job History (e.g., freight adjustments) will be written to Job History when the Vendor’s invoice is vouchered.</p>
  <h3>Recording Vendor Use Tax</h3>
  <p>If the <span style="font-weight: bold;">Tax Group Id</span> on the Main tab is not completed, the following procedure may be used in the AP Journal to record Use Tax on a vendor, supplier, subcontractor invoice that did not charge sales tax:  </p>
  <p style="margin-left: 36.00pt;">Enter the sales tax on the GENERAL tab line.  Cost can be expensed to the job/work order.<br/>
    Enter a negative sales tax on the GENERAL tab line to the GL liability account for sales tax.</p>
  <p>The net result of the two tax lines is zero.  One is a DR to COGS the other a negative debit (CR) to liability account for sales tax.</p>
  <h3>Editing Lines Imported from PO’s</h3>
  <p>The fields available for edit on lines imported from PO&#39;s are restricted to the Quantity, <font face="Tahoma" style="font-family: Tahoma;">GL Account, GL Entity, and Allow Discount</font> (when UVP is not enabled in the Accounting Period)<font face="Tahoma" style="font-family: Tahoma;">.  All other edits continue to require a line-copy &amp; edit (by clicking the magnifying glass on the line).</font>
  </p>
  <p>
    <font style="font-weight: bold;">If you wish to edit the cost,</font>
    <font style="font-weight: bold;">click the Magnify button</font>
    <font style="font-weight: bold;">go into Full View.</font> The editing of a field other the exceptions noted above must be done in the Full View of the line, and the system will prompt you to confirm that you do in fact wish to make the edits. The following message will be displayed:
  </p>
  <p style="margin-left: 36.00pt;">This line was imported from the Purchase Order.<br/>
    If changes must be made, they will be made to a copy of the line. Do you wish to change this line?</p>
  <p>Click Yes to display the full view of the line, then make any changes needed; they will be written to a <font style="font-style: italic;">copy</font> of the original line. When you save the record, the negative of the original line and your newly edited line will be written to history. Inventory and General lines that were <font color="#000000" face="Tahoma" style="font-family: Tahoma;">&#39;Copied for Edit&#39; cannot be deleted.</font>

  <p><a href="Registry_Entry_Currency_Adjustment.htm">Registry Entry Currency Adjustment</a></p>
  <p>If the user enters a Work Order Id on any of the detail tabs, the system will default in the first piece of Equipment on the WO Equipment tab UNLESS disabled (see <a href="Registry_Entry_Global_Settings__Column_Compression__Dispatch_Board_Rows__History_Log_Inventory_Markup.htm#global_settings_journal_equipment_id">Registry Option Global Settings - Do Not Default Equipment Id</a>).</p>

  <h2>Range Viewer:</h2>
  <p>Since multiple GL accounts are present in the ‘parent’ table of this journal, simple range filters (where you simply enter the GL Account Id) do not work for these &quot;encapsulated&quot; fields. To enable the user to filter on a specific parent GL Account, special filter ranges with the necessary SQL to filter on a specific GL Account have been added to the range filter. <a class="dropspot" data-rhwidget="DropSpot" data-target="POPUP643087844" href="#"><span data-open-text="true" data-skip-index="true">Click here for details and tips on filtering.</span><span data-close-text="true">Click here for details and tips on filtering.</span></a></p>
  <div data-targetname="POPUP643087844">
    <p>For example, when you first access the Range screen, the GL Bank
      Account range will be completed as follows:</p>
    <p style="margin-left: 36.00pt;">
      <font style="font-weight: bold;">GL
        Bank Account Id:<br/>
      </font> sql= gl_bnk_glaccnt_rn in (select glaccnt_rn from glaccnt where
      glaccnt_id like &#39;%&#39;)
    </p>
    <p>Suppose that your firm uses more than one Bank Account. To filter
      Entries for a specific GL Bank Account, simply replace the % in the
      SQL statement with the GL Bank Account Id you wish to filter on. For
      example, to filter on the GL Bank Account Id 1005, simply change the
      SQL statement in the range to:</p>
    <p style="margin-left: 36.00pt;">sql= gl_bnk_glaccnt_rn in (select
      glaccnt_rn from glaccnt where glaccnt_id like &#39;<font style="font-weight: bold;">1005</font>&#39;)</p>
    <p style="margin-left: 36.00pt;">
      <font style="font-weight: bold; text-decoration: underline; ">Tip:
        Saving Ranges</font>
    </p>
    <p>Rather than adjust the SQL statement each time you use the filter,
      you may save your settings as a range. See <a href="Filter_Button.htm#Filter_Save_Range">Save
        Filter Range</a> for details.Type your drop-down text here.</p>

  <p>
    <font style="font-weight: bold;">PO Id:</font><br/>
    If applicable, enter the Purchase Order number or double-click on this field to select from the list of PO&#39;s. If a single Inventory Receipt Journal was recorded for this PO, or if receipts were only made on the PO, the received items will be autoloaded in the AP Journal.
  </p>
  <p>If multiple Inventory Receipt Journal (IRJ) entries are present, a list will appear allowing the user to choose All or a specify IRJ entry. If the user chooses a specific Id, only the quantities received in that entry will be loaded. If items are received on both the PO and on multiple IRJ&#39;s for the same PO, All must be selected to pull in the stragglers received on the PO.</p>
  <p style="margin-left: 48px;"><span style="font-weight: bold;">Note:</span> Previously received IRJ transactions will NOT be removed from the list.  It is hoped that this limitation will be corrected in a future version.  If you select a previously selected receipt, the system will load the quantity specified on that receipt if they have not already been load.  Validation prevents the AP Quantity from exceeding the quantity received in the IRJ or PO.</p>
  <p> A PO number should not be entered if you are creating a Credit Memo.</p>
  <p><span>If multiple Inventory Receipt Journal entries are present when the user enters the PO Id, a selection box will be displayed so the user can choose All (Inventory Receipts) Ids, or a specific Inventory Receipt Id. If a specific Id is selected, only the applicable data for that transaction will be loaded. </span><span style="font-weight: bold;">Note:</span><span> If an Inventory Receipt has been previously vouchered for all items, it will not be removed from the list, but if it is selected, no items will be loaded.</span></p>
  <p style="margin-left: 36.00pt;">
    <font style="font-weight: bold;">The PO Id may not be changed on existing AP Journal entries:</font>  If the PO Id was entered in error, delete the erroneous entry and start a new one for the correct PO Id. If a check has already been cut, it must be voided before the entry can be deleted.
  </p>
  <p style="margin-left: 36.00pt;">
    <font style="font-weight: bold;">Un-receipted Lines Warning:</font> When a PO Id is entered, a warning will be displayed if the PO has any unreceipted lines.
  </p>
  <p style="margin-left: 36.00pt;">
    <font style="font-weight: bold;">Vouchers for PWP Vendors:</font> Depending upon how your <a href="Registry_Entry_AP_Journal.htm">
      <font style="font-weight: bold;">AP Journal Registry Entry</font>
    </a> is set, you may be informed if an A/R invoice exists for the WO associated with this PO. You will have the option of attaching it to the AP Journal costs. Attachments are not made to reversed AR Invoices.
  </p>
  <p>
    <font style="font-weight: bold;">Vendor Id:</font><br/>
    The Vendor to be paid. This field defaults when you enter the Purchase Order Id. The Vendor Id cannot be changed once a Purchase Order Id has been selected. The system will display a warning if you enter an inactive Vendor Id.
  </p>
  <p>
    <font style="font-weight: bold;">Invoice #:</font><br/>
    The number as it appears on the Vendor&#39;s invoice. This field is a scrolling text box: the first 10 characters will be displayed initially, but you may continue typing if your vendor uses long #&#39;s. <span>By default, the system prevents the same Vendor Invoice from being vouchered multiple times.</span>
  </p>
  <p>
    <font style="font-weight: bold;">Invoice Date:</font><br/>
    The date on the Vendor&#39;s invoice. If the AP Terms Id is filled in, the Discount Date Due, Payment Due Date and Date to Pay fields will default based on the Invoice Date and the AP Terms Id.
  </p>
  <p>
    <font style="font-weight: bold;">Invoice Total:</font><br/>
    Enter the total as it appears on the invoice.
  </p>
  <p>
    <font style="font-weight: bold;">Effective Date:</font><br/>
    This field should default to today’s date when you first open the AP Journal.  When you save this record, the system verifies that the Effective Date falls within the date range defined by the Accounting Period. If you are creating a manual check, this field is used to set the display-only Check Date field.
  </p>
  <p style="margin-left: 48px;"><span style="font-weight: bold;">Note:</span> If you view a previous A/P entry and then select New to start a new entry, the Effective Date and Accounting Period will default to the Effective Date and Accounting Period found on the previous entry viewed unless a PO is selected. <span>This may be overridden via <a href="Registry_Entry_AP_Journal.htm">AP Journal Registry</a> to always retain the values from your initial entry even when a PO is selected. </span></p>
  <p>
    <font style="font-weight: bold;">Date Received:</font><br/>
    This field may be used to record the date the Vendor Invoice was received by your company. It must be manually entered by the user: it does not default. If this field is important for reporting purposes for your firm, you may wish to make it a required field via registry. The Drill Down AP Aging report may be aged by the Vendor’s Invoice Date or by the Date Received.
  </p>
  <p>
    <font style="font-weight: bold;">Discount %</font><br/>
    The discount percentage to allow if this AP Voucher is paid by the Discount Due Date. This field defaults from the AP Terms record but can be changed by the user.
  </p>
  <p>
    <font style="font-weight: bold;">Discount Due Date:</font><br/>
    The date by which this AP voucher must be paid in order to obtain the discount. This field is calculated by the system based on the Invoice Date and the AP Terms record but may be changed by the user.
  </p>
  <p>
    <font style="font-weight: bold;">Discount:</font><br/>
    The discount amount to allow if this AP Voucher is paid by the Discount Due Date. This field is calculated by the system (based on the Discount Percent and the Invoice Total) and rounded to the nearest penny but can be changed by the user if needed. The system recomputes discounts when the &#39;No Discount&#39; flag changes. The user is permitted to make manual entry into the Discount Amount field for a Credit Memo.
  </p>
  <p>
    <font style="font-weight: bold;">Date to Pay:</font><br/>
    The date that you intend to pay this voucher. This field defaults from the Payment Date Due but may be changed by the user if you intend to pay by the Discount Date and obtain the discount. This field will be used by the system to generate the AP Date to Pay list.
  </p>
  <p>
    <font style="font-weight: bold;">Payment Due Date:</font><br/>
    The date the payment is due without obtaining a discount. The system calculates this field for you if an AP Terms type has been selected and an Invoice Date filled in.
  </p>
  <p><span>If the Discount Days in the AP Terms is not 0, the Discount Date is established first, then the “Dues Days” rule needs to be processed using that Discount Date as the basis for establishing Due Date when the Type is: “Day This Month” or “Day Next Month”. This will prevent the Due Date from preceding the Discount Date.  If the AP Terms code is configured badly, a message box will be displayed, warning the user that &quot;AP Terms Discount Days exceeds Due Days, cannot correct Due Date.&quot; when the AP Terms is selected or Invoice Date edited.</span></p>
  <p>
    <font style="font-weight: bold;">Period Id:</font><br/>
    This field is required. The Accounting Period flagged as &#39;default&#39; will default when creating a new journal entry. To select a different Accounting Period, enter an Id or double-click on this field to select from a list of active accounting period batches. The Accounting Period Name will default when an Id is selected.
  </p>
  <p><span style="font-weight: bold;">
      <font style="font-weight: bold;">L</font>ien Waiver Req&#39;d?
    </span><br/>
    This field will be checked if the PO used to generate it required Lien Waivers. See <a href="Lien_Waiver_Overview.htm">Lien Waiver Overview</a> for details.</p>
  <p>
    <font style="font-weight: bold;">AP Terms Id:</font><br/>
    This field defaults from the PO or Vendor record but may be changed by the user if needed. The Discount %, Discount, Discount Due Date, Payment Due Date and Date to Pay fields default based on the AP Terms record and the Invoice Date that you entered.
  </p>
  <p style="margin-left: 48px;"><span style="font-weight: bold;">Tip: AP Terms Setup</span><br/>
    All AP terms with discounts - such as 2%10Net30 - should be setup with the &quot;Compute Date-To-Pay From&quot; based on Discount Days instead of Due Days.  This way IF the user skips running &#39;Select Invoice for Payment&#39; and runs Cash Requirements/Print Checks instead, the Date to Pay will be equal to the Discount Due Date.</p>
  <p>
    <font style="font-weight: bold;">Account Number</font>:<br/>
    The Account Number field defaults from the Vendor record and will be printed on AP checks.
  </p>
  <p>
    <font style="font-weight: bold;">Paid to Date:</font><br/>
    This display-only field is calculated by the system based on how much you have paid the vendor on this invoice.
  </p>
  <p>
    <font style="font-weight: bold;">Retainage Total</font><br/>
    This display-only field is calculated by the system based on the Retainage amounts on the Inventory, General and Subcontractor tabs.
  </p>
  <p>
    <font style="font-weight: bold;">GL Entity:</font><br/>
    This field is ‘sticky’ and defaults from the most recent entry loaded in the viewer when you clicked ‘New’.
  </p>
  <p><span>Postings to the Bank Account specified in the AP Manual Check section ONLY use the GL Entity when InterCompany is enabled via registry. If Inter-Company is NOT enabled, the GL Entity is not used for Manual Check / EFT / CC posting and Check records.</span></p>
  <p style="margin-left: 8px;">If Intercompany Processing is implemented and if this Entity does not match the GL Entities referenced in the child tabs, the appropriate Intercompany postings to GL History will be made when this transaction is saved.</p>
  <p>If Intercompany Processing is not implemented, SAM Pro is able to validate the consistency of the GL Entities entered in the parent and lines of the AP Journal.  The validation can take the form of either an error or a warning based on the content of the registry entry discussed in <a href="Registry_Entry_AP_Journal.htm">Registry Entry AP Journal</a>.</p>
  <p>
    <font style="font-weight: bold;">Currency Id:</font>
    <font style="font-weight: bold;">Currency Factor</font><br/>
    This field defaults from the Purchase Order (if entered) or the Vendor record (if the PO Id is not completed). If this field is completed, all amounts MUST be entered in this currency.
  </p>

    <font style="font-weight: bold;">Tax Group Id</font><br/>
    This field defaults from the Purchase Order / Vendor. This field cannot be changed if it defaulted from a PO. It should only be completed if the applicable tax rules should come from the Vendor.
  </p>
  <p><img alt="" border="0" src="assets/images/resetTaxOnLines.bmp" style="border: none;"/> If the Reset Tax on lines button is enabled via <a href="Registry_Entry_AP_Journal.htm#Enable_Reset_Tax_on_Lines_Button">Registry</a>, when the Tax Group Id is changed the user will be alerted that the Reset Tax On Lines button should be pressed to review Inventory, General and Subcontractor lines that have a Tax Group Id. Click this button to automate the process of changing the Tax Group on all of the Inventory, General and Subcontractor lines, and automatically adjusting the necessary tax amount on such lines.</p>
  <p><span>Note that this functionality does NOT pertain to the AP Journal Taxes tab. The user will be alerted if any lines appear on the Taxes tab when the button is clicked; these lines must be deleted before proceeding.</span></p>
  <p><span style="font-weight: bold;">Use Tax Total:</span><br/>
    This display-only field provides a running total of the Use Tax Cost entered on the Inventory, General and Subcontractor lines, excluding lines which have been copied for edit.</p>
  <p><span>A Tax Authority only qualifies for inclusion in the allocation when EITHER of the two conditions noted below is true:</span></p>
  <p style="margin-left: 48px;">1. The APJ line&#39;s Tax Type is Use.</p>
  <p style="margin-left: 48px;"><span>2. The Group Tax Authority line&#39;s Job Cost flag is True.</span></p>

    If the Tax Group Id field is completed, clicking this button defaults in one line on the Tax Tab for each tax authority in the Tax Group. The system also defaults in the Tax Base from the Total Entered field. The exact Tax amount may be adjusted by the user if needed to match the Vendor’s invoice exactly.</p>
  <p>The user will receive an error message if the Invoice Total (entered directly by the user) does not exceed the Invoice Entered (calculated by the system from the detail lines on the Inventory, General and Subcontractor tabs.</p>
  <p>Lines generated for Tax Authorities with graduated rates will have their GL Account, and Tax Base completed so that the user can easily complete the information from the Vendor’s invoice.</p>
  <p style="font-weight: bold;">Total Entered:  Total Discountable Amount:<br/>
    <span style="font-weight: normal;">These display-only fields are calculated by the system based on the detailed information in the tabs. Note the Total Entered must equal the Invoice Total. The system now computes the discount when the Discount Due Date or Effective Date fields change. The Discount Amount is also recomputed whenever the Invoice Total changes.</span>

  <p style="margin-left: 36.00pt;"><span style="font-weight: bold;">EFT/Credit Trx Id:</span><br/>
    If you selected a payment type of EFT or CR/DB Card, this field may be used to record its unique electronic transaction or confirmation number. If you manually enter this field, please ensure a <span style="font-weight: bold;">unique ID</span> is entered for each AP transaction, otherwise entries sharing an EFT/Credit Trx Id will not populate in the Bank Reconciliation process. If this field is blank when an EFT/CR DB Card transaction is saved, it defaults from the APJ Trx Id during the add process.</p>
  <p style="margin-left: 48px;"><span>The validation on this field allows an existing AP Journal Entry have the Payment Type changed to EFT or CR/DB and have the GL Bank Account set to the appropriate value. If the user does not set the EFT Trx ID the AP Journal Trx. will be entered when the Journal Entry is saved. Validation prevents the EFT Trx ID from being changed once it has been entered and the entry saved. In addition, the transaction cannot be changed if a check has been printed and posted for it. Validation also ensures that the EFT Trx ID is not repeated for the same GL Account / GL Entity combination. </span></p>
  <p class="Reference_Line" style="margin-left: 36.00pt; margin-bottom: 0.00pt;">The following AP Journal validation rules apply to the Manual Check fields:</p>
  <p style="margin-left: 66.25pt;">1. Don&#39;t allow entry of both a Check Number and EFT/Credit Trx Id.<br/>
    2. Check Number can only be used with Payment Type &#39;Check&#39;.<br/>
    3. EFT/Credit Trx Id not allowed with Payment Type &#39;Check&#39;.<br/>
    4. Treat EFT/Credit Trx Id similar to Check Number for existing validations.</p>
  <p style="margin-left: 66.25pt;">
    <font style="font-weight: bold;">Credit PO’s:</font><br/>
    The System allows Credit PO’s to be recorded as DB/CR card transactions. This functionality might be used in the following scenario:
  </p>
  <p style="margin-left: 72.00pt;">- Purchase Order created for part for a work order.<br/>
    - Tech picks up part and pays with a credit card.<br/>
    - PO vouchered using the CC/DB Card area and specifies the GL account.<br/>
    - Part is not used and is slated for return<br/>
    - Create Credit PO for part return.<br/>
    - Voucher Credit PO using the CC/DB Card area and specify the GL account.</p>
  <p style="margin-left: 36.00pt;">
    <font style="font-weight: bold;">GL Bank Account Id:</font><br/>
    If you are recording a manual check, EFT or Credit payment, enter the appropriate GL Account Id for the Bank Account from which the funds were was drawn. Double-click on this field (or press Alt+F7) to select from a list of GL Accounts. The Bank account must be type &#39;Bank&#39;.
