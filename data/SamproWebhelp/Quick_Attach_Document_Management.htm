<h1>Quick Attach Document Management</h1>
<h3>Purpose:</h3>
<p>QuickAttach lets the user select and archive a file to the existing 
 record they are editing or a new record that has not yet been added (e.g., 
 attaching a previously scanned vendor invoice to an AP entry that you 
 are creating). In addition, QuickAttach bypasses several of the steps 
 required by the Attachment button when it is used to attach a file.</p>
<p>Quick Attached documents also reference 
 the appropriate records referenced in a Journal&#39;s child tabs. For example, 
 if a document is Quick Attached to an Inventory Adjustment Journal entry, 
 the Document record will reference the Inventory Adjustment Journal as 
 well as any Jobs and Work Orders specified.</p>
<h3>Registry:</h3>
<p>See <a href="Registry_Quick_Attach.htm">Registry Quick Attach</a> for 
 the registry entries needed to implement this feature and to include document 
 references to additional records.</p>
<h3>Usage:</h3>
<p><img src="assets/images/SKIN1_QuickAttach.bmp" alt="" style="border: none;" border="0"/>The 
 Quick Attach button appears on all viewer sidebars. If QuickAttach is 
 not enabled for the viewer via registry, the system will warn you that 
 QuickAttach is disabled for this function. If QuickAttach is enabled for 
 this viewer, pressing the button opens a browser with the directory to 
 the QuickAttachOpenPath (defined via registry), and then shows all files 
 in that directory.</p>
<p>The user will be warned if the Quick 
 Attach Save path does not exists, and will not be allowed to continue. 
 If the Quick Attach New path does not exist, the browser windows will 
 be opened to the SAMPro root directory, and the user will be allowed to 
 continue. </p>
<p>The user should then select the correct file and click Open. Once you 
 select a file Windows will open the appropriate viewer (e.g., MS Paint, 
 or the Adobe Reader). Simply close this as usual when you have verified 
 that it is the correct file.</p>
<p>At this point, SAMPro’s Select Options for Attaching a Document prompter 
 window appears. The Category and Description fields will default from 
 the applicable registry settings, but may be changed by the user.</p>
<p style="margin-left: 36.00pt;">Pressing OK on the Prompter Window</p>
<p style="margin-left: 66.25pt;">- Attaches the file by creating a new 
 document record that references the existing record immediately or the 
 new record when it is created</p>
<p style="margin-left: 66.25pt;">- AND deletes the attached file from the 
 QuickAttachOpenPath directory</p>
<p style="margin-left: 36.00pt;">Pressing Cancel</p>
<p style="margin-left: 66.25pt;">- Simply clears the cache: the file is 
 not deleted from the QuickAttachOpenPath directory, and is also not attached 
 to the record.</p>
<p style="margin-left: 8px;">When multiple files have been selected the 
 user will be prompted:</p>
<p style="margin-left: 36.00pt; font-weight: bold;">NOTICE: <span style="font-weight: normal;">The 
 following files are pending attachment to this record.<br/>
Click &#39;Yes&#39; to keep these pending files for attachment, and add a new one.<br/>
Click &#39;No&#39; to clear this pending list, and just add a new one.</span></p>
<p style="margin-left: 8px;"><font style="font-weight: bold;">Quick Attaching 
 to</font> <font style="font-weight: bold;">Journal Entries:</font></p>
<p style="margin-left: 8px;">Quick Attach 
 documents may be attached to &#39;locked&#39; journal entries (both the Add and 
 Save button disabled). QA documents are attached immediately when the 
 record is NOT in Add mode.</p>
<p style="margin-left: 8px;">Quick Attach supports multiple workorders/jobs 
 in journal entries. For example, when using QA in the labor journal, the 
 document will be attached to the employee, the journal, the pay period, 
 and ALL Work Order/Jobs referenced in the labor journal entry. See <a href="Registry_Quick_Attach.htm">Registry Quick Attach</a> for the 
 registry entries needed to include document references to additional records.</p>
<p style="margin-left: 48px;">AR Cash 
 Receipts: Quick Attachments also attach to the WorkOrder (via the Service 
 Invoice) per detail line.</p>
<p style="margin-left: 48px;">Inventory 
 Receipt Journal: Quick Attachments also attach to the Job and Work Order 
 per detail line</p>
<p style="margin-left: 48px;">Inventory 
 Adjustment Journal - Quick Attachments also attach to the Work Order/Job 
 per detail line.</p>
<p style="margin-left: 48px;">Purchase 
 Order - Quick Attachments also attach to Job &amp; Work Orders referenced 
 on PO Details lines as well as the PO header. </p>
