<h1>Inventory Restock List</h1>
<h2>Purpose:</h2>
<p>This function provides a simple mechanism for refilling the stock in a stocking location. For example, a location may be a truck. The truck may be normally stocked with many inventory items and has a ‘normal’ stocking level (the Inventory Item&#39;s reorder level for a particular location) for each item. You would like the driver to efficiently keep the truck’s inventory items at their normal stocking levels.</p>
<p>This function also makes inventory history entries showing stock on order at the restock-to location and allocating stock from the restock-from location.</p>
<p>The &quot;trigger&quot; mechanism is that when &quot;on hand&quot; quantity is less than the &quot;reorder level&quot;, an item will qualify for replenishment, and the Quantity to PICK will be however many are required to bring the &quot;on hand&quot; quantity up to the &quot;Order Up To Level.</p>
<p style="margin-left: 36.00pt;">for instance...if 2 are on hand<br/>
                  3 is the reorder level<br/>
                10 is the order up to<br/>
<br/>
then an item would qualify for 8 to be picked.</p>
<h3>Assumptions:</h3>
<p>This function sets the Inventory History Security for Intercompany databases. It also prevents selecting the To and From Locations from different Companies.  </p>
<p>The inventory items normally stocked at a location are identified from the Inventory Item Location tab entries for the location.</p>
<p>The normal stocking level for an item at a specified location is identified by the Inventory Item Location tab&#39;s Reorder Level field.</p>
<h2>Usage:</h2>
<p>This record is used in a five-step process for restocking inventory:</p>
<p style="margin-left: 18.00pt;">1. Create a Restock List for a Location pair, as discussed in this help topic.</p>
<p style="margin-left: 18.00pt;">2. Print the Restock Pick List.</p>
<p style="margin-left: 18.00pt;">3. Pick the items and record the actual quantities picked.</p>
<p style="margin-left: 18.00pt;">4. Use the printed Pick List to enter the quantities picked into the system using the <a href="Inventory_Restock_Pick_List_Entry.htm">Inventory Restock Pick List Entry</a> function.</p>
<p style="margin-left: 18.00pt;">5. The Pick Ticket is Closed (in the <a href="Inventory_Restock_Pick_List_Entry.htm">Inventory Restock Pick List Entry</a> function).</p>
<p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"> </p>
<p>Note that when the restocking list is saved, the following inventory history postings will be generated for each restocking record:</p>
<p style="margin-left: 36.00pt;">The quantity on order at the restock-to location will be incremented by the quantity to be transferred.</p>
<p style="margin-left: 36.00pt;">The quantity allocated at the restock-from location will be incremented by the quantity to be transferred.</p>
<p>When the Close Pick Ticket button is clicked in the Restock Pick Ticket Entry viewer (and the record saved), Inventory History will be adjusted so that any remaining On Order / To Pick quantities are zeroed out. The Status of the Inventory Restock entry will be set to Closed, unless <a href="Registry_Inventory_Restock.htm">a registry entry</a> is in place to delete closed entries (the previous default behavior).</p>
<p>A Status filter range has been added to the Inventory Restock List and Inventory Restock Pick List Entry viewers. By default, this range is set to Open. To view both Open and Closed entries, click the All filter button. To view only Closed entries, click the Closed filter button.</p>
<h2>Registry:</h2>
<p><a href="Registry_Inventory_Restock.htm">Registry Inventory Restock</a></p>
<h2>Screen Organization:</h2>
<p>The upper section of this screen enables you to specify the Restock To and From Locations. Once these fields have been entered, the system will populate the lower section with a list of the items (and quantities) that need to be picked.</p>
<h2>Important Fields: Upper Section</h2>
<p><font style="font-weight: bold;">Transaction Id:<br/></font>If you are creating a new restock list, leave this field blank - it will be completed by the system when the record is saved. To access an existing list, you may enter its Transaction Id.</p>
<p><font style="font-weight: bold;">Restock To Location:<br/></font>Enter the Location Id that you wish to restock to (e.g., a truck 1) or double-click to select from a list of locations.</p>
<p><font style="font-weight: bold;">Restock From Location:<br/></font>Enter the Location Id from which you will restock inventory (e.g., a regional warehouse).</p>
<p style="margin-left: 48px;"><span style="font-weight: bold;">InterCompany Validation:</span> When running with an Intercompany databases, this function prevents selecting the To and From Locations from different Companies.  </p>
<p><font style="font-weight: bold;">Status: Open Closed<br/>
Closed By, Date Closed, and Time Closed</font><font style="font-weight: bold;"><br/></font>These display-only fields are maintained by the system. A Restock entry will be closed by the system when the Close Pick Ticket button is clicked in the View Inventory Restock Pick List Entry viewer. The Closed By, Date Closed, and Time Closed fields will also be set at this time.</p>
<p style="margin-left: 36.00pt;"><font style="font-weight: bold; font-style: italic;" color="#FF0000">Note:<br/></font>When the user enters location ids in both the To and From Location fields, the corresponding restocking records will be retrieved and displayed in the lower section. If there are currently no corresponding restocking records in the system, the user will be asked to confirm that the restocking list should be generated and displayed in the lower section.</p>
<p><img src="assets/images/image/SKIN1_SaveToDisk.gif" alt="" style="border: none;" border="0"/>  Click the Save Record button to save this list.</p>
<p><img src="assets/images/image/printpickticket.gif" alt="image\printpickticket.gif" title="image\printpickticket.gif" width="94" height="28" align="left" border="0"/> Click this button to print a physical pick list. If you have not yet saved this entry, the system will prompt you to do so. This report is ordered by the Bin/Location and then the Inventory Id. Once the pick list has been generated, the user should pick the items on the Restocking Pick Ticket from the restock-from location and write down the quantity actually picked.</p>
<h2>Important Fields: Lower Section</h2>
<p class="Tab" style="background-color: #e5e5e5; border-top: 1.50pt solid #000000; border-bottom: 1.50pt solid #000000; border-left: 1.50pt solid #000000; border-right: 1.50pt solid #000000;">Items Tab</p>
<p><font style="font-weight: bold;">Inventory Item Id: Quantity Needed: Inventory Item Name:<br/></font>The Inventory Item Location table will be searched for inventory items belonging to the restock-to location having a positive quantity needed. The quantity needed is computed as the reorder level less the quantity on hand.</p>
<p><font style="font-weight: bold;">Quantity to Pick:<br/></font>For each of these inventory items, the quantity available at the restock-from location will be computed. If the quantity available is greater than zero, a restocking record for the item will be generated. The Quantity to Pick will be computed as the lesser of the quantity needed at the restock-to location and the quantity available at the restock-from location.</p>

<p><span style="font-weight: bold;">Stocked:</span><br/>
 This display field will be checked if the Item is flagged as a Stocked Item.</p>

<p><span style="font-weight: bold;">Reorder Level:  Order Up To:</span><br/>
 These fields display the current Reorder Level and Order Up To quantities in the Restock To Location.</p>
<p class="Tab" style="background-color: #e5e5e5; border-top: 1.50pt solid #000000; border-bottom: 1.50pt solid #000000; border-left: 1.50pt solid #000000; border-right: 1.50pt solid #000000;">IMH Tab </p>
<p><font style="font-weight: bold;">Item Id: Location On Order: To Pick: Transferred: Received:</font></p>
<p>This tab displays the Inventory History summary for this entry.</p>
<p>When a Restock entry is first created, the On Order value of the Restock To Location, and the To Pick: value of the Order From Location will both default from the Quantity to Pick on the Items tab.</p>
<p>When the Pick List Entry has been completed, the Transferred and Received columns will be updated, and the On Order and To Pick columns revised.</p>
<p>When the Close Pick Tick button is clicked in the Restock Pick Ticket Entry viewer (and the record saved), Inventory History will be adjusted so that any remaining On Order / To Pick quantities are zeroed out.</p>
