<P class="Support_Heading_2" >Auto-sequencing Issues in Job Clone and New Call Backscreen</P>
 <P class="Support" >There are two places where the auto-numbering of Job – and potentially Clients and Sites take place:</P>
 <P class="Support" style="margin-left:36.00pt;">While using the New Call back screen to create a new site it will create a client site/client/job all with the same ID #. This number is generated from the <FONT style="font-weight:bold; " >nextclnt table.</FONT></P>
 <P class="Support" style="margin-left:36.00pt;">While using the clone job function to create a new job, it will create a job ID # that is generated from the <FONT style="font-weight:bold; " >nextjb table</FONT> if the following registry is in effect: </P>
 <P class="Support" style="margin-left:72.00pt;">Id:  Sys-ffv-global-settings</P>
 <P class="Support" style="margin-left:72.00pt;">Contents: AutoSequenceJobId=true (see <A href="internal_registry_job_number_auto_sequencing.htm"><FONT style="color:black; " >Internal Registry Job Number Auto-sequencing</FONT></A> )</P>
 <P class="Support" >It is possible for Id number &quot;collisions&quot; to occur that will result in a 196 error message if the next id in the sequence already exists, as well as the failure of the creation of the record or records. <FONT style="font-weight:bold; text-decoration:underline;" >Job cloning is smart enough to look for the next sequential number</FONT><FONT style="font-weight:bold; text-decoration:underline;" > if this occurs</FONT><FONT style="font-weight:bold; text-decoration:underline;" >; the New Call Backscreen cloning is not!</FONT></P>
 <P class="Support" >Three tables you have to keep in mind here are:</P>
 <P class="Support" style="margin-left:36.00pt;">Nextjb</P>
 <P class="Support" style="margin-left:36.00pt;">Nextclnt</P>
 <P class="Support" style="margin-left:36.00pt;">Nextclntste</P>
 <P class="Support" >Each has a next sequence number that it will use in an auto-numbering setup (Column SEQ).</P>
 <P class="Support" >To see the trouble you can get into if the sequencing boundaries are crossed, assume no existing jobs/clients/site are present in the database.</P>
 <P class="Support" >Say you had nextjbn starting at ‘1000’.</P>
 <P class="Support" >And nextclnt at ‘1500’.</P>
 <P class="Support" >You continue to clone jobs and now you are at job id 1505 (jobs 1000 through 1505 now exist).</P>
 <P class="Support" >Now you try to create a new site by going to the new call back screen and you create a client site/client/job all with the ID of 1501. By using this sequence numbering scheme there will be a conflict because job 1501 already exists.</P>
 <P class="Support" >These tables need to have SEQ numbers that are very far apart so that they never cross paths. Also you have to keep in mind that the jobs/clients/client sites that are manually created never use the same naming convention as the sequence uses, or will ever reach to.&nbsp; If they ever do cross you will get a SQL error that tells you that the ID would not be unique. The same thing goes for the nextclntste table (which should likely be set to your nexclnt sequence). </P>
 <P class="Support" >If the customer is using this sort of autosequencing, they must understand that manually created Job, Client and Site Id’s should never cross the auto-numbering boundaries. The simplest way of doing this is to always include an alphabetic character in any manually generated Job, Client or Site Id’s. </P>
