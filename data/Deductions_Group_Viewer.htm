<h1>Deductions Group Viewer</h1>
<h2>Purpose:</h2>
<p>Create and maintain the Deductions Groups used to implement standard 
 group deductions for union payroll on your system.</p>
<h2>Example:</h2>
<p>Create a Deduction Group for each of the unions employed by your firm.</p>
<h2>Usage:</h2>
<p>Deduction Groups enable you to specify the various deduction types applicable 
 to each class of employees. They are typically used for Union payroll.</p>
<h2>Registry: </h2>
<p><span><a href="Registry_Deduction_Group.htm">Registry Deduction Group</a> 
 - sort Deductions by End Date. </span></p>
<h2>Important Fields: Upper Section</h2>
<p><font style="font-weight: bold;">Note:</font> this Help Topic lists 
 the standard configuration of all fields that may be included in this 
 record. If you are using a customized system, the fields displayed on 
 your screen may not exactly match the order or status (required, optional, 
 default, display-only, hidden, etc.) of the fields described in this Topic.</p>
<p>This screen is divided into two sections. The upper section consists 
 of the data-entry fields that identify this table. The lower section of 
 the screen lists the Deductions records comprising this group (e.g., 401(k), 
 Dues, Vacation, etc.).</p>
<p><font style="font-weight: bold;">Deductions Group Id:</font> (15 character, 
 only . and - special characters)<br/>
A unique Id for this table. This field is required.</p>
<p><font style="font-weight: bold;">Deductions Group Name:</font> (30 character)<br/>
A brief description of this table. This field is optional but highly recommended.</p>
<p><font style="font-weight: bold;">Security Id:</font><br/>
If multiple location security is implemented on your centralized database 
 system, this informational field displays the Security Id of the local 
 user that created this record. If multiple location security is not implemented 
 on your system, or if this record was created by a global user, this field 
 will be blank.</p>
<p><font style="font-weight: bold;">Union Id:</font><br/>
Enter the appropriate Union Id this Deductions Group is always associated 
 with. Double-click on this field to select from a list of Unions.</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: bold;">Classification Id:</span><br/>
This field has been added for reporting purposes at the level of distinction 
 &quot;by Union Classification&quot;</p>
<p><font style="font-weight: bold;">Deductions Group <span>User1-5:</span></font><br/>
These optional fields may be used for entering any information your company 
 wishes to retain (e.g., additional account numbers).</p>
<p><font style="font-weight: bold;">Obsolete</font><font style="font-weight: bold;">?</font><font style="font-weight: bold;"><br/>
</font>If this field is checked, the record is considered Obsolete, and 
 it may not be directly specified during data-entry (either by entering 
 the Id or selecting it from a list). Obsoleted records can be edited and 
 the Obsolete option can be un-done when necessary. When you check the 
 Obsolete field, the following message box will be displayed:</p>
<p style="margin-left: 36.00pt;">“You have elected to obsolete this record. 
 Would you like to see existing references to this record?”</p>
<p>If you click Yes, the system will display a viewer that provides click-through 
 access to all tables referencing this record: see <a href="References_List.htm">References 
 List</a> for details.</p>
<h2>Important Fields: Lower Section</h2>
<p><font style="font-weight: bold;">Deductions Id:</font><br/>
Enter a valid Deductions Id or double-click on this field to select from 
 a list.</p>
<p><font style="font-weight: bold;">Amount:</font> (numeric format 000000.00)<br/>
The dollar amount per Amount Type unit (hourly or fixed) or percentage 
 for Percent Amount Types. If the Amount Type of standard is selected, 
 the Amount in the Deduction record itself will be used. </p>
<p>Note that Compute PR skips Deduction Group lines when the Amount is 
 zero. However, the Deduction line may still be used for certain types 
 of special union reporting.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes;"> </span> When 
 the union has an elective deduction (e.g. 401K union) or employee elects 
 to take an additional amount (e.g. increase VacFund amount by .25).<span style="mso-spacerun: yes;"> </span> Instead of having to 
 create a separate Deductions Group for each Union &amp; Employee or separate 
 Union Deduction Groups w/various percentages/fixed amounts, the setup 
 would include a Deduction record (e.g, 401K Union# or VacFund-Union#) 
 with the UNION ID in the User1 field.</p>
<p style="margin-left: 48px;">This Deduction would be added to the Employee 
 Deductions Tab for those employees taking the deduction, with the appropriate 
 Amount completed.</p>
<p style="margin-left: 48px;"><span>The Deduction (with the UNION ID in 
 the User1 field) would also be added to the Deduction Group(s) for the 
 Union with the Amount set to zero or a base amount.</span><span style="mso-spacerun: yes;"> </span><span> This 
 line is required for reporting purposes so that so that these additional 
 dollars are also picked up on the union report.</span></p>
<p><font style="font-weight: bold;">Amount Type:</font><br/>
This field specifies what the Amount field represents:</p>
<p style="text-indent: 30.25pt;">hourly (for hourly amounts by hours worked)</p>
<p style="text-indent: 30.25pt;">fixed (for a fixed dollar amount per pay 
 period)</p>
<p style="text-indent: 30.25pt;">percent (if the deduction is calculated 
 as a percent of wages)</p>
<p style="margin-left: 36.00pt;">Percent Plus – if this Amount Type is 
 selected, the system will add wages and fringes that are flagged as Add 
 for the Add to Wages for Wage-Based Fringes in the Earning Group record.</p>
<p style="margin-left: 72.00pt;"><font style="font-weight: bold;">Important 
 Note:</font> the Deduction Amount Type of ‘Standard’ is reserved for future 
 use, and should NOT be selected.</p>
<p><font style="font-weight: bold;">Limit:</font> (000000.00000)<br/>
The dollar limit (if any) for deductions of this type.</p>
<p style="margin-left: 36.00pt;"><font style="font-weight: bold;">IMPORTANT 
 NOTE:</font> If the Employee&#39;s Deduction limit is 0, compute payroll uses 
 the Deduction Limit and Deduction Limit Type from the BASE Deduction record. 
  This being the case, then when setting the Deduction Limit Types 
 (n/a, annual, pay period, etc) in the BASE Deduction, the BASE Deduction 
 should contain the UNIVERSAL RULE that apply to ALL employees,  if 
 the deduction limit type varies by employee, then set the Deduction Limit 
 Type to &quot;N/A&quot; in the BASE Deduction.</p>
<p><font style="font-weight: bold;">Limit Type:</font><br/>
If deductions of this type have no dollar limit, enter n/a (or double-click 
 on this field to select from a list). If deductions are capped by law 
 or company policy, select the appropriate time period for the Limit (pay 
 period, monthly, annual, or quarterly).</p>
<p><font style="font-weight: bold;">Start Date: End Date:</font> (date 
 format mmddyyyy)<br/>
The time period for which this amount is valid (e.g., fiscal year, contract 
 period, etc.). If more than one line is entered for the same deduction 
 id, the dates must <font style="font-weight: bold;">NOT</font> overlap. 
 The system now validates that no overlap occurs.</p>
<p><font style="font-weight: bold;">C</font> (1 character)<br/>
This one-character text field may be used to identify the deduction cycle 
 for reporting purposes.</p>
