<h1>Employee Viewer Earnings Tab</h1>
<h2>Purpose:</h2>
<p>Create and maintain an employee&#39;s individualized Earnings information 
 that is used by the system for Labor Journal entries. This tab can include 
 wages, fringes, and job costing entries.</p>
<h2>Example:</h2>
<p>Office Wages, Job Costing Overhead, etc.</p>
<h2>Usage:</h2>
<p>This Tab must be completed for each employee on your payroll, <font style="font-weight: bold; font-style: italic;">unless</font> they 
 are part of the Earnings Group specified in the main Employee record. 
 In this case, the Earnings Group would be used as the default for time 
 card entries. Typically, Earnings Groups are used in Union Payroll applications.</p>
<p style="margin-left: 36.00pt;"><font style="font-weight: bold;">Premium 
 Earnings:</font> It is possible to accommodate the situation where an 
 employee could have a base rate and the earnings group could be used to 
 add a premium ON TOP of that base employee rate. Refer to <a href="Registry_Entry_for_Taxable_Fringe_Benefits.htm">Registry 
 Entry - Compute Payroll</a> for the appropriate registry entry.</p>
<h2>Important Fields:</h2>
<p><font style="font-weight: bold;">Earnings Id:</font><br/>
Enter a valid Earnings Id (or double-click to select from your firm&#39;s list 
 of Earnings records).</p>

<p style="margin-left: 36.00pt;"><font style="font-weight: bold;">Imp</font><font style="font-weight: bold;">ortant Note for Multiple Wage Entries</font><font style="font-weight: bold;">:</font></p>
<p style="margin-left: 36.00pt;">We support multiple HOURLY amounts to 
 multiple Earnings ID’s.</p>
<p style="margin-left: 36.00pt;">We do NOT support mixing HOURLY and SALARY</p>
<p style="margin-left: 36.00pt;">We do NOT support multiple SALARY amounts</p>


<p><font style="font-weight: bold;">Amount:</font> (numeric format 00000000.00)<br/>
The dollar amount (per Amount Type). For example, $12.50 hourly, $43,000 
 annual salary, etc.</p>
<p><font style="font-weight: bold;">Amount Type:</font><br/>
This field specifies what the Amount field represents: hourly, salary (annual), 
 or percent.</p>
<p>The Amount Type of Fixed (per Payroll Period) is available for Fringes. 
 This could be used to record taxable, company-owned vehicle usage. Validation 
 ensures that the Amount Type of Fixed may only be selected if all of the 
 following are true:</p>
<p style="margin-left: 48px;">The Earnings Type is set to Fringe<br/>
The Fringe is not Accrued<br/>
The Fringe is not Job Costed</p>
<p><font style="font-weight: bold;">Start Date:</font> (date format mmddyyyy) 
  <font style="font-weight: bold;">End Date:</font> (date format mmddyyyy)<br/>
Enter starting and ending <font style="font-weight: bold;">working</font> 
 dates to define the time period that this Earning Id and Amount is valid 
 for. These fields are compared with the Effective Date of labor hours 
 recorded in the Labor Journal or the LAB tab of Work Orders. Enter the 
 dates in <font style="font-style: italic;">mmddyyyy</font> format or press 
 Alt+F7 (or double-click on the field)to access the Calendar to do so.</p>
<p>If more than one line is entered for the same earnings id/pay type combination, 
 the dates must <font style="font-weight: bold;">NOT</font> overlap. The 
 system now validates that no overlap occurs.</p>
<p style="margin-left: 36.00pt;"><font style="font-weight: bold;" color="#0000FF">Tip:</font> 
 <font style="font-weight: bold;">Handling Salary and Hourly Wage Increases</font><br/>
If this employee receives a earnings increase, you would add a new Earnings 
 line (or lines) with a Start Date corresponding to the first working day 
 (the Effective Date of the labor hours entered) at the new salary or hourly 
 wage BEFORE POSTING LABOR HOURS. The End Date of the old Earnings line 
 should be the last Effective Date worked at that rate (or the day preceding 
 the new Start Date). Hourly Employee&#39;s wages may be increased on any date 
 within a pay period BEFORE POSTING LABOR HOURS. <font style="font-weight: bold;">Note: 
 For Salary Employees, the Start Date in the Earning tab must always correspond 
 to the Start Date of the Payroll Period the increase will occur in.</font> 
 Hourly Employees may get an increase in the middle of a Pay Period BEFORE 
 POSTING LABOR HOURS, but Salaried Employees may not. If an Hourly employee 
 gets an increase in the middle of a pay period, the user should set up 
 the increase BEFORE posting hours to the LABOR JOURNAL/WORKORDER.</p>
<p><font style="font-weight: bold;">Add Pay Rate Factor?</font><br/>
If this box is checked (by double-clicking or pressing the Spacebar), the 
 Rate Factor (in the Pay Type record) will be used to calculate the Pay 
 Rate when making time card entries in the Labor Journal. In most cases, 
 this field should be flagged for Wage type Earnings. </p>
<p style="margin-left: 48px;"><span style="font-weight: bold;">NOTE:</span> 
 If the Start Compute Overtime functionality is being used, this field 
 <span style="font-weight: bold;">must</span> be flagged for wage lines 
 that may be subject to overtime computations. </p>
<p><font style="font-weight: bold;">Wage -  Fringe <span>- Burden 
 - Standard Cost</span></font><br/>
<font style="font-weight: bold;">Taxable?  Job Cost?  Accrue?</font><br/>
These display-only fields default from the Earnings record.</p>
<p><font style="font-weight: bold;">Click the Magnify Button to Access</font></p>
<p><font style="font-weight: bold;">Pay Type:<br/>
</font>This field should only be completed to enable an alternative way 
 of determining overtime or double-time pay. This would be done if overtime 
 isn&#39;t at a 1.5 multiplier.  In this setup, you would create 
 two earnings lines for base wages for the same Earnings Id:</p>
<p style="margin-left: 36.00pt;">The first earnings line for base wages 
 would be your regular one; the Pay Type would NOT be filled in.</p>
<p style="margin-left: 36.00pt;">The second earnings line for base wages 
 line would be for the same Earnings Id, but with the Pay Type Id completed. 
 Typically, it would point to an OT Pay Type with its Rate Factor set to 
 1.0; . In addition, you would specify the actual OT pay rate in the earnings 
 line. This line would be used instead of the first ONLY IF the Pay Type 
 matched on the Labor lines entered.</p>
<p style="margin-left: 36.00pt;">Example:</p>
<p style="margin-left: 36.00pt;">Earnings Id: Amount: Pay Type 
 Id: <br/>
base  27 (blank)<br/>
base  43 OT (rate factor = 1.0. Hours Type=Worked, Category=Overtime)</p>
<p style="margin-left: 36.00pt;">In this example, when time was entered 
 using a Pay Type of ‘OT’, the base earnings would be calculated as $43.00 
 instead of $40.50 per hour (27.00x1.5). In the traditional SAMPRO setup, 
 the line 2 entry would not exist and the Pay Type would have a Rate Factor 
 of 1.5.  In that scenario the employee&#39;s OT pay rate would be 
 $40.50 per hour (27.00x1.5).</p>
