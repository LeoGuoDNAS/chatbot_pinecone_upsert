<h1>Print W2 Forms (Old Report)</h1>
<p>This version of the W2 report requires a W2 printer that supports <font style="font-weight: bold;">native PCL 5c or below printing</font>: 
 driver-based (host based) PCL is <font style="font-weight: bold;">not</font> 
 acceptable due to the need to print exact output to the W2 forms.</p>
<p>See <a href="Report_PR_W2s_Standard.htm">Report PR W-2s (Standard)</a> 
 for the new W2 report which does NOT require native PCL printing. The 
 new <a href="Report_PR_W3_Standard.htm">Report PR W-3s (Standard)</a> 
 may be run stand-alone and also does NOT require native PCL printing.</p>
<h2>Purpose:</h2>
<p>This function is used to print W2 Forms.</p>
<p style="margin-left: 36.00pt;"><font style="font-weight: bold;">W3 Support</font></p>
<p style="margin-left: 36.00pt;">The Copy A option of Report W2 allows 
 the printing of a W3 form at the end of the report. The system will print 
 the Copy A’s and summary page as usual, and then pause. The following 
 message box will appear:</p>
<p style="margin-left: 36.00pt;"> Print W3 Form? Insert W3 Form Now.</p>
<p style="margin-left: 36.00pt;">If you want to print the W3, DO <font style="font-weight: bold;">NOT</font> RESPOND TO THIS MESSAGE IMMEDIATELY. 
 To print the W3 form, the user should verify that all Copy A’s plus the 
 summary page have been printed, and then load the W3 form in the printer.</p>
<p style="margin-left: 36.00pt;"><font style="font-weight: bold;">After</font> 
 the W3 form has been loaded, the user should then click Yes in the message 
 box to print the W3 form. Note that if taxes for more than one state have 
 been assessed, an X will be printed in the State portion of Box 15, and 
 the Employer’s state ID number will be blank.</p>
<h2>Usage:</h2>
<p>Successful W2 reporting depends on properly formatted registry entries 
 and tax-related records.  Click <a href="W2_Records_and_Setup.htm">W2 
 Records and Setup</a> to review your records as discussed <span style="font-weight: bold;">before</span> 
 running your W2&#39;s.</p>
<h2>Printer Requirements:</h2>
<p>Your W2 printer must support <font style="font-weight: bold;">native 
 PCL 5c or below printing</font>: driver-based (host based) PCL is <font style="font-weight: bold;">not</font> acceptable due to the need to 
 print exact output to this report for the W2 forms.</p>
<p>See Report PR W-2s (Standard) for the new W2 report which does NOT require 
 native PCL printing. The new Report PR W-3s (Standard) may be run stand-alone 
 and also does NOT require native PCL printing.</p>
<h2>Registry Entries:</h2>
<p><a href="Registry_Entry_W2_and_W3_Printing.htm">Registry W2 Printing 
 (sys-report-rw2)</a> . This registry also supports the additional fields 
 required for W3 printing.</p>
<p>The <a href="Registry_Entry_Federal_EIN.htm">Registry Entry Federal 
 and State EIN</a> and <a href="Registry_Company_Name_Entry.htm">Registry 
 Company Name Entry</a> must be also be set correctly.</p>
<p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"> </p>
<h2>Important Fields:</h2>
<p><font style="font-weight: bold;">Report Options:</font><br/>
The Report Options selector pane controls how the report will be output. 
 Click <a href="Report_Options.htm">Report Options</a> to learn more.</p>
<p><font style="font-weight: bold;">Range:</font><br/>
Enter a unique, alphanumeric name to save and identify your customized 
 report Range. Your default Id fields will not be saved unless you name 
 your range.</p>
<p><font style="font-weight: bold;">Copy to Print: A B C D 1 2</font> <span style="font-weight: bold;"><br/>
</span>Select the appropriate print option by double-clicking on the radio 
 button adjacent to it. Remember to verify that the correct paper is loaded 
 in the printer!</p>
<p><font style="font-weight: bold;">Option A:</font><br/>
This option should be used to print the red Copy A for the Social Security 
 Administration (unless filing electronically). One 2-up W2 form will be 
 printed for each employee with Federal/FICA wages plus a summary page 
 at the end of the run. This report will be ordered by the Sort Employees 
 By option. Note: in general, you would leave the Tax Authority Id, Type 
 and State fields blank for this run. The Employee Id range enables you 
 to reprint W2&#39;s for one or more employees or to print an alignment copy.</p>
<p><font style="font-weight: bold;">Option B:</font><br/>
This 2 option should be used to print the black Copy B to be filed with 
 the employee&#39;s Federal Tax Return. One 2-up W2 form will be printed for 
 each employee with Federal/FICA. This report will be ordered by the Sort 
 Employees By option. Note: in general, you would leave the Tax Authority 
 Id, Type and State fields blank for this run. The Employee Id range enables 
 you to reprint W2&#39;s for one or more employees or to print an alignment 
 copy.</p>
<p><font style="font-weight: bold;">Option C:</font><br/>
Option C should be used to print the black Copy C to be retained by the 
 employee. One 2-up W2 form will be printed for each employee with Federal/FICA. 
 This report will be ordered by the Sort Employees By option. Note: in 
 general, you would leave the Tax Authority Id, Type and State fields blank 
 for this run. The Employee Id range enables you to reprint W2&#39;s for one 
 or more employees or to print an alignment copy.</p>
<p><font style="font-weight: bold;">Option D:</font><br/>
Option D should be used to print the black Copy D to be retained by the 
 employer. One 2-up W2 form will be printed for each employee with Federal/FICA 
 wages plus a summary page at the end of the run. This report will be ordered 
 by the Sort Employees By option. Note: in general, you would leave the 
 Tax Authority Id, Type and State fields blank for this run. The Employee 
 Id range enables you to reprint W2&#39;s for one or more employees or to print 
 an alignment copy.</p>
<p style="margin-left: 8px;"><font style="font-weight: bold;">Copy 1:</font><br/>
Copy 1 should be used to print the black Copy 1 to be delivered by the 
 employer to the State and Local Taxing Authorities. One 2-up W2 form will 
 be printed for each employee/taxing authority combination where the employee 
 earned wages. This report will be ordered by the Tax Authority Id first, 
 and the Sort Employees By option within each Taxing Authority. A summary 
 totals page will be produced for each taxing authority. In order to produce 
 separate runs for state and local authorities, you may wish to produce 
 one print run with the Type range completed as state, and another with 
 the Type specified as local.</p>
<p style="margin-left: 48px;"><span style="font-weight: bold;">TIP:</span> 
 Running with the  Type Range set to: <span style="font-weight: bold;">state,local</span> 
 will also provide summary totals pages for each Tax Authority. This eliminates 
 the need to run Copy 1 multiple times. See additional details in the Type 
 range documentation below. </p>
<p style="margin-left: 8px;"><font style="font-weight: bold;">Copy 2:</font><br/>
Copy 2 should be used to print the black Copy 2 to be filed with the employee&#39;s 
 State and Local Taxing Authorities. One 2-up W2 form will be printed for 
 each employee/taxing authority combination where the employee earned wages. 
 This report will be sorted by employee (in either Id or Last Name order) 
 so that all W2&#39;s for an employee will be printed together. See the &quot;Type&quot; 
 range for details on how to run Copy 2.</p>
<p><font style="font-weight: bold; font-style: italic;">The following are 
 4-up Print Options; these options are NOT recommended due to alignment 
 issues</font></p>
<p><font style="font-weight: bold;">BC2</font><br/>
This option prints 1 copy B, 1 copy C, and 2 copies of 2 on one page in 
 the 4-up Horizontal format. One employee will be listed on each page. 
 Note that since only 2 copy 2’s are printed, additional copies of this 
 report will need to be printed if more than one state plus one local authority 
 (or 2 local authorities or 2 states) would be printed for a single employee’s 
 W-2.</p>
<p><font style="font-weight: bold;">Sort Employee By: Last Name Social 
 Security Number</font><br/>
This option controls the output order of the W2&#39;s within taxing authority. 
 Double-click on the radio button adjacent to an option to select it.</p>
<p><font style="font-weight: bold;">Year:</font><br/>
Enter the year the W2&#39;s are being produced for (e.g., 2018). This field 
 must be completed in order for your W2&#39;s to print.</p>
<p><font style="font-weight: bold;">Start Date End Date<br/>
</font>The system will now set the Start Date(01/01) and the End Date (12/31) 
 whenever the Year field gets changed. These dates may not be edited by 
 the used unless specified by the <a href="Registry_W2_Entry.htm">Registry 
 Entry for W2&#39;s</a> . These fields would be edited to enable partial year 
 reporting for your W2’s. This would be desirable if, for example, your 
 company’s EIN changed mid-year.</p>
<p style="margin-left: 36.00pt;"><font style="font-weight: bold;">Tip: 
 Setting the EIN<br/>
</font>If your company’s EIN changed, you must set/reset it via the <a href="Registry_Entry_Federal_EIN.htm">Registry Entry Federal and State 
 EIN</a> prior to running this report so that the correct EIN for the correct 
 time of year will print on the W2’s. Be sure to set it to the correct 
 (current) value when you have finished running your reports.</p>
<p><font style="font-weight: bold;">Plain Paper Copy?</font><br/>
If this field is checked, the system will produce an informational report 
 that includes header information for each field. DO NOT check this box 
 when aligning or printing live copies of the W2&#39;s.</p>
<p><font style="font-weight: bold;">Tax Authority Id:</font><br/>
This field enables you to only print W2&#39;s for a single tax authority or 
 series of authorities. It is not recommended for Copy Options A,B,C or 
 D.</p>
<p><font style="font-weight: bold;">State Id:</font><br/>
This field enables you to only print W2&#39;s for a single state or series 
 of states: <span style="font-weight: bold;">be sure to enter the two character 
 state abbreviation!</span>. It is not recommended for Copy Options A,B,C 
 or D.</p>

 Authorities (typically state, local, other). It is not recommended for 
 Copy Options A,B,C or D.</p>
<p style="margin-left: 48px;"><font style="font-weight: bold;">Tip: Avoiding 
 Unnecessary Printing - Copy 1 and Copy 2<br/>
Most users would enter</font> <font style="font-weight: bold;">state,local 
 </font>in the Type range field to print employer W2&#39;s with totals for 
 each state and local Tax Authority.</p>
<p style="margin-left: 48px;"><span style="font-weight: bold;">If your 
 data is configured with Other as being a Local tax</span>, then run Copy 
 1 and Copy 2 using Type: <span style="font-weight: bold;">state,local,other</span> 
 skipping SUTA,SUI,etc. in the Tax Authority Id: range (set to ~SUTA,SUI).</p>
<p><font style="font-weight: bold;">Employee Id:</font><br/>
This field enables you to only print W2&#39;s for a single employee or series 
 of employees. It is recommended for reprinting W2&#39;s and for aligning your 
 forms. </p>
<p><font style="font-weight: bold;">Executive Payroll</font>:<br/>
If you are an Executive Payroll user, this field will default to Y; to 
 print copies for all employees (Executive or not) clear this range. If 
 your user record is not flagged as Executive Payroll, you will only be 
 able to print forms for other non-Executive users. <span>The Executive 
 Payroll status of the Payroll Period used to record time is not considered 
 when printing W-2&#39;s.</span></p>
