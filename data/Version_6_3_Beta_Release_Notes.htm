<H1>Version 7.0.436.178 Release Notes</H1>
 <H1>Data-Basics Software and Support Services</H1>
 <P><A href="version_6_3_beta_release_notes.htm#7.0_Patches">Recent Patches and Enhancements</A> </P>
 <P><FONT style="font-weight:bold; text-decoration:underline;" >IMPORTANT NOTE: Index may need to be added to Sybase databases    </FONT></P>
 <P>Anyone with Sybase running version 7.0.436.136 and higher <FONT style="font-weight:bold; text-decoration:underline;" >requires</FONT> that an index be installed in the database due to the latest performance issues with journals. It is possible that this index is already installed, but it depends on the last time the data went through the Sampro update function. Your support representative will be able to verify that this index is already present or will be added to your data if you re running a Sybase database.  </P>
 <H1>1 System</H1>
 <H2>1.0 Important Data Conversion Notes on Job Templates</H2>
 <P>This version provides for the use of template Job, Clients and Site. Template jobs are prevented from having work orders (accidentally) attached to them, and provide a standardized starting point for the creation of new record structures.</P>
 <P>Before data conversation, all of your current jobs, sites and clients that include the word <FONT style="font-weight:bold; " >template</FONT> (not case sensitive – Template or TEMPLATE will also be picked up) in the name or id field will be flagged as a template record during conversion.</P>
 <P>We strongly recommend that you review your data to verify that the records that should be flagged as templates include the word template in the name or id field.  Client, Site and Job records that should not be flagged as templates should not include the word template in the name or id.  To quickly ascertain which records this may impact, enter the characters %template% on the name and then the id fields of the client, site and job records.  See sections 4.1, 4.6, 4.7, 4.8, 6.4 and 6.5 of the customer notes for details. </P>
 <H2>1.0.1 Job Templates Overview </H2>
 <P>Job Templates enable you to define various types of standard job, site and equipment structures that facilitate the creation of new customers and/or Sites from the Job Record or from New Call.  </P>
 <H3>Accessing the Templates Viewers</H3>
 <P class="Reference_Line" style="margin-bottom:0.00pt;">In order to access the Job, Client Site and Client Template viewers, your user group must have rights to these viewers. It is recommended this ability is limited to supervisory or other advanced users. </P>
 <H2>Registry Entries</H2>
 <P><A href="registry_entry_job_and_job_cloning.htm">Registry Entry Job and Job Cloning</A> </P>
 <P><A href="registry_entry_for_new_call_options.htm">Registry Entry for New Call Options</A> </P>
 <H2>Setting Up Your Templates</H2>
 <H3 style="text-indent:30.25pt;">Step 1:  Decide on your Job Structures</H3>
 <P class="Reference_Line" style="margin-left:36.00pt;margin-bottom:0.00pt;">Decide how your various template jobs should be structured in terms of cost codes, billing items and so on. You may wish to have several types of templates – for residential clients, commercial clients, and so on. </P>
 <H3 style="text-indent:30.25pt;">Step 2: Create the Client Template Record </H3>
 <P style="margin-left:36.00pt;">Create a Client Template record in View Client Templates. The Template box must be checked. Only those fields that will be common to ALL clients generated from this Template should be filled in. All other fields in this template record (except those required to save the record) should be blank. </P>
 <H3 style="text-indent:30.25pt;">Step 3: Create the Client Site Template Record </H3>
 <P style="margin-left:36.00pt;">Create a Client Site Template record in View Client Site Templates. The Template box must be checked. Only those fields that will be common to ALL sites generated from this Template should be filled in. All other fields in this template record (except those required to save the record) should be blank. </P>
 <H3 style="text-indent:30.25pt;">Step 4: Create the Job Template Record </H3>
 <P style="margin-left:36.00pt;">Create a Job Template record in View Job Templates. The Template box must be checked.  Set the Client and Client Site Id’s to the Client and Client Site Templates you just created.</P>
 <P style="margin-left:36.00pt;">Aside from the Client and Client Site fields, only those fields that will be common to ALL jobs generated from this Template should be filled in. All other fields in this template record (except those required to save the record) should be blank. </P>
 <H3 style="text-indent:30.25pt;">Step 5: Create the Job Billing Item Record(s) </H3>
 <P style="margin-left:36.00pt;">Create at least one Job Billing Item record for each of your template jobs. The information on this record will be used for invoicing. All Billing Items associated with the Job will be cloned during the New Call Create and Clone Job Wizard processes.  Typically, the Invoice and Billing Worksheet fields would be completed.</P>
 <H3 style="text-indent:30.25pt;">Step 6: Create the Job Cost Code Record(s) </H3>
 <P style="margin-left:36.00pt;">Create at least one Job Cost Code Billing Item record for each of your template jobs.  All Cost Codes associated with the Job will be cloned during the New Call Create and Clone Job Wizard processes.  </P>
 <H3 style="text-indent:30.25pt;">Step 7: Create a Site Equipment Record </H3>
 <P style="margin-left:36.00pt;">Create at least one Site Equipment record for each of your template sites.  Be sure to complete the Job fields in this record with your Template Job. </P>
 <H2>1.0.2 Using your Template Files with Job Clone Wizard </H2>
 <P>You may select a Template Job in the regular Job Account Viewer. You will not be able to edit the Template, but you will be able to launch the Clone Job Wizard. When the Job has been cloned, it will appear in Job Viewer so that you can easily edit it and its associated records. </P>
 <H2>1.03 Using your Template Files With New Call Create </H2>
 <P>Once your template records have been created, using them in New Call is as simple as A-B-C. </P>
 <H3 style="text-indent:30.25pt;">Step A: Verify the Customer is Not Already in your Database </H3>
 <P style="margin-left:36.00pt;">Use the New Call's Search Text feature to verify that the customer is not already included on your database: be sure to search by Name and at least one other parameter, such as phone number or street address. </P>
 <H3 style="text-indent:30.25pt;">Step B: Select the residential Client Site and Switch to New Call Create </H3>
 <P style="margin-left:36.00pt;">Once you are sure that the customer is not in your database, select the residential site on the Client Site list in New Call. </P>
 <P style="margin-left:36.00pt;"><IMG src="images/flash.gif" border="0" height="28" width="48" alt="images\flash.gif"> With residential selected, click the Search button to turn Search Off and Create on. </P>
 <H3 style="text-indent:30.25pt;">Step C: Enter the New Client Site, Equipment and Work Order Information </H3>
 <P style="margin-left:36.00pt;">In the New Call Create screen, type over the Client Site Id residential with your firm's id for this client site. Enter the work order and equipment fields as discussed in the <A href="new_call_create_new_client_site_equipment_viewer.htm">New Call Create</A> Help Topic.  The Client Id and Name must remain blank: when you click the Add record button, the system will also create a new client record with the same Id as that of the new client site.  </P>
 <H3>1.0.4 Using Template Files with New COD Site</H3>
 <P>If your firm uses this functionality you will need to set up one or more COD Template Sites that reference an AR Terms Id that has the COD box checked; these are the only Template Sites that will appear on the New COD Site screen.</P>
 <H2>1.1 User Viewer</H2>
 <P><FONT style="font-weight:bold; " >Executive P/R?<BR></FONT>This field has been added to both the User and Employee records.&nbsp; By definition:</P>
 <P style="margin-left:23.75pt;">An Executive P/R Employee is only accessible by an Executive P/R User.</P>
 <P style="margin-left:23.75pt;">The Executive Payroll check box in an Employee record may only be set or cleared by a user with the Executive Payroll box checked in their user record </P>
 <P style="margin-left:23.75pt;">An Executive P/R User has full access to ALL employees.</P>
 <P class="Reference_Line" style="margin-bottom:0.00pt;">Executive Payroll enter/edit restrictions have been applied so that users without the Executive Payroll flag will not be able to access entries for Executive Payroll Employees in the Labor Journal, PR Journal and Job Journal as well as many reports.  See section 8.3 of these notes for details. </P>
 <P style="margin-left:36.00pt;"><FONT style="font-weight:bold; " >Executive Payroll List Views:</FONT>  In previous releases, users that have the Executive Payroll option selected in the user record only saw employees marked as Executive PR because the filter is preset to Executive PR=Y. This has been changed so that they can see all employees on the list by default. This impacts the Employee, Labor Journal, and Payroll Journal list views. </P>
 <P><FONT style="font-weight:bold; " >Notes Administrator?<BR></FONT>Checking this new field<FONT style="font-weight:bold; " > </FONT>designates the user as a notes administrator that will override the ownership security on record notes. Any user designated as a Notes Administrator will be able to change or delete ANY public or private note record note even if it is marked private and the user is not the owner.</P>
 <P><FONT style="font-weight:bold; " >Discipline Filter</FONT><FONT style="font-weight:bold; " >:<BR></FONT>This filter has been implemented for use with Job Cost Reporting. This field may be used to limit job reporting information to only those Disciplines listed in this field.  Note that a report must include the Discipline key for this feature to be implemented.  Data-Basics’ standard job cost reports were updated to include this key as of November, 2007 and revision level 6.3.</P>
 <H3>1.1.1 Enhanced Security Switching</H3>
 <P><FONT style="font-weight:bold; " >New Fields (Security Table)</FONT></P>
 <P><FONT style="font-weight:bold; " >Branch Id:  Location Id:<BR>Branch Filter:   Location Filter:  PM Reporting Filter:</FONT></P>
 <P>These fields may be accessed by clicking the Magnify button. If completed, the system will now also switch these fields and filters when security is switched.  </P>
 <H2>1.2  Folders Viewer</H2>
 <P>The Forward color of folders tabs has been changed to White.</P>
 <P>Minor organizational changes to standard folders.</P>
 <H2>1.3 Zip Code Viewer</H2>
 <P><FONT style="font-weight:bold; " >New Fields– </FONT></P>
 <P><FONT style="font-weight:bold; " >Sales Tax Group:<BR></FONT>Added for defaulting purposes in the Job record.</P>
 <P><FONT style="font-weight:bold; " >Branch Id:</FONT><BR>Added for defaulting purposes in the Job, Site, Vendor and New Call / COD Site records. </P>
 <H2>1.4  Common Phrases</H2>
 <P>Text size increased from 400 to 1200 characters. </P>
 <P>Note that common phrases will no longer be invoked in single-line text boxes.</P>
 <H2>1.5 Documents and Scanning</H2>
 <P>An updated xmltopdf.jar is included with this image. It should correct issues with extraneous xml files being retained in the xmlToPdf_Sent folder when invoices are auto-emailed. </P>
 <P>This release also corrects an error that occurred when the auto-emailing functionality of Service Invoice attempted to archive another copy of the report that it had just emailed. The system no longer attempts to archive the emailed copy in addition to the other copies that are being saved / archived as defined in the registry settings for the report. </P>
 <H3>1.5.1 Key Search </H3>
 <P><FONT style="font-weight:bold; " >Key Search Words<BR></FONT>The purpose of this new field is to provide a means of searching for documents using a key words search.&nbsp; At the present time, this field can only be populated from the Document viewer.&nbsp; </P>
 <P><FONT style="font-family:'Tahoma'; color:black; " >It is also available from the Document filter form so that you can search for Documents based on their Key Search Words.</FONT></P>
 <P style="margin-left:36.00pt;"><FONT style="font-family:'Tahoma'; color:black; text-decoration:underline;" >Examples:</FONT></P>
 <P style="margin-left:36.00pt;"><FONT style="font-family:'Tahoma'; color:black; " >Suppose you enter the phrase ‘vendor invoice’ when you scan your vendor invoices from the AP Journal. To filter your documents to view only those with this exact phrase, the Key Search Word range would be entered as:</FONT></P>
 <P style="margin-left:41.75pt;text-indent:30.25pt;"><FONT style="font-family:'Tahoma'; color:black; " >vendor invoice</FONT></P>
 <P style="margin-left:41.75pt;"><FONT style="font-family:'Tahoma'; color:black; " >As many individual key words and/or phrases can be entered as necessary.&nbsp; On the viewer's filter screen, the entry might look like this...<BR><BR>%vendor%,%invoice%,%customer%,%AP Check%<BR><BR>That would select every document record that contained the phrases 'vendor' OR 'invoice' OR 'customer' OR 'AP Check' in the Key Search Words list.</FONT></P>
 <H3>1.5.2  PDF Enhancement for Documents with Multiple Images</H3>
 <P>This enhancement is made to support multi-page scanning.  If the file in the Document Viewer header is a bmp, jpg or gif AND the Document contains multiple images, the Show Document button (in the Document header) and the View Document Button (on the Document List) now offer the user the option of displaying the images as a single PDF file.&nbsp; At this time, only bmp, gif and jpg files will be assembled into the pdf.</P>
 <H3>1.5.3 Scanning Documents – fixes and enhancement</H3>
 <P>Corrects problem with file naming where the record id contained a period (.) or forward slash (/); the system was unable to locate these records.  These characters are now replaced with underscores in the filename. </P>
 <P>The Scan Wizard now displays a warning message if the user presses the Cancel button. At this point, they may confirm the cancellation or return to the wizard to finish the scan. It seems that some users were unintentionally canceling the wizard process, or x’ing out of the wizard without finishing the scan. The ‘x’ button has been removed. </P>
 <P>The delete record/line operation now also deletes the associated archive file. </P>
 <H3>1.5.4  View Documents attached to Journal Entries</H3>
 <P>In previous releases, documents attached the base transaction of a journal entry could not be viewed from changes to the journal entry (with tack numbers).  The system now uses the journal base reference id as a wildcard to lookup documents associated with a journal entry so that all the documents (associated with the base entry or any of the tack numbers) will be listed. The enhancement affects the AR Sales Journal, GL Journal, GL Budget Journal, Cash Receipts Journal, PO Journal, Inventory Receipt Journal, AP Journal, Inventory Journal and Shop Order Journal. </P>
 <H2>1.6  Revised Reports</H2>
 <P><FONT style="font-weight:bold; " >Reports Revised for Expanded Client Site Equi</FONT><FONT style="font-weight:bold; " >pment Manufacturer Model Number</FONT></P>
 <P>The following UserReport-type reports have been updated to accommodate the Client Site Equipment's Model Number (which was expanded to 50 characters for v6.3).&nbsp; These reports may be obtained from your support representative for import into your database.</P>
 <P style="margin-left:72.00pt;">Component for &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;CSERPFT2.rpt<BR>Component for&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;CTCHPFT2.rpt<BR>Component for &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;CCPFTR3.rpt<BR>Report PM Agreement&nbsp;&nbsp;RPMAGRMNT.rpt<BR>Report Site Service History&nbsp;&nbsp;RSRVCEHSTRYDTL.rpt<BR>Report Work Order Details&nbsp;&nbsp;wodetail.rpt<BR>Workorder Field Ticket&nbsp;&nbsp;woticket.rpt<BR>Report Client Site Equipment&nbsp;&nbsp;RCLNTSTEEQPMNT.rpt<BR>Report Technician Workorder Details&nbsp;RTCHWOD.rpt</P>
 <P><FONT style="font-weight:bold; " >Reports – Correct 208 Error Invalid Object Name:</FONT> The following reports have been updated to correct an error that displayed if the report was run with parameters that would produce no data: DARAGE, DARAGE-ABRN, RCUSTSTMNT, RPRPURR. Your support representative will be able to provide revised version of these reports. </P>
 <P><FONT style="font-weight:bold; " >Customer Statement and AR Aging Report Enhancement for Consolidated Invoices</FONT><FONT style="font-weight:bold; " >: </FONT>The reports RCUSTSTMNT.rpt, DARAGE.rpt and CARCAGE.rpt have been updated to support consolidated invoicing.  These reports now included a Consolidated Invoices option; it this is set to Yes, the Consolidated Invoice will appear on the report.  Your support representative will be able to provide revised version of these reports. </P>
 <P><FONT style="font-weight:bold; " >Payroll Report – EEOC:</FONT> The PREEOC.rpt report has been modified to include the new EEOC classes. Your support representative will be able to provide revised version of this report.</P>
 <P><FONT style="font-weight:bold; " >Inventory</FONT><FONT style="font-weight:bold; " > Audit Report <BR></FONT>A new range field, Stocked, has been added to Inventory Audit Report. You must import the DINVTRYADT.RPT dated 3/2/2009 or later into your data. The default value of the range is set  to &quot;Y&quot; so that only items flagged as Stocked will be listed.  To show all items, the range field may be cleared.  To show only items whose Stocked field is blank, enter “N” in the Stocked range and then run the report.</P>
 <P><FONT style="font-weight:bold; " >Mailing Labels</FONT></P>
 <P>The following reports have been revised to allow the user to select the format (5161 or 8163) and enter a top margin value for alignment:</P>
 <P style="margin-left:36.00pt;">Report Mailing Labels - Client  (ARCLABEL.rpt)</P>
 <P style="margin-left:36.00pt;">Report Mailing Labels - Client Site (ARCSLABEL.rpt)</P>
 <P style="margin-left:36.00pt;">Report Mailing Label Employee (PRELABEL.rpt)</P>
 <P style="margin-left:36.00pt;">Report Mailing Label Vendor (APVLABEL.rpt)</P>
 <P>These reports are now available for download and installed into your customer’s databases.  The Employee version is dated 5/27/2009, and the others are 5/15/2009.</P>
 <P style="margin-left:36.00pt;"><FONT style="font-weight:bold; " >Important - Registry Setting Required:</FONT> A registry entry for each of the mailing label functions must be created which contains the following contents line: LinesPerPage=65</P>
 <P style="margin-left:66.25pt;">Id: sys-report-APVLABEL  Contents: LinesPerPage=65</P>
 <P style="margin-left:66.25pt;">Id: sys-report-ARCLABEL  Contents: LinesPerPage=65</P>
 <P style="margin-left:66.25pt;">Id: sys-report-ARCSLABEL  Contents: LinesPerPage=65</P>
 <P style="margin-left:66.25pt;">Id: sys-report-PRELABEL  Contents: LinesPerPage=65</P>
 <H2>1.7 Save Report as PDF – selecting a directory</H2>
 <P>This corrects a bug where it was always saving the report to the current SAM Pro directory, and not the directory selected in the file dialog box.</P>
 <H2>1.8 Daylight Savings Time</H2>
 <P>SAM Pro has been updated to conform to the new  rules that, starting in March 2007, daylight time in the United States will begin on the second Sunday in March and end on the first Sunday in November.  This information is used for Time Zone offsets.  It is dependent upon a correct server time; be sure to verify that your servers are displaying the correct time when Daylight Savings goes into effect. </P>
 <H2>1.9 Print Screen Functionality</H2>
 <P>The Faststone free screenshot capturing software has been used successfully by our support department to supplement the SAM Pro File &gt;&gt; Print Screen function that has been experiencing intermittent problems. You can Google 'FastStone' to get to it easily. With FastStone, you push your keyboard's PrintScreen key and then push the Print button on the screen that opens.</P>
 <H2>1.10 Required Fields and Disabled Fields</H2>
 <P>SAM Pro now supports required field color coding. Users may now set the background color of required fields via the Set Color Palette button on the second line of the Top Button Bar. Fields that are required by the software – or by registry settings (see below) will both be displayed with the background color.</P>
 <P>Disabled fields will now appear as display only.</P>
 <P>Support registry entries are now available that will enable specific fields to be marked as disabled or required for specific record and journal viewers. Please contact your support representative for details. </P>
 <H2>1.11 Copystamp Bitmap</H2>
 <P>The Copystamp bitmap is now positioned correctly in PDF files.</P>
 <H2>1.12 User-Defined Reporting (User Report 2)</H2>
 <P>Affects mostly reports that are designed for the express purposed of being Exported/Save as CSV. Prior to this modification a layout that was known not to fit on the printable page was &quot;allowed&quot; but there was a limit of 350 characters that could be defined on a line (even if the goal was to export the output)...this is overcome by this modification.</P>
 <P><FONT style="font-weight:bold; " >Changed  Field: Sign Control</FONT></P>
 <P>This release changes the default behavior of the Sign Control field. Previously, a value '-' resulted in a trailing sign. Now, a value of '-' results in a leading sign.</P>
 <P>As before, a blank value will result in a trailing sign.&nbsp;</P>
 <H2>1.13 Display informative error message if User does not have access to Java</H2>
 <P>If a user does not have access to the java runtime program required for generating pdf’s, display the error message &quot;Error: you do not have access to the Java runtime.  See your system administrator.&quot; This message will replace the smalltalk error that previously appeared. </P>
 <H2>1.14 View Report Button on second row of button bar</H2>
 <P>Corrects an error that occurred when the user clicked the View Reports button on the second row of the Top Button Bar the following viewers: Folders Viewer, and on the Menus of Viewers, Reports, and Starters. </P>
 <H2>1.15 ReportAnywhere Scheduler</H2>
 <P>The system no longer includes the date/time on the filename if Overwrite is selected. In previous releases, if you scheduled a report to repeat and check the &quot;Save Report File&quot; and &quot;Overwrite Existing Report&quot; boxes the system still tagged a unique user id-date-time to the report file name effectively preventing the overwrite option. </P>
 <H2>1.16 Right Click Functionality</H2>
 <P>The fix corrects a problem that occurred when opening viewers with upper tab – if you switched from record to another, the record ID was not refreshed correctly.</P>
 <H2>1.17 Viewers Started at Form</H2>
 <P>If a viewer is set to start at the form – and you go directly from the form to the list, the default range settings were being ignored.  This has been fixed so that the auto-loaded ranges are applied.</P>
 <H2>1.18 Sidebar Print List button</H2>
 <P>The report that is generated from a viewer's sidebar 'Print List' button did not take into account any row reordering that has been performed as a consequence of the clicking of a column title. With this fix, the report itself mirrors what appears on the list view when the report is run. </P>
 <H2>1.19  Journal viewers</H2>
 <P><FONT style="font-weight:bold; " >Change Field: Next Id</FONT></P>
 <P>When you select the Closed filter on a Journal listing, the Next Id range is now automatically set to = so that only the final JE appears for Closed entries.</P>
 <P>Note that Deleted entries will not appear on a Closed listing because their Next Id is set to ‘Deleted’.  To view only Deleted entries, enter Deleted in the Next Id range, clear the other ranges, and click the Filter Records button to display the list. </P>
 <P><FONT style="font-weight:bold; " >Journal Viewers that use tack numbers</FONT><FONT style="font-weight:bold; " > (Labor, AP, etc.)</FONT></P>
 <P>This release corrects a problem where the transaction number was reset after a warning message if a required field was not completed. </P>
 <H2>1.20 Windows Vista and SAM Pro Help</H2>
 <P>As of this date, Windows Vista does not include a viewer for the most common type of help files, used since the release of Windows 95. Programs such as SAM Pro using these help files will display an error message when you try to access the Help System unless a special Help patch has been installed.  This patch is available as an installer; contact your support representative if you have experienced this problem.</P>
 <H2>1.21 Notes</H2>
 <P>If the Delete button on a Note’s parent viewer is clicked, its Notes will only be deleted if the parent record is also deleted.</P>
 <P>Word Wrap has been implemented in user Notes so text will no longer scroll off the side of the screen. Word Wrap will automatically accommodate the text when the Notes viewer is resized. </P>
 <H2>1.22  BlackBerry Device Licensing</H2>
 <P>Technician records are now configured for PDA usage by setting the Remote Device Type to 'CE' on the Technician viewer’s Web Access tab. The number of active technicians with this setting cannot exceed the value your firm is licensed for  </P>
 <H2>1.23 Document Archive Maintenance</H2>
 <P>This function helps to implement archiving for installations that didn't archive from the beginning of SAMPRO or where archiving errors occurred.&nbsp; This process attempts to bring the document management data up-to-date based on current archiving technology.&nbsp; Please contact your support represented for additional information. </P>
 <P>Note that this version also corrects a problem with multi-page attachments archiving.</P>
 <H2>1.24 Emailing PDF files</H2>
 <P>When a user emails a report as a pdf attachment, the pdf is now saved to the directory specified in the dbreportfiles registry entry instead of the base SAM Pro directory. </P>
 <H2>1.25  Spell Check</H2>
 <P>Spell checking functionality may now be enabled in your system. Contact your support representative for details.  </P>
 <P>Note that Spell Checking is disabled when processes are running in Data Emulation mode. This change was made to avoid problems with TechAnywhere updates to work orders. </P>
 <P>This enhancement provides Spell Checking for the contents of selected fields. Spell checking is implemented when the user exits the field. The spell checker then checks the spelling of the field contents. No visible action is taken if the field passes this test.</P>
 <P>If the field fails the preliminary spelling check, a Spell Check Dialog Box is displayed. This box allows the user to accept or correct the spelling or to add words to the Lexicon maintained on your system. </P>
 <P>When the Spell Check Dialog Box is exited, the field contents are set to the corrected value. If the user Cancels the Spell Check Dialog Box, the field contents are left unchanged.</P>

 <H2>1.26 Report Printing</H2>
 <P>Corrects ‘Page 0 does not exist’ message when printing directly to printer (without previewing first). </P>
 <H2>1.27 Copy and Paste </H2>
 <P>The code to copy the contents of SAM Pro fields to the clipboard did not do the required clearing of the Window’s clipboard first. This has been fixed. In addition, the system now trims trailing blanks from the contents of the field before copying the contents to the clipboard. </P>
 <H2>1.28 Viewer Display Problem – WO and possibly other viewers with Child tabs </H2>
 <P>This corrects a problem that occurred after validation detected a problem. When the child tabs were redisplayed after the message was confirmed, they appeared to be in the wrong order.</P>
 <H2>1.29 SAM Pro Logon Exit</H2>
 <P>Corrects ‘datasource not found’ error message on clicking Cancel button in the Log On screen. </P>
 <H2>1.30 Document Scanning Wizard</H2>
 <P>This enhancement adds the ability to set the Document Description field from the Scan wizard. This involves an additional step when the scanning is finished to allow the user to enter the field.</P>
 <H2>1.31 State / Province Field in Addresses</H2>
 <P>By default, data entry in the State / Province address field is limited to the official abbreviations of the US States and Canadian Provinces. By implementing one of the registry entries discussed in user note 2.16 you may add additional abbreviations for country, specify the specific codes allowed, or disable the code validations. </P>
 <H2>1.32 Work Order and Other Viewers</H2>
 <P>Corrects a sporadic data problem that sometimes occurred when accessing an open Work Order from the Dispatch Board. This problem only occurred  if: one of the list view Work Order panes was displayed (e.g., Invoices, TechStatus, etc.) AND the Work Order viewer was  already open.  This fix also extends to other viewers and viewer combinations (e.g., using the Project Manager viewer to access the Job).&nbsp; </P>
 <H1>2 Registry</H1>
 <H2>2.0 GL Entity Validation for Journal Entries via Registry Settings </H2>
 <P>These registry options enable the user to require that the GL entity be specified when the GL Account is a specific type (i.e. income or expense) or denied for Balance Sheet accounts in the Journals that you specify.&nbsp; They may be implemented as a warning or hard-stop error on a journal by journal basis.</P>

 <P style="margin-top:0;margin-bottom:0">&nbsp;</P>
 <H2>2.2  New Option for Work Order Viewer (sys-viewer-vwrkordr)</H2>
 <H3>Option to Import Employer PR Tax Costs Into Work Order </H3>
 <P><FONT style="font-weight:bold; " >ImportPRCheckFromJCH=true<BR></FONT>If this option is implemented, the Employer portion of PR Taxes (FUTA, FICA, etc) will be imported to the WorkOrder (as part of the Import Costs functionality) from the Payroll Check Journal. This enables all costs to be viewable on the Gross Margin tab of the workorder.&nbsp; Note that these costs will be imported without any revenue.&nbsp;</P>
 <H3>Entry control for preventing use of Completed Cost Codes and Billing Items </H3>
 <P>Currently, the system warns you if you enter a billing item or job cost code whose Date Completed exceeds the effective transaction date. These new options change the current warning to an error for the following, on either a global basis or on a viewer by viewer basis. It's also important to note that the validation logic implemented by this registry entry only applies when either a Cost Code Id or a Billing Item Id field's value is explicitly changed by the data entry user.&nbsp; </P>
 <P><FONT style="font-weight:bold; " >CostCodeDateCompletedValidation=error<BR>BillingItemDateCompletedValidation=error<BR></FONT></P>
 <P>The Cost Code and Billing Item registry entries are independent from one another.&nbsp; Each is controlled by its own registry option.  Alternately, this option may be implementing on a more global basis in sys-ffv-global-settings. </P>
 <H3>Registry Entry to load WO Inventory GL Entity</H3>
 <P style="margin-left:36.00pt;"><FONT style="font-weight:bold; " >Contents: ResetINVEntities=true<BR></FONT>It the GL Entity Id is a required field for WO-INV lines, the validation is inadvertently triggered during the record load.&nbsp; This means that every WO already entered without the appropriate GL Entities displays the required fields error message. Adding the registry setting noted above will cause the blank entities to get reset with the entity from the cost code. The user will be warned to save the work order to retain the updated gl entities.</P>
 <H3>Deny WO Other Costs</H3>
 <P>WO Other was never intended to post to GL.&nbsp; However, for users attempting to match GL to JC, costs entered automatically cause a discrepancy. To prevent costs from being entered directly on the WO other tab, the following via registry entry option may be implemented:<BR><BR><FONT style="font-weight:bold; " >RestrictWOOtherCost=true</FONT></P>
 <P>The use of Unit Cost and Extended Cost is restricted to Quote lines when this registry option is turned on.&nbsp; These fields were already restricted for PO and JCH imports.</P>
 <P style="margin-top:0;margin-bottom:0">&nbsp;</P>
 <H2>2.3 New Options for New Call (sys-newcall)</H2>
 <H3>New Call 2 Options</H3>
 <P><FONT style="font-weight:bold; " >SiteSearchNew=true&nbsp;<BR></FONT>If this option is enabled, the new Site Search screen (New Call 2) will initially appear when New Call is started.  Users will be able to toggle between this screen and the original New Call by clicking the New Call / New Call 2 buttons. </P>
 <P><FONT style="font-weight:bold; " >AutoFindForFields=</FONT><FONT style="font-weight:bold; font-style:italic; " >field1,field2, ...<BR></FONT>This option simulates the push of the Find Site button after user-specified search criteria fields have been changed and the specified field or fields tabbed out of.  These fields are specified as a comma-delimited list of one or more of the search criteria field names.&nbsp; The full list of eligible fields is as follows...</P>
 <P style="margin-left:36.00pt;">nwcll.addrss-strt<BR>nwcll.addrss-strt-2<BR>nwcll.zp-cde<BR>nwcll.phne<BR>nwcll.ste-nme<BR>nwcll.cntct-nme-frst<BR>nwcll.cntct-nme-lst<BR></P>
 <P style="margin-left:36.00pt;"><FONT style="font-weight:bold; text-decoration:underline;" >Example:</FONT></P>
 <P style="margin-left:36.00pt;">AutoFindForFields=nwcll.addrss-strt,nwcll.addrss-strt-2<BR><BR>In the above example, the two street address fields are named.&nbsp; With this registry setting, any change to either of the address fields would simulate a push of the Find Site button. Note that these search fields will look in any of the 4 street address lines in the Site record. </P>
 <P style="margin-left:36.00pt;"><FONT style="font-weight:bold; " >AutoFindForFields=All<BR></FONT>This is a special case of the previous option. Implementing it would be the equivalent of naming each field in the registry entry.</P>
 <H3>Display Site Billing Comments</H3>
 <P style="margin-left:36.00pt;"><FONT style="font-weight:bold; " >PromptBillingComments=true</FONT></P>
 <P style="margin-left:36.00pt;">Implementing this option will make Client Site Billing Comments pop up after the A/R Aging screen when a Client Site is selected during New Call.</P>
 <H3>Restore Default Method of Caching Prompts</H3>
 <P style="margin-left:36.00pt;"><FONT style="font-weight:bold; " >ClearCacheAfterWOCreate=false </FONT></P>
 <P style="margin-left:36.00pt;">The new option is a way to preserve old behavior related to the caching of the various prompts issued for Credit Hold, Aged AR, Equipment Under Warranty, etc.&nbsp; The New Call process is aware of previously issued prompts and attempts to avoid redundancies using a caching mechanism.&nbsp; Prior to this case, the cache was cleared when the Refresh button was pushed or when New Call was re-started.&nbsp; With this version, SAM Pro clears the cache after each successful WO creation.&nbsp; This option restores the old behavior. </P>
 <H2>2.4  New Option for AP Journal Registry Entry (sys-viewer-vapjrnl)</H2>
 <H3>WO Billing / PWP  Arrangements</H3>
 <P>This registry option concerns you if you use Service Invoicing for WO billing and have PWP arrangements with your subs.&nbsp; In previous builds, upon completion of the WO, an AR Invoice could not be generated with the sub's charges until the Vendor Invoice has been recorded in AP.&nbsp; In this enhancement, the AR Invoice Id has been added to the AP Journal child tables.&nbsp; During Vendor Invoice entry, the user may specify an AR Invoice Id to attach to the JCH entries, making it appear as though the charges have already been billed.&nbsp; In cases where the sub PO was issued for a single WO and that WO has appeared on an AR Invoice, advise the user and preset the new field to the associated AR Invoice Id. Specifically:</P>
 <P class="Reference_Line" style="margin-bottom:0.00pt;">1. When the APJ PO Id is entered, the PO is read to determine its WO Id.<BR>2. If the PO has a WO Id, the JCH is queried to determine if the WO has been invoiced.<BR>3. If the WO has been invoiced, the new logic is activated.<BR><BR>Conversely, if the APJ entry has no PO or the PO has no WO or the WO hasn't been invoiced, then the new logic is not activated. The following registry option is available to adjust the new behavior:<BR><BR><FONT style="font-weight:bold; " >AttachCostsToARInvoiceForWO</FONT><FONT style="font-weight:bold; font-style:italic; " >=always</FONT><FONT style="font-style:italic; " >  </FONT><FONT style="text-decoration:underline;" >or</FONT><FONT style="font-style:italic; " > </FONT><FONT style="font-weight:bold; font-style:italic; " >never</FONT><FONT style="font-style:italic; " >  </FONT><FONT style="text-decoration:underline;" >or</FONT><FONT style="font-style:italic; " >  </FONT><FONT style="font-weight:bold; font-style:italic; " >prompt</FONT></P>
 <P class="Reference_Line" style="margin-bottom:0.00pt;">The default behavior is '<FONT style="font-weight:bold; " >always</FONT>'.&nbsp; This means that, whenever possible, the A/R Invoice Id should be set automatically. This behavior will occur if no registry entry is made.</P>
 <P class="Reference_Line" style="margin-bottom:0.00pt;">Setting the option to '<FONT style="font-weight:bold; " >prompt</FONT>' means that the user will be informed that an A/R invoice for the WO exists and gives them the option of attaching it to the AP Journal costs.</P>
 <P class="Reference_Line" style="margin-bottom:0.00pt;">Setting the option to '<FONT style="font-weight:bold; " >never</FONT>' means that the previous SAMPRO behavior can be restored.&nbsp; In other words, the user will never know this change was implemented.</P>
 <H3>Entry control for preventing use of Completed Cost Codes and Billing Items </H3>
 <P>Currently, the system warns you if you enter a billing item or job cost code whose Date Completed exceeds the effective transaction date. These new options change the current warning to an error for the following, on either a global basis or on a viewer by viewer basis. It's also important to note that the validation logic implemented by this registry entry only applies when either a Cost Code Id or a Billing Item Id field's value is explicitly changed by the data entry user.&nbsp; </P>
 <P><FONT style="font-weight:bold; " >Contents:</FONT></P>
 <P><FONT style="font-weight:bold; " >&nbsp;CostCodeDateCompletedValidation=error<BR>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;BillingItemDateCompletedValidation=error<BR></FONT></P>
 <P>The Cost Code and Billing Item registry entries are independent from one another.&nbsp; Each is controlled by its own registry option.  Alternately, this option may be implementing on a more global basis in sys-ffv-global-settings. </P>
 <H2><BR>2.5  New Option for Compute Payroll (sys-compute-payroll)</H2>

 <P class="Normal_Indent" ><FONT style="font-weight:bold; " >WageExpenseAccountFromCostCategory=true<BR></FONT>This entry implements the optional use of the Job Cost Category GL Expense Account as a Wage Expense Account for Payroll purposes. </P>
 <H3>Ignore GL Entity for PR Tax Liabilities</H3>
 <P>If this option is implemented, the GL Entity (typically specified in the Tax Authority record) will be ignored for PR Tax liabilities written when the Compute Payroll function is run. Note that the GL Entity will still be written to the PR Tax Expense entry when payroll is computed.</P>

 <H3>JCH Descriptions</H3>
 <P>This release supports is an enhancement to the concept of posting allocated P/R taxes, fringes, etc. at the time check posting with the addition to the JobCostPR Checks box to the Earnings viewer.&nbsp; Prior to this change, the resulting JCH entries had no description.&nbsp; This change allows specification of descriptions for the different types allocated P/R expenses.&nbsp; ..<BR><BR><FONT style="font-weight:bold; " >Contents:<BR>&nbsp; AllocatedFringesDescription=</FONT><FONT style="font-weight:bold; font-style:italic; " >{description for JCH}<BR></FONT><FONT style="font-weight:bold; " >&nbsp; AllocatedTaxesDescription=</FONT><FONT style="font-weight:bold; font-style:italic; " >{description for JCH}<BR></FONT><FONT style="font-weight:bold; " >&nbsp; AllocatedWorkersCompDescription=</FONT><FONT style="font-weight:bold; font-style:italic; " >{description for JCH}<BR></FONT><FONT style="font-weight:bold; " >&nbsp; AllocatedLiabilityInsuranceDescription=</FONT><FONT style="font-weight:bold; font-style:italic; " >{description for JCH}</FONT><FONT style="font-weight:bold; " ><BR></FONT><BR>The AllocatedTaxesDescription also supports a replacement token that can include the Tax Table Id in the description.&nbsp; An example is ... PR Taxes ^TableId^<BR><BR>Note that the ^TableId^ token is case-sensitive.</P>
 <H3>Specify a Payroll Expense Account</H3>
 <P>This option allows the allocated PR expenses to be associated with original JCH cost categories but using a different GL Expense Debit account. This overrides the Cost Category G/L Expense Account found in the Job Cost Category. This registry entry should be used with caution as it lumps all PR Expenses into one GL Account.</P>

 <H2>(sys-web-access-technician)</H2>
 <P class="Reference_Line" style="margin-bottom:0.00pt;">If you add a technician line to a work order, the&nbsp;system will look to the registry entry for that web access type of technician (typically, sys-web-access-technician) to see if the NewWorkOrderStatus= option is set (generally, it would be set to pending). If so, the status of the new line will default to the status specified in the NewWorkOrderStatus option, just as if a new work order has been created for the technician. In previous versions, when a new tech line was added to a work order, the status would default to the default status for that work order (unless overridden by the DefaultStatus option).</P>

 <H3>Set Initial Sequence Number of PM’s</H3>
 <P><FONT style="font-weight:bold; " >&nbsp;DefaultCallSequence=900&nbsp;</FONT></P>
 <P>This registry option enables you to set the initial sequence number of PM Work orders that controls positioning on the Classic Board. It results in new PM’s appearing below the more sensitive Service WO’s on the Classic Board. It also allows for facilitated processing in the following example: </P>
 <P style="margin-left:36.00pt;">At 8:00 am a user creates Group A of PM WorkOrders.</P>
 <P style="margin-left:36.00pt;">At 9:00 am they bring Group A up using the classic board. The WO's would now show in WO id Order. Then they assign some WO’s to other Techs. The call sequence numbers on the rest of Group A would be assigned by the classic board from 1 to the number of WOs in the group.</P>
 <P style="margin-left:36.00pt;">At 10:00 am they create Group B of PM WorkOrders.</P>
 <P style="margin-left:36.00pt;">At 11:00 am they bring up the Classic Dispatch Board. If this registry entry is not set, all WOs in Group B would have 0 call sequence numbers, which means they would display above Group A since this group had call sequence numbers assigned. With this registry all of group B's WOs would display below group A.</P>
 <H3>Set customer’s PO on PM WorkOrders </H3>
 <P>You may use <FONT style="text-decoration:underline;" >one</FONT> of the following options to assign the WO PO from site or job based on registry when Create PM Workorders is run.</P>

 <P>In the second option, specify a Cost Category Id to be used with the Other Items on the PM Parts list. </P>
 <H3>Create one WO per PM Schedule line</H3>
 <P>If this registry option is implemented, the Start Create PM Work Order function will generate a separate work order for each line of the Client Site Equipment PM schedule. This registry option may result in a large number of work orders, since the system will not combine multiple tasks for the same date and technician. </P>

 <P>If this registry option is set to No, AND the Technician is not a Sub, flagged Service Parts will not be used to create quoted lines on the PM Work Order.</P>
 <P>If this registry option is set to Sub, AND the Technician is not a Sub, handle flagged Service Parts using the subcontractor processing (that writes these parts to the Work Requested).</P>
 <P>If this registry option is set to Yes or is not present, use the default processing that flagged Service Parts are used to create quoted lines on the PM Work Order.</P>
 <H3>Option to set Job Cost Category of Flagged PM Parts</H3>
 <P>If flagged parts from the PM's parts list are written to the Inventory or Other tabs (if the TechServiceParts=Yes or this option is absent), the following registry option enables you to select a default job cost category for each of these.&nbsp;</P>

 <P>In the first option, specify a Cost Category Id to be used with the Inventory Items on the PM Parts list.</P>
 <P>In the second option, specify a Cost Category Id to be used with the Other Items on the PM Parts list. </P>
 <H3>Do not Mark Contract Value Entries as Quoted Lines</H3>
 <P>This registry option would be only used if the user actually puts budgets in the system for their PM jobs.&nbsp; On Time of Service PM’s, the QU and Extra boxes are checked when the work order is generated resulting in the budget to be overstated.&nbsp;The following registry option turn off the QU flag when generating Time of service PM work orders so that an additional budget entry will not be made.</P>

This restores the system’s previous default behavior which was changed in version 7.0</P>
 <P>Note that NO changes were made to the way non-fixed fee Jobs work... users must continue to mark these 'ready to invoice' for them to appear in Record Billing Adjustment (e.g., Time&amp;Material Change Orders).&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</P>
 <H3>Registry Entry to Save Scanned Documents as PDF’s</H3>

 <H2>2.29 New Registry Entry for Start Create EOM Unvouchered AP GL Entries (sys-start-seomunvchrdap)</H2>
 <P>Prior to this release, the EOM-UVP function posted all debits and credits at the PO line item detail level.&nbsp; This wasn't really necessary for the Credits and caused the resulting GL Journal entries to have nearly double the number of lines necessary to accurately reflect UVP dollars.

 <H3>Option to Enable Auto-loading of Location / GL Entity From Technician record</H3>
 <P>In previous releases, the Location and GL Entity fields in the Client Site COP tab were over ridden when a Technician was entered on the Contacts tab. This could cause problems for a company running COP because it would mean that a service-related field (technician) would impact COP related fields (Location and GL Entity on the COP tab). The default behavior has been changed so that entering or changing the Technician does not effect the Location and GL Entity fields unless the following registry option is implemented:</P>
 <P><FONT style="font-weight:bold; " >Contents/ Additional Contents: LocationFromTechnician=true</FONT></P>
 <H2>2.31 New Registry Option for Start Create PM Billing (sys-start-scrtepmbllng)</H2>

 <P>Warning: implementing this for PM Invoice Workorders may result in the work requested effectively printing twice - depending on the invoice format that you select. </P>
 <H2>2.32 Registry Entry Quotemaster – Allow Closed WO’s  (sys-viewer-vqte)</H2>
 <P><FONT style="font-weight:bold; " >Contents: AllowClosedWO=true</FONT></P>
 <P>The registry option basically allows the user to reference a Closed WO in the Quote. If this option is not implemented,  the Quote viewer's validation code denies use of any WO that has an Escalation Status of Completed, Invoice Ready, Billed, Invoice Review or Credit Hold.&nbsp; With the new registry entry (AllowClosedWO=true), the list of rejected Escalation Status values is reduced to Credit Hold. </P>
 <P>The Quote Approval wizard requires the use of the New WO option when the Quote's main WO is a closed WO. Under no circumstances should the Quote Approval Wizard allow the user to select a closed WO.</P>

 <H2>2.35 New Call Pop-up when Work Orders exceed limit</H2>

 <P style="margin-left:36.00pt;">If the registry entry is not present, the system will use the user defined report RRALST. Note that the standard  report (RRALST.rpt) or the custom report referenced in the registry entry must be installed for this function to work properly in this version.</P>
 <H2>2.38  Registry Entry to Enable DBXchange Document Processing </H2>
 <P>This functionality enables you to ‘push’ certain documents to a specified location where they are accessible for TechAnywhere, CRMAnywhere and CSRAnywhere users. This would typically be on your firm’s DMZ in order to handle firewall considerations.  Please contact your support representative for details on implementing this functionality. </P>
 <H2>2.39  New Registry Option for Service Compute Invoices (sys-report-serviceinvoice)</H2>
 <H3>Inventory Description – Set from Pricing Code Only</H3>
 <P><FONT style="font-weight:bold; " >ShowOnlyInvntryDesc=Yes</FONT></P>
 <P>The system now sets the work order inventory description using the Price Code (if the description is completed) and the Inventory Price Exceptions tables (shown on the Inventory Item Pricing tab).  The following registry option enables you to only include the Inventory Description on service compute invoices – it is designed for companies that do not want the internal part name to appear on customer invoices. Note that the Description defaults from the Inventory Name if there is no Price Code or the description in the Price Code is blank.</P>
 <H2>2.40 Registry Entry for Renew Service Contracts</H2>
 <P>The Start Renew Service Contract function advances the Job Date Closed (if set) by one year. This function was also advancing the Job Date Open field by one year, which most clients felt was undesirable. With this release, only the Date Closed (if initially set) is adjusted by default. </P>
 <P>The following registry setting enables users to re-implement advancement of the Job Date Opened when Renew Service Contract is run.</P>
 <P><FONT style="font-weight:bold; " >Id: sys-start-srnwsrvcecntrct </FONT></P>
 <P><FONT style="font-weight:bold; " >Contents: AdvanceJobDateOpened=true</FONT></P>
 <P>If this option is specified, then the Job date opened will be advanced 1 year. The default is not to advance the job date opened.</P>
 <H2>2.41 Registry Entry for Start Scheduled Event Purge</H2>
 <P>See user notes 9.18 for details on a change to the default behavior of this function and registry entries. </P>
 <H2>2.42 Last Page Bitmaps for Selected Reports (sys-report-<FONT style="font-weight:normal; font-style:italic; " >reportfunctionid</FONT>)</H2>
 <P>This registry enhancement may be used to print a ‘backer’ type bitmap as the last page of selected reports. <FONT style="font-style:italic; text-decoration:underline;" >Currently this feature is available only on the PO Form and standard Quote Form reports.&nbsp; This new functionality can be added to other section-based reports as needed.&nbsp; A relatively small amount of change is required. </FONT></P>
 <P>The general form of the registry entry that implements the new behavior is as follows...</P>
 <P>Id: sys-report-<FONT style="font-style:italic; " >reportfunctionid</FONT><BR>Contents: sectionbackerbitmap<FONT style="font-style:italic; " >=sharepath\backerbitmap</FONT><FONT style="font-style:italic; " >name</FONT><FONT style="font-style:italic; " >.bmp</FONT></P>
 <P>If you will be emailing the report or saving it as a .pdf, make sure that a .jpg version of the backer bitmap also exists in the same directory. </P>
 <H2>2.43 Enhanced Standard Construction (AIA-Style) Billing </H2>
 <H2>Purpose:</H2>
 <P>SAM Pro now supports the printing of standard construction (AIA-style) invoices using a bitmap (form) background on plain paper. By setting up the appropriate user-defined functions and registry entries, you will be able to generate invoices to be distributed to the Owner, Purchaser and Construction Manager. </P>
 <H2>Initial Setup:</H2>
 <P><FONT style="font-weight:bold; " >1. SAM Pro Version</FONT></P>
 <P>You must be running a current version of SAM Pro version 7.0 or higher. </P>
 <P><FONT style="font-weight:bold; " >2. Import the Report</FONT></P>
 <P>If you have not already done so, import the updated raia.rpt (dated 6/052008 or later) into your database. </P>
 <P><FONT style="font-weight:bold; " >3. Create the User-Defined Functions </FONT></P>
 <P>You must create one user-defined function for each report version (Owner, Architect and Construction Manager) that you wish to print. These functions must all point at report raia.rpt. The reason that you need three of them is to that the appropriate bitmap back will be linked to each.</P>
 <P style="margin-left:36.00pt;"><FONT style="font-weight:bold; text-decoration:underline;" >Examples:</FONT></P>
 <P style="margin-left:36.00pt;">User Defined Function for Invoice Distributed to Owner:</P>

 <H2>2.44 Registry Entry Control for Extra Lines on COP Invoice</H2>
 <P>This new functionality for Smalltalk reports was implemented to correct a COP Invoice problem that occurred when 7 detail lines were printed and then the total lines were not hitting within the bitmap total box. The registryExtraLinesForView~orderitem=1 forces the 7<FONT style="vertical-align:super; " >th</FONT> line to the next page, resulting in the totals being positioned correctly. </P>

 <H2>2.46&nbsp;Outlook Email Support</H2>
 <P>This image, in conjunction with the XML2PDF.jar included with it, work together to re-implement Outlook support for SAM Pro email.  To implement or re-implement this option:</P>
 <P><FONT style="font-weight:bold; " >Registry Id:   sys-email</FONT></P>
 <P><FONT style="font-weight:bold; " >Contents: UseOutlook=true</FONT></P>
 <P>If this entry is present, processing of the outgoing e-mail is passed on to MS Outlook with the to-address, subject, message and attachments&nbsp;defaulted when applicable.</P>
 <P>When Outlook is implemented, the following will occur when you click the E-mail button on a SAM Pro report:</P>
 <P style="margin-left:36.00pt;">The Outlook e-mail form (not SAM Pro’s) will open.</P>
 <P style="margin-left:36.00pt;">The report that you generated will be attached in its default PDF format (or as set in the registry).</P>
 <P style="margin-left:36.00pt;">The From: line will be completed with the e-mail address from your Outlook profile.</P>
 <P style="margin-left:36.00pt;">The To: line will be completed with the default values (if any) that exist for this report.</P>
 <P style="margin-left:36.00pt;">The Subject line will be defaulted according to the report.</P>
 <P>When the Outlook form is up, you may add additional recipients from your Outlook address box, enter a text message, and include additional attachments.  When you click Send, a copy of the e-mail will remain in your Sent box if you have implemented this feature in Outlook. </P>

 <P>&nbsp;Wrong: W3Telephone=(216) 663-5600  </P>
 <P><FONT style="font-weight:bold; " >W3PrintEmployerAddress=No </FONT></P>
 <P>If present, this option turns off printing boxes e,f,g on the W3 that list the Employer’s EIN, Name and Address. This registry option should be set if a preprinted label will be used on the W3.</P>
 <H2>2.48 Reports Launched by Escalation Manager (sys-report-reportfunctionid)</H2>
 <P><FONT style="font-weight:bold; " >Escalation Manager Pagination Problem<BR></FONT>Since reports launched by the escalation manager do not know which printer they will be sent to, the default length was being set to 60 lines per page in some cases – much too short for a portrait report. This release has been enhanced so that the scheduled report manager will look at the LinesPerPage= option in the sys-report-reportfunctionid registry setting when calculating the lines per page. Typically, somewhere between 78 and 80 lines would be appropriate for a portrait report.</P>
 <H2>2.49 Registry Entry for TechAnywhere Users (sys-report-rwolist) </H2>

 <H1>3 AP and Purchasing</H1>
 <H2>3.1 AP Date to Pay </H2>

 <H3>3.1.1  Range Screen</H3>
 <P><FONT style="font-weight:bold; " >Vendor Type Id:</FONT><BR>This new range field has been added to enable you to run this function according to the type of Vendor (e.g., subs, distributors, etc.).</P>

 <P>Corrects a validation problem in cases where the source journal's base transaction id has rolled over to a number requiring more digits (for example, if Subcontractor POs were created with numbers that match the WO Id  some PO’s were 5 digits and others 6). </P>
 <P>The user is now able to clear the Job Id in the PO header.</P>
 <P>The user is now prevented from entering a Template job in the Job Id header or on individual PO lines. </P>
 <P>Corrects problem where Entity did not default from Job if WO Id was entered on line (not header).</P>
 <P>Print PO Form now excludes PO’s with a status of Unreleased. </P>
 <P>PO’s with statuses of Cancelled and Closed are now excluded from the Active Purchase Order list. This changes previous behavior where the Date Closed had to be completed to exclude PO’s from the list. </P>
 <P><FONT style="font-weight:bold; " >Calculating Revenue with Margin, Markup and Multiplier</FONT></P>
 <P>In previous releases, if you used a Bill Type of Margin, Markup, or Multiplier the system didn’t react to the quantity billed being zero and still extended out the revenue based on the actual quantity. The code now forces the Extended Revenue to zero whenever the Bill Quantity is set to zero. The Extended Revenue may then be changed to a non-zero value if needed. This change effects revenue calculations in the AP Journal, Inventory Receipts Journal, Record Billing Adjustments, Job Journal, Labor Journal, Purchase Order, Quote and Worker Order viewers. </P>
 <P style="text-indent:5.75pt;"><FONT style="font-weight:bold; " >Date Closed:<BR></FONT>   The PO's Date Closed to the system date whenever the PO's Status is set to Closed.</P>

 <P>The PO viewer now denies the use of credit-hold WOs on both the parent form and all child panes; the user will be notified that a user with Credit Manager privileges must remove the Credit Hold flag from the Work Order. Note that although PO’s will be automatically be generated for Subcontractor Technicians, they may not be edited until the associated WO is taken off Credit Hold.</P>
 <P><FONT style="font-weight:bold; " >Changed Field:</FONT></P>

 <H3>3.2.2 General Tab</H3>
 <P>The user is now warned if a General Tab PO line is 'unreceived' after it has been imported into a work order. If the user changes the quantity received, the system will display the message:</P>
 <P style="margin-left:36.00pt;">Warning: this line was imported in Work Order ######</P>
 <P style="margin-left:36.00pt;">Are you sure you want to change the received quantity?</P>
 <P>It the user answers ‘Yes’, the box will clear. If he answers ‘No’, an information box will appear asking him to press Shift-Home to restore the original value. </P>
 <P><FONT style="font-weight:bold; " >Other Rate</FONT><FONT style="font-weight:bold; " ><BR></FONT>In previous releases, if<FONT style="font-weight:bold; " > </FONT>a user changed the Other Rate Id, it changed the associated Cost Category but not the related GL account.

 <H3>3.2.3 Status Tab</H3>
 <P><FONT style="font-weight:bold; " > N</FONT><FONT style="font-weight:bold; " >ew Button: Reopen Closed PO’s <BR></FONT>A new button has been added to the Status tab labeled Reopen Closed PO.&nbsp; </P>
 <P style="margin-left:36.00pt;">1. The button is only available for use on PO's with status of Closed.<BR>2. The 're-opened' status will be either Released or Printed.&nbsp; The determination is made by evaluating the status of the PO's lines.&nbsp; If any one of them is marked Printed, then the re-open status is Printed.&nbsp; Otherwise, the re-open status is Released.<BR>3. The Date Closed is reset to 1900-01-01.<BR>4. The viewer will be refreshed after the button is pushed and the PO has been re-opened.<BR>5. An entry is added to the Record Change Log will show that the re-open button was pushed.</P>
 <H3>3.2.4 Shipping Address Tab </H3>
 <P>The Worksite option has been enhanced to also work if a Job Id has been entered in the PO Header (in previous releases, this functionality was only enabled if a Work Order Id was entered). Now, if Worksite is selected, the system will default in the address from the Client Site referenced in the job. </P>
 <P style="margin-top:0;margin-bottom:0">&nbsp;</P>
 <H2>3.3 AP Journal Viewer</H2>
 <P>This release corrects a problem where, if a work order that had not been invoiced was referenced on a po, and there was no job cost history, the AR Invoice Id was set to 0 instead of to blank. This caused problems invoicing the work order. </P>
 <P>This release includes an SQL Server Performance Enhancement when entering the PO Id. </P>
 <P>The GL Entity is now correctly retrieved when an AP Journal entry is accessed for editing. </P>
 <P>A Diagnostic Alert will appear in this journal if the system detects a potentially unbalanced post. Note that the entry will not be saved, and should be re-entered.  This release also corrects false positive alert that occurred when a previously entered GEN line was edited. This validation also supports retainage amounts entered on the Inventory, Sub, and General tabs. </P>
 <P>Corrects false positive diagnostic alert error that occurred when a PO with general items with quantities extending to 3 digits to the right of the decimal point were vouchered. </P>
 <P>If the focus is on the Discount Amount in the header, the Discount now calculates properly when the transaction is saved.</P>
 <P>The Change Log has been added to Tools menu.</P>
 <P>The Discount Amount now correctly reduces when lines are deleted. </P>
 <P>The Total Discount is now correctly calculated when editing an entry that was initially made with a non-discount AP Terms and changed to an AP Terms with discounts. </P>
 <P>Software now checks for duplicate vendor/invoice when the vendor is entered. It was only checking when invoice was entered.</P>
 <P>The user is once again permitted to manually back date the Discount Date and Date to Pay fields that the system sets automatically from the Effective Date and AP Terms record. An exception to this is if the Discount Percent is a non-zero amount but the Discount Amount is zero. In this case, the dates will be reset on saving the entry. </P>
 <P>The AP Journal Viewer now deletes any Client Order to Ship entries for a transaction when that transaction is deleted.</P>
 <P><FONT style="font-weight:bold; " >Materials Return Tab:</FONT>  <BR>Corrects assorted problems related to returning job/wo related items.</P>
 <P><FONT style="font-weight:bold; " >Changed Field - Vendor Id:<BR></FONT>The system will now display a warning if you enter an inactive vendor Id.</P>
 <H3>3.3.1  EFT / Credit Card Recording (Manual Check section)</H3>
 <P>You may now record EFT and direct credit card payments in the AP Journal. <FONT style="font-family:'Tahoma'; color:black; " >EFT/Credit transactions will appear in the Clear Check / Bank Reconciliation functions for clearing.</FONT> </P>
 <P class="Tip_Note_Heading" style="margin-top:4.00pt;">New Fields:</P>
 <P><FONT style="font-weight:bold; " >Payment Type:  Check   EFT   CR/DB Card<BR></FONT>This field will initially default to Check (for Manual Checks).  To record a CR/DB Card or EFT payment, select the appropriate option by clicking on the adjacent radio button. </P>
 <P><FONT style="font-weight:bold; " >EFT/Credit Trx Id:<BR></FONT>If you selected a payment type of EFT or CR/DB Card, this field may be used to record the electronic transaction or confirmation number. However, if a Payment Type other than 'Check' is selected and the EFT/Credit Trx Id is blank, then it will default it from the APJ Trx Id during the add process.</P>
 <P class="Reference_Line" style="margin-bottom:0.00pt;">The following AP Journal validation rules apply to these new fields:</P>
 <P style="margin-left:36.00pt;">1. Don't allow entry of both a Check Number and EFT/Credit Trx Id.<BR>2. Check Number can only be used with Payment Type 'Check'.<BR>3. EFT/Credit Trx Id not allowed with Payment Type 'Check'.<BR>4. Treat EFT/Credit Trx Id similar to Check Number for existing validations. </P>
 <H3>3.3.2 Use Tax Liability Posting to GL Should not include an Entity</H3>
 <P class="Reference_Line" style="margin-bottom:0.00pt;">When vouchering a PO to a WO/Job that has use tax, the Debit to the tax liability account (defined by the tax group on the job) had an entity that was associated with the job cost category. This should not have an entity: the code has been changed so that only the GL account and not the entity posts.</P>
 <H3>3.3.3 WO Billing / PWP  Arrangements</H3>
 <P>This change concerns you if you use Service Invoicing for WO billing and have PWP arrangements with your subs.&nbsp; In previous builds, upon completion of the WO, an AR Invoice could not be generated with the sub's charges until the Vendor Invoice has been recorded in AP.&nbsp; In this enhancement, the AR Invoice Id has been added to the AP Journal child tables.&nbsp; During Vendor Invoice entry, the user may specify an AR Invoice Id to attach to the JCH entries, making it appear as though the charges have already been billed.&nbsp; In cases where the sub PO was issued for a single WO and that WO has appeared on an AR Invoice, advise the user and preset the new field to the associated AR Invoice Id. Specifically:</P>
 <P class="Reference_Line" style="margin-bottom:0.00pt;">1. When the APJ PO Id is entered, the PO is read to determine its WO Id.<BR>2. If the PO has a WO Id, the JCH is queried to determine if the WO has been invoiced.<BR>3. If the WO has been invoiced, the new logic is activated.</P>
 <P class="Reference_Line" style="margin-bottom:0.00pt;">This new behavior may be modified by the registry entry described in section 2.4 of these release notes, enable the system to never import the AR Invoice Id, or prompt the user for confirmation when doing so. </P>
 <H3>3.3.4  Returns Tab </H3>
 <P>Corrects error that occurred when a Job was selected on the Returns tab.</P>
 <H3>3.3.5 General Tab</H3>
 <P>Corrects problem where the use tax cost of partially received general items was calculated based on the total quantity ordered, instead of the quantity actually received. </P>
 <P><FONT style="font-weight:bold; " >Other Rate</FONT><FONT style="font-weight:bold; " ><BR></FONT>In previous releases, if<FONT style="font-weight:bold; " > </FONT>a user changed the Other Rate Id, it changed the associated Cost Category but not the related GL account. This problem has been corrected. </P>
 <P><FONT style="font-weight:bold; " >Job Cost Category<BR></FONT>In previous releases, if you entered a cost category in an entry with no PO, it defaulted the GL expense account. However, if you changed the cost category, it did not change the GL Account. This problem has been corrected so that the GL Account is defaulted from the new Cost Category if it is changed. </P>
 <H2>3.4  Cash Requirements Report – Vendor Qualification</H2>
 <P>When a vendor's entire outstanding balance is &quot;retainage&quot; the vendor and invoices do not qualify for inclusion on the report.&nbsp; Retainage only invoices did appear if ANY invoice for the vendors had a non-retainage outstanding balance – this problem has been corrected.</P>
 <H2>3.5 Start Void AP Checks</H2>
 <P>The software now includes a test for Manual Checks, and displays a message to address Manual Check Voids in the source AP Journal Trx. Voiding manual checks will, in effect, orphan the expense/liability created in the MANUAL CHECK AP Transaction, and should be avoided.</P>
 <H2>3.6 PO Reorder Advice Report</H2>
 <P>The PO Reorder Advice Report will exclude locations not specified for Reorder Advice reporting in the Location record. The ‘Include on Record Advice Report&quot; field in the Location record must be checked for a location to be included on this report. Note that this new field defaults to checked during data conversion. You may wish to clear the Include box for Truck locations. </P>
 <H2>3.7 Clear Check (Clear AP Check)</H2>
 <P>EFT and CR/DB card transactions are also supported in this release.</P>
 <H2>3.8 Vendor Viewer</H2>
 <P>Note that the 1099 Category, 1099-MISC and Federal Tax Id fields previously located on the Main Tab have been moved to the 1099 Tab.</P>
 <H3>3.8.1 – New Tab: 1099</H3>
 <P><FONT style="font-weight:bold; " >1099-MISC?</FONT> <BR>Check this box (by double-clicking on it or pressing Spacebar) if a 1099 form should be generated for this vendor (for example, for a subcontractor). When you do so, the Vendor’s Name will be used to default in the first 1099 Names line. </P>
 <P><FONT style="font-weight:bold; " >1099 Category</FONT> <BR>This field controls which box on the Vendor 1099 will be filled in:</P>

 <P style="text-indent:18.00pt;">The first line should be used for the &quot;Individual's Name&quot;.</P>
 <P style="text-indent:18.00pt;">The second line should be used for &quot;dba His Company Name&quot; or &quot;Individual, LLC&quot;<BR></P>
 <P style="margin-left:23.75pt;"><FONT style="text-decoration:underline;" >Example:<BR></FONT>Vendor Name: BJS Construction<BR><BR>May require:<BR>1099 Recipient Name: Brian Smith<BR>1099 Recipient Name2: Brian Smith dba BJs Construction<BR>-or- <BR>1099 Recipient Name2: BJs Construction, LLC<BR><BR>Though the &quot;dba name&quot; is optional, editing the Vendor Name is currently necessary to conform to 1099 requirements.&nbsp; And in the case of LLC's the 2nd naming line IS required.</P>
 <P class="Reference_Line" style="margin-bottom:0.00pt;">During data conversion, the Vendor Name will be used to populate the first 1099 Recipient field.</P>
 <P>Report Modification – the Vendor 1099 Reports has been modified to print these new fields.  Be sure that a 6.3/7.0 version of this report has been installed in your database. </P>
 <H2>3.9 Print PO Form</H2>
 <P>Extended descriptions of line items now print correctly.</P>
 <P>Print PO Form now excludes PO’s with a status of Unreleased. </P>
 <H2>3.10 Start Create EOM Unvouchered AP GL Entries</H2>
 <P>Corrects problem where costs of over 1,000,000 were being truncated.</P>
 <P>When this function is run, the system will now will attach the sidebar View Summary and Detail text files to the GL Journal transaction as document attachments. </P>
 <P>The Receipt Date of PO items has been added to the right-hand side of the checklist and the View Detail Report.</P>
 <P>Prior to this case, the EOM-UVP function posted all debits and credits at the PO line item detail level.&nbsp; This wasn't really necessary for the Credits and caused the resulting GL Journal entries to have nearly double the number of lines necessary to accurately reflect UVP dollars. The previous behavior with the credits also posted using GL Entities which isn't normal for Balance Sheet accounts. By default, credits will now be summarized and will not be posting using entities. You may control level of detail being posted as well as the handling of entities via the registry entries described in user notes 2.29. </P>
 <P><FONT style="font-weight:bold; " >Purchase Credit-type entries are no longer ignored by this function</FONT>, and will generate a negative debit to the Inventory Asset account. </P>
 <P>This case also corrects a problem that occurred if the registry entries that cause summarized EOM UVP postings are set, where the last PO processed ends up being associated with the summarized posting entries.&nbsp;</P>
 <P><FONT style="font-weight:bold; " >New Range: Closed<BR></FONT>By default, this field is set to 1900-01-01 so that only those POs with a blank Date Closed field will be included. This field should be cleared if all unvouchered POs should be included, regardless of whether or not the Date Closed has been set. </P>
 <H2>3.11 PWP Approved List</H2>
 <P>Corrects sporadic problem where PWP invoices did not appear on approval list due to identical invoice numbers for different vendors, one of which had not been&nbsp;paid. </P>
 <H2>3.12 Report Vendor 1099’s – (RAP1099.rpt)</H2>
 <P>This report corrects an error in the RAP1099.rpt for 7.0 that resulted in the Federal EIN not being pulled from the Tax Authority (of type Federal)<FONT style="font-weight:bold; font-style:italic; " > in the absence of the companyEINfederal registry setting</FONT>. The revised report is available for download for versions 7.0 and up.</P>
 <H2>3.13 Start Generate Purchase Order</H2>
 <P>Corrects an error that occurred when the system wrote the unit cost to IM history if the unit cost was entered on the checklist screen. Note that cost on the PO itself was generated correctly. </P>

 <H1>4 AR / Invoicing / Client, Site and Equipment</H1>
 <H2>4.1 Client Site Viewer</H2>
 <H3>4.1.1 Main Tab</H3>
 <P><FONT style="font-weight:bold; " >New Field: Template<BR></FONT>This field may not be set or cleared in the Client Site viewer; if checked, it indicates that it is a template record that was created for cloning purpose.  Template records may be viewed in the Client Site Viewer, but may not be edited, saved or deleted.  The new Client Site Templates viewer must be used to edit Template fields; this new feature is discussed in section 4.6 of these release notes. </P>
 <H3>4.1.2 New Tab- Lower Section: Contacts</H3>
 <P>The Contact tab enables you to attach one or more Contacts to a Site for informational and reporting purposes. </P>
 <H3>Important Fields:</H3>
 <P><FONT style="font-weight:bold; " >Contact Id:</FONT> <BR>Enter a valid Contact Id (or double-click to select from a list). You may create as may lines as needed to accommodate all contacts.  The display-only Name, Firm, Email and Phone number fields will default from the Contact record.  </P>
 <P><FONT style="font-weight:bold; " >Contact Type Id:</FONT> <BR>This optional field defaults from the Contact record but may be changed by the user if needed.  </P>
 <H3>4.1.3 Contacts Tab  (upper section) /   COP Tab</H3>
 <P><FONT style="font-weight:bold; " >Changed Field: Technician Id<BR></FONT>In previous releases, the Location and GL Entity fields in the Client Site COP tab were over ridden when a Technician was entered on the Contacts tab. This could cause problems for a company running COP because it would mean that a service-related field (technician) would impact COP related fields (Location and GL Entity on the COP tab). The default behavior has been changed so that entering or changing the Technician doe not effect the Location and GL Entity fields unless the registry option discussed in section 2.30 of these release notes is implemented.</P>
 <H3>4.1.4 PM Billing: Validation Rules for Line Changes</H3>
 <P>The system now looks at whether a line has been invoiced or had PM Earnings posted when determining what changes the user is allowed to make to the line: </P>
 <P style="margin-left:36.00pt;">a. If the line has been invoiced or have earnings posted, the Bill Date may NOT be changed. The OK to Renew field may be changed by the user regardless of the status of either of these fields. </P>
 <P style="margin-left:36.00pt;">b. If the line has been invoiced but not had earnings posted, changes are only allowed to the Amount Earned, GL Debit account, and OK to Renew fields.</P>
 <P style="margin-left:36.00pt;">c. If the line has had earnings posted but has not been invoiced, changes are only allowed to the Amount Billed, GL Credit account, and the OK to Renew fields. </P>
 <H2>4.2  Site Equipment Viewer</H2>
 <P>Site Equipment records that are attached to Client Site Template records may only be edited by users with access to Templates via their User Groups. </P>
 <P>The Site Equipment Name is no longer required to be unique for each site.&nbsp; </P>
 <H4>New Button</H4>
 <P><IMG src="images/getpmschedule.gif" border=0 height=28 width=48 alt="images\getpmschedule.gif"> Clicking this button enables you to clone the PM Schedule from another Equipment record. When you click this button a list of equipment records who’s PM Schedules are eligible to be copied will appear. Equipment will only appear on this list if:</P>

 <P style="margin-left:29.50pt;">The record is active.</P>
 <P style="margin-left:29.50pt;">It includes one or more PM Inspection lines that haven't been generated into PM WOs.</P>
 <P style="margin-left:11.50pt;">When you select a record from the list and click ‘ok’, its PM Schedule entries (that have not yet had their PM Work Orders generated) will be copied to the current PM Schedule tab. Adjust these lines as needed before saving the record. This function now also <FONT style="text-decoration:underline;" >excludes</FONT> lines referencing a Master Contract. This enables you to set up and copy ‘extra’ PM’s that are not a part of a particular Master Contract. </P>

 <P style="margin-left:11.50pt;">The Master Contract Id field is now intended to be maintained from the contract information from the Master Contract viewer. Direct changes to this field are limited to the following:</P>
 <P style="margin-left:36.00pt;">1. Allow the Master Contract Id to be changed from blank to non-blank but don't allow it to be changed if it's already been set. The user will be advised that the Master Contract Id must be changed in the Master Contract record. </P>
 <P style="margin-left:36.00pt;">2. If the Master Contract Id gets changed from blank to non-blank, force the Under Contract? field to true.</P>
 <P style="margin-left:36.00pt;">3. Don't allow the Under Contract? field to be set to false when the Master Contract Id is not blank.</P>

 <P class="Tip_Note_Heading" style="margin-top:4.00pt;">Revised Fields:</P>
 <P><FONT style="font-weight:bold; " >Group Tax Rate:<BR></FONT>In most cases, the system will calculate this field for you based on the Authorities and rates entered on the Tax Authorities tab.  However, this field will be forced to zero if a graduated tax rate is specified in one or more of the Sales Tax Authorities listed on the Tax Authorities tab. </P>
 <P>This also corrects a problem where Sales Tax Group Rate was improperly cleared if a Sales Tax Authority with no rate was added (system gave the spurious message that a graduated tax authority was being added). </P>
 <P><FONT style="font-weight:bold; " >Cumulative?  Tax Labor?  Tax Material?  Tax Other?  Tax Subcontract? <BR></FONT>In this release, these sales tax rules may be set by the Tax Authority.</P>

 <P>If the Use Authority Rules box is blanked, the Tax Labor, Material, Other and Subcontract fields will all be blanked, and the taxation rules specified in the applicable Sales Tax Group records will be used instead. </P>
 <H3>4.4.2 New Tab: Rates</H3>
 <P class="Reference_Line" style="margin-bottom:0.00pt;">This tab enables you to specify a graduated sales tax rate by invoice amount.

 <H2>4.6 Client Site Templates Viewer</H2>
 <H3>Purpose:</H3>
 <P>This new viewer is designed for the creation and maintenance of the template records used in job cloning. Since this is a new viewer, it must be assigned to a user group or groups in order for it to be accessed. We strongly recommend that access be restricted to only those user groups that really need to be able to create or maintain template files. </P>
 <H3>Usage:</H3>
 <P>The Template option supports the New COD Site screen in for New Call 2.  Only those Sites that are flagged as templates will appear on the on Site COD screen. </P>
 <P>Work Orders cannot be created for template sites. </P>
 <H3>Important Fields:</H3>
 <P>Only those fields that are common to all Site records that be created from this template should be completed. Please refer to <A href="client_site_viewer.htm">Client Site Viewer</A>  for details on setting the other fields. </P>
 <P><FONT style="font-weight:bold; " >Template<BR></FONT>This field must be checked in order to flag this as a template record created for job cloning purposes. Site template records may only be created and modified in this viewer. </P>

 <H3>4.7.1 Client Collections Screen</H3>
 <P>In the client collections screen, unapplied cash receipts were no longer appearing in the central portion of the client collections screen. With this release, unapplied receipts once again appear in both the Payments Received (lower portion) and in the central portion. </P>
 <P>Client Collection New Note Display Problem corrected.</P>
 <H3>4.7.2 Client Collections Invoice Screen</H3>
 <P>This release<FONT style="font-weight:bold; " > </FONT>corrects a problem where a check scanned in the AR Cash Receipts was displayed instead of the invoice because it was the most recent document associated with that invoice. </P>
 <H2>4.8 Client Templates Viewer</H2>
 <H3>Purpose:</H3>
 <P>This new viewer is designed for the creation and maintenance of the template records used in job cloning. Since this is a new viewer, it must be assigned to a user group or groups in order for it to be accessed. We strongly recommend that access be restricted to only those user groups that really need to be able to create or maintain template files. </P>
 <H3>Usage:</H3>
 <H3>Important Fields:</H3>
 <P>Only those fields that are common to all Client records that be created from this template should be completed. Please refer to <A href="client_viewer.htm">Client Viewer</A> for details on setting the other fields. </P>
 <P><FONT style="font-weight:bold; " >Template<BR></FONT>This field must be checked in order to flag this as a template record created for job cloning purposes. Client template records may only be created and modified in this viewer. </P>
 <H2>4.9 Start Reverse Job Invoice</H2>
 <P>Corrects spurious error message ‘The job COD is not a template record.&nbsp; Please select a template Job from the list’ that displayed when you attempted to reverse a COD work order invoice. </P>
 <P>This function will no longer let you reverse an invoice if it has been receipted in AR Cash Receipts for a positive dollar amount.  This has been refined to allow a reversal if cash previously received has been zeroed out.</P>
 <P>Corrects problem where Invoice Id was not removed from manual entries on the Work Order Sales Tax tab. </P>
 <H2>4.10 Service Compute</H2>
 <P>Corrects a problem where service invoices were being saved in landscape instead of portrait if the report was auto-emailed or saved in PDF format.&nbsp; </P>
 <P><FONT style="font-weight:bold; " >Service Compute Invoicing of Extras on PM WO’s: </FONT>The system now allows extras manually entered and imported from PO’s to be billed on PM WO’s even if the Work Order’s PM Invoice Id is set. If the invoice id on the imported line matches the PM Invoice Id on the Work Order, these lines can be marked as extra and billed.  </P>
 <P>Now correctly follows Accounting Period rules for posting according to which boxes are checked. In previous releases, the default was to assume that posting was enabled for this function. </P>
 <P>The confirmation message that appears after printing service invoices has been expanded to the following: Did Report: SERVICE INVOICE print correctly and are invoices ready to be POSTED?</P>
 <H3>4.10.1 Email Service Invoice</H3>
 <P>This applies to SERVICEINVOICE.rpt and SERVICEWORKSHEET.rpt  dated 6/14/2007.</P>
 <P>The now uses the Job Contact 1 Email for the email invoices address. On the Billing Worksheet, if the email address is filled in AND the service invoice registry entry autoemail=true is set, then omit invoice address with be replaced with the Emailed To: address. </P>
 <H3>4.10.2 Sales Tax Base and Flat Rate Pricing</H3>
 <P>In recent releases, Service Compute evaluated the tax liability of individual lines bases on the cost category’s cost type and the taxable boxes in the sales tax group due to support for separate taxing rules for the individual authorities that become part of a Sales Tax Group.&nbsp; With the rules potentially defined at the Authority level, the tax calculations became more dependent on Cost Categories than the Tax Type specified on individual JCH entries.&nbsp; In effect, a Cost Category could be taxable for one authority but not for others within the same Sales Tax Group.</P>
 <P>This has been an issue with flat rate pricing, since the flat rate is typically divided in to taxable and non-taxable portions, but with only one cost category. The software has been changed to ignore job history entries where the Tax Type Id equals 'n/a' so that tax will not be assessed in this situation.</P>
 <H2>4.11 AR Cash Receipts</H2>
 <P>When a discount is accepted in A/R Receipt transaction, there is a discount amount for each invoice detail line. The software has been enhanced so that a G/L Entity for the discount posting to G/L will be established from the Job Cost Code referenced on each line.</P>
 <H2>4.12 AR Sales Journal Posting Report (RARSLSJRNLPSTNG.rpt)</H2>
 <P>Corrects problem where Credit memos were not being considered as a negative amount in the report. See your support rep if you require an updated report.  </P>
 <H2>4.13  Non-Service Compute Invoicing (RININV3 / RININV4) – CHANGE TO DEFAULT BEHAVIOR </H2>
 <P>This enhancement changes the default behavior for anyone who was entering labor or materials&nbsp;to a WORKORDER that was associated to a non-service compute job (RININV3 or RINVIN4).&nbsp;&nbsp;Users will no longer have to mark workorders 'Ready to Invoice' using Thumbs-up for the unbilled costs to appear in Record Billing Adjustments providing the Job's billing item is&nbsp;FIXED FEE &amp; RININV3 or RININV4. Note that NO changes were made to the way non-fixed fee Jobs work... users must continue to mark these 'ready to invoice' for them to appear in Record Billing Adjustment (e.g., Time&amp;Material Change Orders).&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</P>
 <P>A registry entry is available to return the system to its previous behavior. Please see section 2.16 of these user release notes for details. </P>
 <H2>4.14 Record Billing Adjustments</H2>
 <P><FONT style="font-weight:bold; " >Calculating Revenue with Margin, Markup and Multiplier</FONT></P>
 <P>In previous releases, if you used a Bill Type of Margin, Markup, or Multiplier the system didn’t react to the quantity billed being set to zero and still extended out the revenue based on the actual quantity. The code now forces the Extended Revenue to zero whenever the Bill Quantity is set to zero. The Extended Revenue may then be changed to a non-zero value if needed. This change effects revenue calculations in the AP Journal, Inventory Receipts Journal, Record Billing Adjustments, Job Journal, Labor Journal, Purchase Order, Quote and Worker Order viewers. </P>
 <H2>4.15  Service Billing Worksheet</H2>
 <P>Now supports negative value lines (meant to reduce revenue) when running the worksheet. </P>
 <H2>4.16 Standard Construction (AIA-style) Invoicing Enhancement</H2>
 <P>SAM Pro now provides users the means to generate standard construction forms (702 and 703) for Owners, Architects and Construction Managers. These forms may be printed in conjunction with the Certificate for Payment and Continuation Sheet bitmaps. See user note 2.43 for details.  </P>
 <H2>4.17 RINVINV3 – Canadian Format</H2>
 <P>The Canadian format includes a change to explicitly show the calculation of GST not including Retainage.  Available in RININV3.rpt dated 2/6/2006 and later. </P>

 <H2>5.1 GL Report Row Layout</H2>
 <P><FONT style="font-weight:bold; " >Misc:</FONT><BR>This field has been expanded from a 10-character field to a 100-character text box to allow for enhanced flexibility in GL reporting. </P>
 <H2>5.2  GL Account</H2>
 <P><FONT style="font-weight:bold; " >GL Account Type</FONT><BR>This is now a required field.</P>
 <H2>5.3 GL Reporting Tool</H2>
 <P>The GL Reporting Tool now allows users to save Report as CSV Delimited for import into Excel. This enhancement segments lines so that fields are distinct when saving as CSV so that files will reasonably formatted in Excel.</P>
 <P>This release also corrects problem with GL Type Reports when a report is defined with both the Font For Report Lines and Font For Heading Lines set as bold. If both these fields were set to bold, the user got an error lineSpacing Not Understood.&nbsp;Also note that if the Heading Font was not the default and the Line Font was the default, the number of lines per inch were being determined by the heading, not the line. </P>
 <H3>5.3.1 Define Total Rows</H3>
 <P>In previous releases, in a GL Report Row Layout definition, a DefineTot row defines a total account whose sign depends on whether the computed total is a net Debit or a net Credit. Net Debits generate a positive total and net Credits generate a negative total. This is regardless of the value of the Sign Control field on the DefineTot row. This results, for example, in a net Income total always generating a negative total. This can lead to percentages of net income showing up with an improper sign.</P>
 <P>This release implements the Sign Control field on the DefineTot row so that the report writer can define whether the computed total should be considered a normally Debit or a normally Credit account.</P>
 <H2>5.4 GL Report Viewer </H2>
 <P>Corrects error when running reports for which no UD function has been created. </P>
 <P>Corrects an error that occurred when a GL report was generated for a specific entity and that entity does not exist.</P>
 <H2>5.5 Bank Reconciliation Journal</H2>
 <P>GL Accounts for the Income and Expense are now retrieved an existing entry is selected for editing. </P>
 <P>The Delete and Delete Line buttons have been disabled in this journal. If you need to edit an entry, you may clear the CL box on a previously reconciled check, and the system will clear the Date Reconciled on the Check record, so that that check will again be eligible for reconciliation. </P>
 <P>If the Interest or Fee fields are filled in, a corresponding GL Account is required. </P>
 <P>If you do not enter interest or fees, the system no longer warns you about these account types.</P>
 <H1>6 Job Costing </H1>
 <H2>6.1 Job Journal</H2>
 <P>This build corrects the Job Journal Posting code that sporadically resulted in a ‘Key Is Missing’ message.</P>
 <P>The Transaction Type Range has been added to record filter screen. Values for range are Actual, Budget or Budget Change. </P>
 <P><FONT style="font-weight:bold; " >Calculating Revenue with Margin, Markup and Multiplier</FONT></P>
 <P>In previous releases, if you used a Bill Type of Margin, Markup, or Multiplier the system didn’t react to the quantity billed being zero and still extended out the revenue based on the actual quantity. The code now forces the Extended Revenue to zero whenever the Bill Quantity is set to zero. The Extended Revenue may then be changed to a non-zero value if needed. This change effects revenue calculations in the AP Journal, Inventory Receipts Journal, Record Billing Adjustments, Job Journal, Labor Journal, Purchase Order, Quote and Worker Order viewers. </P>

 <H2>6.2  Job Billing Item Status</H2>
 <H2>Purpose:</H2>
 <P>This record may be used to specify user-definable status codes for Job Billing Items. Typically, this would be used for Change Order type Billing Items for tracking purposes. For example, statuses could include New, Submitted, Review, Approved. </P>
 <H2>Usage:</H2>
 <P>Referenced in: Job Billing Item.</P>
 <P>This record has NO meaning in SAMPRO.&nbsp; It is strictly for use on reports designed by the users.</P>
 <H3>Important Fields:</H3>
 <P><FONT style="font-weight:bold; " >Status Id:<BR></FONT>Uniquely defines this Job Billing Status record. </P>
 <P><FONT style="font-weight:bold; " >Status Description: </FONT><BR>Briefly describes this status. </P>

 <P><FONT style="font-weight:bold; " >New Field: Status<BR></FONT>This optional field references the new Job Billing Item Status record. Although this new field has NO meaning in SAM Pro, it is designed for use on reports designed by the users, often in conjunction with tracking change order type billing items. </P>
 <H2>6.4 Job Viewer</H2>
 <P style="margin-top:0;margin-bottom:0"> In previous releases, when you accessed a Job, the system asked if you wanted the current client site and equipment filtered to that Job. This functionality has been turned off in response to popular demand. &nbsp;</P>
 <P>The system now allows jobs to be set to Service Compute unless status is Printed. If you do so, be sure to also modify the Invoice and Worksheet Id’s in the Job and Job Billing items as needed. </P>
 <H3>6.4.1 Main Tab</H3>
 <P><FONT style="font-weight:bold; " >New Field: Template<BR></FONT>If this field is checked, it indicates that it is a template record that was created for job cloning purposes. Clicking the Clone Job button will create launch the Clone Job Wizard that will let you create a real job record based on this template information. This field may not be cleared in the Job viewer:  the new Job Templates viewer must be used to edit Template fields; this new feature is discussed in section 6.5 of these release notes. </P>
 <P style="margin-left:36.00pt;"><FONT style="font-weight:bold; " >NOTE: Turning a Job into a Template</FONT><BR>In certain cases, a Job may be turned into a template by a user with assess to the Job Template Viewer. However, Jobs that have Recorded Costs or Billings may not be turned into a Template.  Several fields, including the Date Opened, Date Closed and PO Number will be cleared in this case.  The system also displays a warning when a job is set to a job template and client or sites are not template records.</P>
 <P><FONT style="font-weight:bold; " >Changed Button: Clone Job<BR></FONT>The system will now warn you if you launch the wizard for a Job that is not flagged as a template. </P>
 <P style="margin-left:36.00pt;"><FONT style="font-weight:bold; " >Change to Default Behavior:</FONT>  In previous releases, a user was allowed to add jobs via the Job viewer’s Clone Job button even if Add Record was not checked for the Job record in the user’s User Groups and Functions record. Users belonging to User Groups that are allowed to access but not add Jobs will be warned that they do not have rights to add job records if they click the Clone Job button. </P>
 <P><FONT style="font-weight:bold; " >Changed Field: Material Price Level:<BR></FONT>The field now overrides the material price level in the Site record and enables the following functionality:</P>
 <P>1.  When a Work Order is created, the Price level defaults from the Job (if set); if not, it will default from the Client Site record.  This functionality has been added to work orders created in New Call (it has always worked in work orders created via Create PM Work Orders).  Note that the Price Code, if present, always comes from the Site. <BR><BR>2. If you specify a Job on a PO line, the price level previously defaulted to 1 when the revenue was calculated, regardless of what the job or client site specified.&nbsp; This has corrected so that the field Material Price level in the Job record overrides the material price level in the Site record when revenue is calculated.</P>
 <H3><FONT style="font-weight:normal; " >6.</FONT>4.2 Job Clone Wizard</H3>
 <P>When the Job Clone Wizard is launched for a Template Job, the Job, Client Site, and Client fields will all be cleared.  </P>
 <P>If Job Id auto-numbering is implemented on your system, leave the Job Id field blank and the system will generate it for you. </P>
 <P>Corrects problem with doubling/deleting of Commission, Milestone lines.</P>
 <P>Corrects problem that happened when tabbing through the fields; the boxes shifted up when entering Site Name or Client Name.</P>
 <P>The Client Site Equipment’s Master Contract Id is no longer copied to cloned equipment records. </P>
 <H3>6.4.2 Job Commissions Tab</H3>
 <P><FONT style="font-weight:bold; " >New Fields: Start Date  End Date</FONT></P>
 <P>These new fields may be used define the date ranges that the share / commission is valid.</P>
 <P>The introduction of these new fields has made the test that requires the sum of the individual Share% values to equal 100% obsolete. This validation is no longer required.</P>
 <H3>6.4.3 Job Purchases Tab</H3>
 <P>Purchases Orders with a status of Unreleased, PendingCancel and Cancelled have been eliminated from the list of PO’s.&nbsp;</P>
 <H2>6.5 Job Templates Viewer</H2>
 <H3>Purpose:</H3>
 <P>This new viewer is designed for the creation and maintenance of the template records used in job cloning. Since this is a new viewer, it must be assigned to a user group or groups in order for it to be accessed. We strongly recommend that access be restricted to only those user groups that really need to be able to create or maintain template files. </P>
 <H3>Usage:</H3>
 <P>A Job Template record may be selected in the Job Viewer prior to launching the Clone Job wizard.  A real Job record will be created based on the information contained in the template record.</P>
 <H3>Important Fields:</H3>
 <P>Only those fields that are common to all Job records that be created from this template should be completed. Please refer to the <A href="job_viewer.htm">Job Viewer</A>  for details on setting the other fields. </P>
 <P><FONT style="font-weight:bold; " >Template<BR></FONT>This field must be checked in order to flag this as a template record created for job cloning purposes. Job template records may only be created and modified in this viewer. </P>
 <P><FONT style="font-weight:bold; " >Client Site Id</FONT>:<BR>If you are using New Call 2 - COD processing with this Job, the Client Site should be blank. If this field is completed (for regular template jobs), the system will validate that the Client Site Id points to a Client Site Template.</P>
 <H2>6.6  Job Cost Code Viewer</H2>
 <P>Job Cost Codes attached to Job Template records may only be edited by users with access to Job Templates via their User Groups. </P>
 <H2>6.7 Job Progress Viewer</H2>
 <P>This addresses a situation where the user needs to mark a line as being 100% complete even though the line has zero actual costs.&nbsp; The code has been modified so that when the Projected Cost equals zero, the Percent Complete is set to: (a) 100 when the Budgeted Cost IS NOT zero, or (b) Zero (like the original code) when the Budgeted Cost IS zero.&nbsp;</P>
 <H2>6.8 Start Job End of Month Processing</H2>
 <P>This release corrects a problem with unreliable results when the Job EOM process was run multiple times in a single accounting period. </P>
 <P>This release also addresses the following specific set of circumstances:</P>
 <P style="margin-left:36.00pt;">1. Run Job Cost EOM for a T&amp;M work order that hasn't been billed.<BR>2. Invoice the work order in the same period as the Job Cost EOM processed.<BR>3. Re-run the Job Cost EOM so it can undo the entries made in #1 above.</P>
 <P style="margin-left:36.00pt;">Prior to this fix there was a problem in step #3: the software thought there wasn't any work to do and so it would not undo the step #1 entries. Step #3 now works properly to undo the entries made in step #1(they will appear in the checklist with a negative value).</P>
 <P>The Job Cost EOM has also been enhanced to recognize the there might be a GL Income Account in the Cost Category and includes it in the computations. </P>
 <P>Prior to this release, the billing item's Fixed Fee flag was the only consideration.&nbsp; The new code also checks the job's Service Compute flag.&nbsp; All billing items attached to service compute jobs are now treated as T&amp;M, regardless of the Fixed Fee flag setting.</P>
 <P>Validation has been added to this function that will prevent Jobs with missing GL information from being posted. If you attempt to select or click the Go button if this situation exists, the system will display the error “Job (Job Id) has detail lines that are missing GL Accounts” and will not allow the post to proceed with the illegible lines flagged. </P>
 <P>&nbsp;<FONT style="font-weight:bold; " >Hint:</FONT> The sys-job-eom registry entry or the cost category should be examined if this message is displayed. </P>
 <H2>6.9 Project Manager Viewer</H2>
 <P>In previous releases, the Project Manager viewer currently placed jobs into the Open or Closed tabs by whether the Date Closed was set or not. This has been made more sensitive so that jobs with the Closed Dates set to today or later appear in the Open tab (since they are open as of today). Jobs with a Closed Date of yesterday or earlier will appear in the Closed tab.</P>
 <H2>6.10 Start Job Cost Allocation </H2>
 <P>A new range, Tax Group Id, has been added to Start Job Cost Allocation function. When completed, this range limits the range of eligible jobs to those where the Tax Group Id (in the Job record) matches the Tax Group Id(s) specified in the Tax Group range. </P>
 <P style="margin-top:0;margin-bottom:0">&nbsp;</P>
 <H1>7 Inventory</H1>
 <H2>7.1 Location Viewer</H2>
 <P>When an inventory item is ‘cloned’ (using an existing record to create a new one), the Last Cost is now cleared when the new record is created. Note that if the Standard Cost is set in the new record, the last cost field will default from it (this is the desired behavior). </P>
 <P><FONT style="font-weight:bold; " >New Field:</FONT></P>
 <P><FONT style="font-weight:bold; " >Include on Record Advice Report<BR>Include on Report?<BR></FONT>The PO Reorder Advice Report will now exclude locations not specified for Reorder Advice reporting. This field will<FONT style="font-weight:bold; " > </FONT>default to checked (true) during data conversion. To exclude a location from reorder advice reporting, simply clear this field. If you employ Truck Restocking functionality, truck locations should <FONT style="text-decoration:underline;" >not </FONT>be included on the Reorder Advice report. </P>
 <P style="margin-top:0;margin-bottom:0">&nbsp;</P>
 <H2>7.2 Inventory Receipts Journal</H2>
 <P>The test for allowing edits for lines already imported into WO and then deleted has been made smarter. </P>
 <P>Enhanced validation has been added to this journal that prevents vouchered items from being ‘unreceived’.  The system will not let you change the received quantity of a vouchered item. </P>
 <P>Lot Controlled Items that are not Quality Controlled are now assigned the Status of Accepted when they are received in the PO/Inventory Receipts journal. If they were bought to stock, they will appear as On Hand in their receiving Location. Items bought to Job are also assigned the status of accepted.</P>
 <P>This release corrects an auto-loading problem caused by defaulting the receiving Location from the Work Order.&nbsp; This has been changed to preserve the Location from the PO record. In addition, clicking Refresh before saving a transaction now clears all fields in the parent record.</P>
 <P>The system no longer forces you to complete the location field for serialized items that you did not receive. </P>
 <P>Corrects problems with IM history that occurred if inventory associated with a job was received to a location other than the PO default location. </P>
 <P>This release also corrects a spurious  &quot;PO has been changed since the Transaction was started&quot; message. This message occurred if the user initially entered the base PO number when the Purchase Order had since evolved into a change order.</P>
 <P><FONT style="font-weight:bold; " >Completed:<BR></FONT>The Completed flag may no longer be set for PO lines associated with Jobs or Work Orders. </P>
 <P><FONT style="font-weight:bold; " >Changed Field – Date Received:</FONT><BR>The system now validates the entry date against eligible dates in the accounting period selected.&nbsp; This will prevent users from selecting dates that are in closed accounting periods.</P>
 <H2>7.3 Inventory Item Record</H2>
 <P>Last Cost computations now also factor in the Date field in converted data.</P>
 <P>The system now makes use of Floating Point arithmetic when computing average cost. This results in a performance enhancement when accessing inventory item records – particularly those with a lot of history.  </P>
 <P><FONT style="font-weight:bold; " >Lot Controlled Items </FONT></P>
 <P style="margin-left:36.00pt;"><FONT style="font-weight:bold; " >Inventory Receipts Journal viewer</FONT></P>
 <P style="margin-left:36.00pt;">Items that are not Quality Controlled are now assigned the Status of Accepted when they are received in the PO/Inventory Receipts journal. If they were bought to stock, they will appear as On Hand in their receiving Location. Items bought to Job are also assigned the status of accepted.</P>
 <P style="margin-left:36.00pt;"><FONT style="font-weight:bold; " >Work Order Inventory Tab</FONT></P>
 <P style="margin-left:36.00pt;">When adding lot-controlled items to the Work Order Inventory tab, the Vendor’s Serial/Lot Number is now displayed on the detail view (accessed by clicking the Magnify button on the WO Inventory tab). Note that when you click on the Serial/Lot field to select from a list of Lot numbers, the InventoryItemSerializedbyIdbyItem sort order displays the Vendor’s Lot number. </P>
 <P><FONT style="font-weight:bold; " >Show Computation Button<BR></FONT>Performance enhancement on display of computations.</P>
 <H3>7.3.0 Inventory Item Unit Cost computation – Change to Default Behavior</H3>
 <P>This release enhances the computation of the Inventory Items Unit Cost for items tagged as using the Average Cost methodology. It corrects inconsistencies that occurred when the quantity on hand at locations went negative, and will result in a more accurate calculation of average cost. The Inventory Item Record, Purchase Order, Client Order, Work Order Inventory Tab, Shop Order, Inventory Receipt Journal, Inventory Adjustments Journal, Inventory Journal, and the Job Journal are impacted by this change. In Quotemaster, the enhanced average cost calculations are used, but not the following costing hierarchy. </P>
 <P><FONT style="font-weight:bold; " >Inventory Costing Hierarchy</FONT></P>
 <P>The following costing hierarchy is now employed to determine the unit cost of inventory items. If the preferred computation (#1) is not available (for example, the item does not exist at the specified location), the system will try the second, then the third, and so on.  The unit cost computation will depend on whether the Inventory Item is flagged as used Average, Last or Standard. <FONT style="font-weight:bold; " >Since the Standard Cost is used if the system cannot locate a more recent / precise cost, it is very important for this field to be completed in the Inventory Item record. </FONT></P>
 <P>Note: ‘constrained by Where’ indicates that the Inventory History query may be conditioned by inventory location, serial number, and/or effective date.</P>
 <P style="margin-left:36.00pt;"><FONT style="font-weight:bold; " >Inventory Items Flagged as </FONT><FONT style="font-weight:bold; " >Average Cost:</FONT></P>

 <H3>7.3.1 Inventory Item Location Tab</H3>
 <P>This tab is sorted by Location Id when the Inventory Item record is saved or opened.</P>
 <H3>7.3.2 Inventory Purchases Tab</H3>
 <P>Corrects problem where the Cost on this tab was not updated correctly if the PO cost was changed. </P>
 <P>Display problem in Vendor Name, Id fields corrected.</P>
 <P>This release enhances the functionality of this tab.  If an item was received to a location other than the PO default, the Job On Hand will still display as 0 – however, if you double click on the line, the Purchasing and Inventory Receipts detail will be displayed. Note that you must click another tab and then the purchases tab again to return from the PO Detail view.  </P>
 <H3>7.3.3 Inventory Item Serialized tab </H3>
 <P>The release corrects sporadic display issue when PO number but no Vendor appeared. Also sets PO Id for Inventory Adjustments in Serialized display.</P>
 <H3>7.3.4 Inventory Item BOM tab</H3>
 <P>A new button, BOM CSV, has been added to the side button bar of the Inventory Item BOM tab. When clicked, this button dumps the BOM to a CSV formated file that can then be imported into Excel. This feature uses the CSV settings (for file formatting and saving) specified in the sys-csv registry setting. The user may launch Excel with the newly created CVS file loaded directly from SAM Pro. </P>
 <P>The CSV file contains the following columns: Master Id, Description, Quantity, UM, Component Id, Description, Unit Cost, Total Cost. </P>
 <H2>7.4 Inventory Restock</H2>
 <P>The methodology has been changed in this function. Effective now...the &quot;trigger&quot; mechanism is that when &quot;on hand&quot; quantity is less than the &quot;reorder level&quot;, an item will qualify for replenishment, and the Quantity to PICK will be however many are required to bring the &quot;on hand&quot; quantity up to the &quot;Order Up To Level.</P>
 <P style="margin-left:36.00pt;">for instance...if 2 are on hand<BR>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; 3 is the reorder level<BR>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; 10 is the order up to<BR><BR>then an item would qualify for 8 to be picked.</P>
 <H2>7.5 View Inventory Stock Status</H2>
 <P>Fixes to primary and other quantity calculations.</P>
 <H2>7.6 Inventory Adjustments Journal</H2>
 <P>This release implements Use Tax calculations for job-related activity entered in this Journal. Use tax will now be included in material cost, material wip, and total job cost in JCH. The computed use tax will also be posted as additional expense and liability into the GLH.</P>
 <P><FONT style="font-weight:bold; " >Serialized Items</FONT><FONT style="font-weight:bold; " >: </FONT><FONT style="font-weight:bold; " ><BR></FONT>The system now checks if the serialized item is actually on-hand at the From location when moving from a location to a Job or Location. It does not test for its presence in the To Job or the From Job. In addition, validation has been added to prevent the use from the user from transferring more than 1 of a serial number from a job into a location. The system does not allow the adjustment if the serialized item is already on hand at a location. </P>
 <H2>7.7 Return Authorizations</H2>
 <P>If a Client Order is referenced in a Return, the system now validates that the current Return Quantity does not exceed the original Quantity Sold less any previous Returns for the same order.</P>
 <P>Corrects spurious error message &quot;quantity returned exceeds quantity sold minus previous quantity returned&quot; if the number of items you received was less than the number authorized in the RA.</P>
 <H2>7.8 Inventory Physical Count</H2>
 <P>Corrects a problem in the report where the Total On Hand field was erroneously including inventory purchased to jobs if Include Missing Items was flagged. </P>
 <P style="margin-top:0;margin-bottom:0">&nbsp;</P>
 <H2>7.9  Start Rebuild Inventory Cost Table</H2>
 <P>This new starter function creates and fills a new table 'Item_Costs_By_Lctn' (dropping a pre-existing table if one exists). When this function is run, it will create a snapshot of inventory costs at each location at that moment in time that may be used for reporting purposes. Note that although the table will exist in your database, a View is not available in SAM Pro.</P>
 <P>If your firm has a significant amount of inventory history, you may wish to run this function after hours.  Reports that access this table should be run as soon as possible after the function is run. This table will contain the following columns evaluated for each combination of item and location in the invntryitmlctn table:</P>
 <P>&nbsp; &nbsp; invntryitm_rn<BR>&nbsp; &nbsp; lctn_rn<BR>&nbsp; &nbsp; qntty_on_hnd<BR>&nbsp; &nbsp; avrge_cst<BR>&nbsp; &nbsp; lst_cst</P>

 <H2>8.4 Executive Payroll Overview</H2>
 <P>This enhancement enables you to limit access to sensitive executive salary information to a specific user or users.  A new field labeled 'Executive P/R?' has been added to both the User and Employee records.&nbsp; By definition:</P>
 <P style="margin-left:23.75pt;">An Executive P/R User has full access to ALL employees.</P>
 <P style="margin-left:23.75pt;">An Executive P/R Employee is only accessible by an Executive P/R User.</P>
 <P style="margin-left:59.75pt;">The Executive Payroll check box in an Employee record may only be set or cleared by a user with the Executive Payroll box checked in their user record</P>
 <P class="Reference_Line" style="margin-bottom:0.00pt;">Executive Payroll enter/edit restrictions are also applied to the following viewers so that users without the Executive Payroll flag will not be able to access entries for Executive Payroll Employees: </P>
 <P class="Reference_Line" style="margin-left:23.75pt;margin-bottom:0.00pt;">Labor Journal</P>
 <P class="Reference_Line" style="margin-left:23.75pt;margin-bottom:0.00pt;">PR Journal</P>
 <P class="Reference_Line" style="margin-left:23.75pt;margin-bottom:0.00pt;">Job Journal</P>
 <P class="Reference_Line" style="margin-bottom:0.00pt;">In addition, access restrictions will also apply to these functions: users that are not flagged as Executive Payroll will only be able to run these functions for Employees that are also not flagged as Executive Payroll:</P>
 <P class="Reference_Line" style="margin-bottom:0.00pt;text-indent:18.00pt;">Compute Payroll</P>

 <P class="Reference_Line" style="margin-bottom:0.00pt;">Tip: in addition to the user who will be normally be running compute payroll and generating checks for your Executive Payroll employee, you may wish to designate another user with this permission. In this way, your firm is covered if the person who normally runs these functions is ill or on vacation. </P>
 <H3>Job History Postings</H3>
 <P><FONT style="font-weight:bold; " >Labor Journal, WO Labor, and Job Journal:</FONT> Beginning with this release, if an employee is marked as (Y) Executive Payroll, the Job History Reference ID and Reference Description will be blank for new lines posted from these viewers.&nbsp; </P>
 <P><FONT style="font-weight:bold; " >Compute Payroll/PR Checks:</FONT> Earnings marked as Job Cost P/R Check now posts to Job History with the Reference ID and Reference Description blank if the Employee is flagged for Executive Payroll. </P>
 <H3>Executive Payroll Filtering</H3>
 <P>Where appropriate, 'Executive P/R:' has been added to the filters/ranges for viewers and reports.&nbsp; This field defaults to 'N' or 'Y' according to the value in the User's account.&nbsp; This is done for the convenience of the Executive P/R User so that initial lists and reports show only Executive P/R employees.&nbsp; The Executive P/R User can change the default on an as-needed basis.</P>
 <P style="margin-left:36.00pt;"><FONT style="font-weight:bold; " >Executive Payroll List Views:</FONT>  In previous releases of 7.0, users that have the Executive Payroll option selected in the user record only saw employees marked as Executive PR because the filter is preset to Executive PR=Y. This has been changed so that they can see all employees on the list by default. This impacts the Employee, Labor Journal, and Payroll Journal list views. </P>
 <P>Users not marked for Executive P/R also have access to the Executive P/R range field.&nbsp; However, under no circumstances will they be allowed to view Executive P/R Employees, regardless of how they attempt to use the field. </P>
 <H3>Payroll Reports</H3>
 <P>Many of Data-Basics payroll related user-defined reports have been revised in order to accommodate this enhancement. Be sure to obtain these reports from your support representative and install them in your database.  </P>

 <H3>8.5.10 New Tab: Recurring Wages</H3>
 <P>This tab is used in conjunction with the new Start Generate Recurring Labor Entries function (described in section 8.9 of these release notes) to generate labor journal entries for workers that typically record a standard number of hours to a particular job or jobs. These journal entries may then be edited if needed. Managerial, IT or administrative workers whose hours are always applied to overhead jobs would be good candidates for this tab. </P>
 <P>When setting up this tab, carefully thought should be given to how your Payroll Periods are structured.  The days specified on this tab should map to the time period covered by the payroll period.  For example, this tab would not be suitable for use with monthly pay periods that began on the first day of the month – regardless of what day of the week it was.  It would be suitable for weekly or bi-weekly pay periods that always began on the same day of the week. </P>
 <H3>Important Fields:</H3>
 <P><FONT style="font-weight:bold; " >Start Date:</FONT> (date format mmddyyyy) &nbsp;<FONT style="font-weight:bold; " >End Date:</FONT> (date format mmddyyyy) <BR>Enter starting and ending <FONT style="font-weight:bold; " >working</FONT> dates to define the time period that this recurring entry is valid for. These fields are compared with the date range of the selected payroll period when the Generate Recurring Labor Entries function is run. </P>
 <P> <FONT style="font-weight:bold; " >Cycle:<BR></FONT>This field defines the cycle for which this recurring entry would be generated.  For example, M (monthly), Q (quarterly), W (weekly), P (payroll period) and so on. The Generate Recurring Labor Entries function checks this field against the Cycle Code that you entered on the Recurring Wages tab of the Employee Record.  It is recommended that a Cycle Code always be specified when running this function.</P>
 <P><FONT style="font-weight:bold; " >Day in Period:</FONT><BR>This field controls which day in the payroll period the generated labor journal entry will be assigned to.  </P>

 <P class="Reference_Line" style="margin-left:36.00pt;margin-bottom:0.00pt;">Alternately, if your payroll periods are bi-weekly and being on Monday, you would create recurring lines for days 1-5 and 8-12. </P>

 <H2>8.6  Workers Comp Category</H2>
 <H3>8.6.1  Support for Employee Portion of Worker’s Comp Expense</H3>
 <P>In some states (e.g., Washington), a portion of the worker’s compensation expense (the employee rate) is the responsibility of the employee.  When an employee rate is designated, that portion of the total workers comp liability should be withheld from the employee as if it were a deduction. In previous releases, a miscellaneous deduction  (per employee or deduction group) was used to handle this situation. However, since it was a single deduction (covering all workers comp categories to which an employee might be assigned), the employee rate variability among the different workers comp categories was not fully addressed.  </P>
 <P style="margin-left:36.00pt;"><FONT style="font-weight:bold; " >Note:</FONT> If you already have a deduction implemented for Worker’s Comp, you may wish to convert to this enhanced functionality.  If so, be sure to discuss this with your support rep. Depending upon how your system is configured, you will need to change the end date of the current worker’s comp deduction on the Employee Deductions tab, or remove the WC Deduction from the Deduction Group.  In addition, the Deduction and Employee Rate fields must be completed for all applicable Workers Comp Categories. <FONT style="font-weight:bold; " >&nbsp;</FONT></P>
 <P class="Reference_Line" style="margin-bottom:0.00pt;">This release supports the ability to specify the employee contribution portion (if any) on the worker’s compensation record itself. Since this portion frequently varies by the worker’s compensation category, this new functionality accurately assesses the employee’s portion to the employee. </P>
 <P><FONT style="font-weight:bold; " >Changed Field:</FONT></P>
 <P><FONT style="font-weight:bold; " >Total Rate:<BR></FONT>In previous versions, this field was simply labeled as Rate. In this version, it has been changed to Total Rate to emphasize that is the total of the employer and employee worker’s comp rates. The difference of the Total Rate less the Employee Rate will be the resulting &quot;expense&quot; to be posted to the expense account for W.C.</P>
 <P><FONT style="font-weight:bold; " >New Fields:</FONT></P>
 <P><FONT style="font-weight:bold; " >Deduction Id:<BR></FONT>This field should be used to reference a Deduction record created for use with the employee portion of the worker’s comp. The deduction should be of Type Miscellaneous, with an appropriate Check Label filled in (e.g., WC), the Amount field blank; typically, the Amount Type is set to hourly.  Although the GL Account needs to be completed in the Deduction record, the system will actually credit the GL Debit Account from the Worker’s Comp State record to record the employee’s contributions as an offset to the WC expense. </P>
 <P style="margin-left:36.00pt;"><FONT style="font-weight:bold; " >Important: </FONT>It is not necessary or desirable to specify this Deduction Id in either the Employee Record Deductions Tab or the Deductions Group record. The software will manage the deduction correctly with it specified in the applicable Workers Comp Category records. </P>
 <P><FONT style="font-weight:bold; " >Employee Rate:<BR></FONT>Enter the rate for the employee’s portion of the Worker Comp rate. For example, if this is an hour rate, this rate times the hours worked will appear as a miscellaneous deduction on the employee’s paycheck. </P>

 <P><FONT style="font-weight:bold; " >Calculating Revenue with Margin, Markup and Multiplier</FONT></P>
 <P>In previous releases, if you used a Bill Type of Margin, Markup, or Multiplier the system didn’t react to the quantity billed being set to zero and still extended out the revenue based on the actual quantity. The code now forces the Extended Revenue to zero whenever the Bill Quantity is set to zero. The Extended Revenue may then be changed to a non-zero value if needed. </P>
 <P><FONT style="font-weight:bold; " >Payroll Period: </FONT>The user is now prevented from selecting an active Payroll Period with a closed Accounting Period.

 <P>In previous releases, this field was NOT being set if source of data entry is the labor journal. This leads to the possibility that there will in fact be unbilled costs and forces the user to generate a Zero $$ billing...exactly what the PM Invoice feature was designed to prevent. This enhancement extends this functionality to the Labor Journal.&nbsp;Essentially if the PM Invoice reference is populated in a Work Order Id, then all lines entered (excluding those marked extra or having revenue) are recorded as being associated to the PM Invoice that has been previously computed/posted.&nbsp; </P>

 <H2>8.9 Start Generate Recurring Labor Entries</H2>
 <H3>Purpose: </H3>
 <P>This function may be used to generate labor journal entries for workers that typically record a standard number of hours to a particular job or jobs. These journal entries may then be edited if needed. </P>
 <P>Managerial, IT or administrative workers whose hours are always applied to overhead jobs would be good candidates for this function. </P>
 <H3>Usage:</H3>
 <P>This function uses the Recurring Wages tab of the Employee record to determine the hours that should be applied to the selected payroll period. The days specified on the Recurring Wages tab (see section 8.5.10 of these release notes) should map to the time period covered by the payroll period. </P>

 <H2>8.13 Report PR W2 </H2>
 <P><FONT style="font-weight:bold; " >New Fields: Start Date   End Date<BR></FONT>The system will now set the Start Date(01/01) and the End Date(12/31) whenever the Year field gets changed. These dates may not be edited by the used unless a registry entry (discussed in section 2.13 of these release notes) is implemented. These fields would be edited to enable partial year reporting for your W2’s. This would be desirable if, for example, your company’s EIN changed mid-year.</P>
 <P><FONT style="font-weight:bold; " >2007 W-2 Format Changes:</FONT> In the actual W-2, the Social Security Number has been moved to the government mandated position so that it will not show through an envelope window. The Control number has also been relocated.  Note that the Plain Paper copy does not reflect these changes. </P>
 <H3>8.13.1 Added support for 4-up forms</H3>
 <P><FONT style="font-weight:bold; " >Copy A:</FONT> this copy must still be printed in the 2-up format. </P>
 <P><FONT style="font-weight:bold; " >New Print Options:</FONT></P>
 <P><FONT style="font-weight:bold; " >BC2</FONT><BR>This option prints 1 copy B, 1 copy C, and 2 copies of 2 on one page in the 4-up Horizontal format. One employee will be listed on each page. Note that since only 2 copy 2’s are printed, additional copies of this report will need to be printed if more than one state plus one local authority (or 2 local authorities or 2 states) would be printed for a single employee’s W-2.  </P>
 <P style="margin-left:36.00pt;"><FONT style="font-weight:bold; " >Limitations of the BC2 4-Up Functionality</FONT><FONT style="font-weight:bold; " ><BR></FONT>This functionality was originally designed for those cases where no more than one state plus one local authority (or 2 local authorities or 2 states) would ever be printed for a single employee’s W2.  For example, employees that work in states that have ONLY state taxing authorities would be good candidates for this functionality. If more then 2 copy 2’s are needed for an employee, more than one copy of the BC2 report must be printed, with the Tax Authority range set appropriately.  </P>
 <P style="margin-left:36.00pt;"><FONT style="font-weight:bold; " >Important: </FONT><FONT style="font-weight:bold; " >Always Set Tax Authority<BR></FONT>When printing with the BC2 option, ALWAYS complete the Tax Authority Range. Failure to do so will result in too many copies of the form being printing.</P>
 <P><FONT style="font-weight:bold; " >1x4</FONT><BR>This option prints 4 copies of 1 (for the state or local taxing authority) on one page in the 4-up Horizontal format. Four employees will be listed on each page, sorted by tax authority, then employee. One W2 form will be printed for each employee/taxing authority combination where the employee earned wages.  This report will be ordered by the Tax Authority Id first, and the Sort Employees By option within each Taxing Authority.  A summary page will be produced for each taxing authority.  In order to produce separate runs for state and local authorities, you may wish to produce one print run with the Type range completed as state, and another with the Type specified as local.</P>
 <P><FONT style="font-weight:bold; " >Dx4<BR></FONT>This option prints 4 copies of D (for the employer) on one page in the 4-up Horizontal format. Four employees  will be listed per page, sorted by SSN or Last Name. One W2 form will be printed for each employee with Federal/FICA wages plus a summary page at the end of the run.  Note: in general, you would leave the Tax Authority Id, Type and State fields blank for this run.  The Employee Id range enables you to reprint W2's for one or more employees or to print an alignment copy. </P>
 <H3>8.13.2 Added support for W3’s</H3>
 <P>See section 2.18 of these release notes for the registry entry required for this functionality. </P>
 <P>The Copy A option of Report W2 has been expanded to allow the printing of a W3 form at the end of the report.  The system will print the Copy A’s and summary page as usual, and then pause. The following message box will appear:</P>
 <P>&nbsp;Print W3 Form?  Insert W3 Form Now.</P>
 <P>If you want to print the W3, DO <FONT style="font-weight:bold; " >NOT</FONT> RESPOND TO THIS MESSAGE IMMEDIATELY. To print the W3 form, the user should verify that all Copy A’s plus the summary page have been printed, and then load the W3 form in the printer.</P>
 <P><FONT style="font-weight:bold; " >After</FONT> the W3 form has been loaded, the user should then click Yes in the message box to print the W3 form. Note that if taxes for more than one state have been assessed, an X will be printed in the State portion of Box 15, and the Employer’s state ID number will be blank. </P>

 <H2>8.14 Magnetic Media State Unemployment Reporting</H2>
 <H3>Purpose:</H3>
 <P>A new report, RSTTEUE.rpt is now available to satisfy state unemployment electronic reporting.  Reporting for the states of Kansas and Texas is currently supported.</P>
 <H3>Usage:</H3>
 <P>The Employer Id field (in all applicable SUTA Tax Authority records) must be set to your State EIN.</P>
 <H3>Registry Entries:</H3>
 <P>The following registry entries must be completed before running this report: sys-report-rstteue and sys-ue-ef; see sections 2.27 and 2.28. </P>
 <H3>Usage:</H3>
 <P>1.Verify that an up-to-date version of RSTTEUE.rpt has been installed in your database. </P>
 <P>2. This report must be run for the specified year,state and quarter. Unless you are only running this for a specific employee, the Employee range should remain blank.</P>
 <P>2. When the report appears in the report viewer, Click Save to Disk.</P>
 <P>3. A Windows save file box will appear: You must select Save As Text File, and provide a name as per your state’s specifications (do not specify an extension, this will be done for you). Remember where you saved the file!</P>
 <P>4. Upload your file as specified by the state. </P>
 <H2>8.15 Compute Payroll</H2>
 <P>This release corrects a sporadic problem in allocating the job cost amount of fringes (marked as Job Cost PR Checks) for labor journal entries that included a pay rate factor greater than one.  </P>
 <P>The computations that reduce taxable pay for a given tables Standard Deduction Percentage were calculating standard deduction to be too low. This problem has been corrected.</P>
 <P>This release corrects a problem where an employee had WC withheld for a pay period that nothing but Vacation Pay.&nbsp; Vacation Pay is not subject to employer WC so it should also be exempt from employee WC.</P>
 <P>A warning message has been added to the employee's error list during Compute PR if the tax computed for any Payroll Authority is negative. These error messages are printed on the Report PR Worksheet. </P>
 <P>Corrects intermediate calculation problems encountered when processing very large bonuses checks.  </P>
 <P>Corrects problem that occurred when excessive changes were made to Labor Journal entry used in compute payroll.&nbsp; Cost Category was one of the data elements changed between the first and last iterations of the trx.&nbsp; The compute was always using the GL Expense account from the initial Cost Category; this has been corrected.</P>
 <H2>8.16 Earnings Group Viewer – lower section</H2>
 <P>In previous releases, the user was not prevented from entering lines where, for the same earnings id, the dates overlap. The system now validates that no overlap occurs for overlapping dates on combinations of Earnings Codes and Pay Types.</P>
 <P><FONT style="font-weight:bold; " >Add to Wages for Wage-Based Fringes?</FONT> (eligible for lines that are both &quot;fringe&quot; &amp; &quot;hourly&quot;)</P>
 <P><FONT style="font-weight:bold; " >Subject to Fringe Additions</FONT><FONT style="font-weight:bold; " >?</FONT> (eligible for lines that are (&quot;fringe&quot; or &quot;n/a&quot;) &amp; &quot;hourly&quot;)</P>
 <P>These fields provide the ability to include certain fringes (deferred compensation) in the basis &quot;wages&quot; for percentage calculations of other fringe benefits. This functionality was required to satisfy payroll for a specific union contract, where the 401a  (a union equivalent of 401k) must be separated from the base wage for some calculations but not for others.</P>
 <P style="margin-left:36.00pt;"><FONT style="text-decoration:underline;" >Example:</FONT><FONT style="text-decoration:underline;" >Include 401(a) fringe in calculation of H&amp;W fringe</FONT><FONT style="text-decoration:underline;" ><BR></FONT>Example:<BR>Wage&nbsp; $38<BR>401(a) $2<BR>H&amp;W 5% (needs to evaluate as 5% of $40=$2)<BR><BR>In this example...<BR>401(a) is an hourly-based fringe marked True for &quot;Include in Wage Basis?&quot;.<BR>H&amp;W is a percent-based fringe marked True for &quot;Subject to Fringe Additions?&quot;.<BR><BR>Prior to this mod, the H&amp;W fringe for each hour worked would have been computed as $38 x .05.&nbsp; By setting the new options as indicated in the example, the computation becomes ($38 + $2) x .05.</P>
 <H2>8.17 Deduction Groups Viewer</H2>
 <P>In previous releases, the user was not prevented from entering lines where, for the same deduction id, the dates overlap. The system now validates that no overlap occurs. </P>
 <P><FONT style="font-weight:bold; " >Additional Options:</FONT><FONT style="font-weight:bold; " > Amount Type</FONT><FONT style="font-weight:bold; " ><BR></FONT>Percent Plus –  if this Amount Type is selected, the system will add wages and fringes that are flagged as true for Include in Wage Basis in the Earning Group record.</P>
 <H2>8.18 Void Payroll Checks – Payroll Miscellaneous Deduction Checks</H2>
 <P>In previous builds of 7.0, an Employee Check associated with one or more Payroll Miscellaneous Deduction Checks (PRMD) could only be voided it the PRMD Checks were voided first (using Void Payroll Check). This restriction has been relaxed: if a PRMD-type check has been produced, the system will now issue a warning to the user and let them decide whether or not to continue.  In this case, voiding the 2nd set of garnishment checks should be part of the user’s process.  As long as the garnishments are the same, a second set of garnishment checks wouldn't be required.&nbsp; Therefore, in that case, the user wouldn't have a second set of garnishment checks to void. A potential problem occurs if the garnishment checks can't be voided but the amounts have changed due to the voided and recomputed payroll.&nbsp; In that case, the user will be required to submit the net difference on a manual check or ask for a refund in the event of an overpayment.</P>
 <H2>8.19&nbsp;Show Canadian Vacation Pay as Fringe on PR Check</H2>
 <P><FONT style="font-weight:bold; " >Earnings Record: ‘Fringe On Check’ box<BR></FONT>The full functionality of this field has now been implemented: it would typically only be used for Canadian Vacation Pay. If the SAMPRO user wants the Vacation Benefit to appear as a 'fringe' on the PR Check, the Earnings record's 'Fringe on Check?' option must be set to True.&nbsp; With this option On, the check will continue to show the sum of the earnings as the hourly rate but it will also include the amount paid for the Vacation Benefit in the Fringes section of the check stub.&nbsp; This means the user should also enter a value in the Earnings record's Check Label field.</P>
 <P><FONT style="font-weight:bold; " >Setup:</FONT><FONT style="font-weight:bold; " > </FONT>Note that in the Earnings Record (for Canadian Vacation pay), the Type would be set to Wage so that the employee has the amount added into each hour's pay.&nbsp; Typically, this would not be Job Costed.<BR><FONT style="font-weight:bold; " >Employee Record or Earning Group:</FONT>&nbsp; Verify that the applicable Earnings is included in the Earnings list. By Canadian law, the Amount is either 4 percent or 6 percent of wages.&nbsp; The Add Pay Rate Factor should be set to True.&nbsp; </P>
 <P><FONT style="font-weight:bold; " >Reporting:</FONT> It is important to note that in the case of a $10/hour wage rate and 4% Vacation Benefit, the Regular Pay Rate is $10.40 as far as SAMPRO is concerned.&nbsp; That means all SAMPRO reports, including the PR Check, will show the rate as $10.40.</P>
 <H2>8.20 Positive Pay Report</H2>
 <P>PR checks that were paid via EFT are now excluded from the positive pay report. </P>
 <P>The Check Number has been added as a Range field to this report so that the user may filter the printed and electronic versions of the report by the Check Id. </P>
 <H2>8.21 Report Payroll Check</H2>
 <P>The Pay Rate that is printed on the check stub has been expanded to printed two digits to the left of the decimal point; in previous releases, only two digits were displayed (e.g, $99.99).</P>
 <P>Corrects a problem that resulted in exaggerated fringe YTD amounts being printed on the check stub if a person had differing rates for their fringes (regular jobs vs. prevailing wage).&nbsp;</P>
 <P>This release corrects the display of extraneous % signs for % type fringes.</P>
 <P><FONT style="font-weight:bold; " >Direct Deposit Payroll checks:</FONT> Only the last four digits of the employee’s bank account number (used for direct deposit) will now be printed on the PR check stub; the other digits will be replaced by *s.&nbsp; </P>
 <P><FONT style="font-weight:bold; " >Post PR Checks – Employee Id and Name a</FONT><FONT style="font-weight:bold; " >dded to Progress I</FONT><FONT style="font-weight:bold; " >ndicator</FONT><FONT style="font-weight:bold; " ><BR></FONT>This feature was added as a result of a problem posting a relatively large batch of checks. In the event that this problem recurs, the issue can most likely be resolved by following these steps.</P>
 <P>1. The user running the post acknowledges all error message prompts being sure to note which employee is specified on the progress indicated when the post fails.<BR>2. The user next logs completely out of SAMPRO to ensure a rollback of partially posted data.<BR>3. The user should rerun the PR Checks without the 'offending' employee and print and post them.<BR>4. The PR Check for the 'offending' employee should be printed and posted.</P>

 <H2>8.25 Report W2 Electronic File </H2>
 <P>(RW2EF.rpt dated 4/28/2010 – versions 7.0 and up)</P>
 <P>This new report provides generalized support for State and Local magnetic media reporting for all state and local authorities that accept the federal (IRS/SSA) file definitions.&nbsp;Note that special processing for CA, KS, KY and MN is also supported for this report. </P>
 <P><FONT style="font-weight:bold; " >New Field on the Report W2 Electronic File Range Screen: Local/Other Authority</FONT></P>

 <H1>9 Service</H1>
 <H2>9.1 Work Order Viewer</H2>
 <P>This release corrects an error that occurred when selecting a Flat Rate from the list in the Import Flat Rate window.</P>
 <P>The user is now prevented from selecting the Import Costs button if a work order is not loaded in the work order viewer.</P>
 <P><FONT style="font-weight:bold; " >Work Order Invoicing</FONT></P>
 <P>SAM Pro validates each PO line individually to see if anything is unvouchered. If the registry setting to not allow invoicing of work orders with unvouchered PO’s is set<FONT style="font-weight:bold; " > </FONT><FONT style="font-weight:bold; " >(</FONT>OkToBillWithOpenPOs=false in sys-viewer-vwrkordr), it was not allowing Work Orders with Credit PO’s to be invoiced. This problem has been corrected; see case for details. </P>
 <P><FONT style="font-weight:bold; " >Enhanced Validation</FONT></P>
 <P>Enhanced validation has been added to correct sporadic problems where the Work Order and Job History got out of sync if Work Order lines were deleted. The following validations are now performed when a work order is saved:</P>
 <P style="margin-left:36.00pt;">WO-LAB Hours vs. JCH Hours<BR>WO-INV Costs vs. JCH Costs<BR>WO-OTH Costs vs. JCH Costs<BR>WO-RevAdj Revenue vs. JCH Revenue</P>
 <P>In addition, validation has been added to ensure that Work Order lines that have been invoiced are not changed immediately after the Service Invoice Post has been run, but before the Work Order has been exited – resulting in the Work Order and Job History being out of synch. </P>
 <P><FONT style="font-weight:bold; " >Credit Hold Work Orders: Important Change to Default Behavior</FONT></P>
 <P>A Credit Manager must now clear the Credit Hold flag on a Work Order before time or materials may be added to it from the Work Order or Labor Journal. </P>
 <P><FONT style="font-weight:bold; " >Quoted Lines</FONT></P>
 <P>This change applies to the Labor, Inventory and Other tabs of work orders that are <FONT style="text-decoration:underline;" >not</FONT> associated with a Quote.&nbsp; This validation prevents an 'actual' line (that has already been saved into the database) from being switched to a Quote-type line. Note that the Quote box of Work Orders associated with a Quote still cannot be changed at all. </P>
 <P><FONT style="font-weight:bold; " >Flat Rate Import</FONT></P>
 <P style="margin-left:36.00pt;"><FONT style="font-weight:bold; " >Equipment Id:</FONT> In previous releases, the Equipment Id was left blank in the Labor, Inventory, and Other tabs when importing Flat Rates (via the Flat Rate button).&nbsp; The system now defaults in the Equipment Id from the first line of the Equipment tab.</P>
 <P style="margin-left:36.00pt;"><FONT style="font-weight:bold; " >Inventory Items: </FONT>This enhancement applies to Flat Rate Categories with Inventory lines that do not specify a unit/extended cost. In previous releases, when the Flat Rate was imported into a work order a zero cost was defaulting. This has been corrected so that the cost is now defaulted based on the rules specified in the Inventory record. If a Technician is specified in the Import, costing will be based on the default location for that Technician. If a Technician is not specified, the Location will not be defaulted, and overall costing for that item will be used. </P>
 <P><FONT style="font-weight:bold; " >Calculating Revenue with Margin, Markup and Multiplier</FONT></P>
 <P>In previous releases, if you used a Bill Type of Margin, Markup, or Multiplier the system didn’t react to the quantity billed being zero and still extended out the revenue based on the actual quantity. The code now forces the Extended Revenue to zero whenever the Bill Quantity is set to zero. The Extended Revenue may then be changed to a non-zero value if needed. This change effects revenue calculations in the AP Journal, Inventory Receipts Journal, Record Billing Adjustments, Job Journal, Labor Journal, Purchase Order, Quote and Worker Order viewers. </P>
 <P><FONT style="font-weight:bold; " >Creating Work Orders</FONT></P>
 <P>By default, users are no longer permitted to create work orders from the Work Order viewer.  If your firm regularly does so without problems, contact your support representative for an internal registry setting to enable the add button.</P>
 <P><FONT style="font-weight:bold; " >Importing PO’s</FONT></P>
 <P>When a PO is created for a Work Order, an Equipment Id is not specified on it. When the PO is imported the system sets the Equipment Id as follows:</P>
 <P style="margin-left:36.00pt;">- If a work order has only one piece of equipment, that piece of equipment will default when a PO is imported into a Work Order. </P>
 <P style="margin-left:36.00pt;">-  If a work order has more than one piece of equipment, the equipment id is NOT set on the import from the PO. However, you may edit the detail line and select the equipment. When you save the work order, the equipment you specified will be record in JC history and appear on the Revenues tab. </P>
 <P style="margin-left:36.00pt;">In addition, the WO Revenues tab has been updated to display the Equipment Id. </P>
 <P><FONT style="font-weight:bold; " >Import Costs Button:<BR></FONT>The WO Import Costs function has been modified to include labor lines that have hours but zero cost and zero revenue. The Revenues tab also been modified so that entries with quantities and/or hours will show as detail lines.&nbsp; Prior to this change, lines that had zero cost and zero revenue would get included in the Totals line's values but would not appear as detail lines.</P>
 <H3>9.1.1  Technicians Tab</H3>
 <P>Two new log types and escalation statuses, Checked Out and Rescheduled, have been added to be used in with SubAnywhere. Tech Declined has been added as an escalation status.</P>
 <P>A unique key has been added that requires that, for each Work Order the Technician + Date Scheduled on the Tech Tab lines will be unique.&nbsp; This index will be created when your database is converted to version 7.0. However, this index can't be created in a database that already violates the uniqueness constraint.  Your support representative can correct this problem if access to your database is available. </P>
 <P>In previous releases, Insert with copy was only copying the Tech Id.  This functionality has been enhanced so that all fields except the date are copied – and the user is warned that this is the case. Note that the same technician should never be scheduled for the same date twice on the same WO. </P>
 <H3>9.1.2 Gross Margin Tab</H3>
 <P>A new registry option (see user notes section 2.2) enables the Employer portion of PR Taxes (FUTA, FICA, etc) will be imported to the WorkOrder (as part of the Import Costs functionality) from the Payroll Check Journal. This enables all costs to be viewable on the Gross Margin tab of the workorder.&nbsp; Note that these costs will be imported without any revenue.&nbsp;</P>
 <H3>9.1.3 Invoicing Tab</H3>
 <P><FONT style="font-weight:bold; " >Print Worksheet Button <BR></FONT>In previous versions, the Print Worksheet button enabled users’ access to execute the function/report if their user group had access to Service Billing Compute. The system now checks for Service Billing Working access instead. </P>
 <P>This release also corrects a problem where the service worksheet did not archive or save as an attachment on the WO, job, &amp; Client records.&nbsp;</P>
 <P>The Print Invoice button is once again disabled if the OK to Invoice box is cleared. </P>
 <H3>9.1.4 Inventory Tab</H3>
 <P>Validation has been added to ensure that an accounting period is specified for all Work Order Inventory lines that are not flagged as quotes or were imported from job history. </P>
 <P><FONT style="font-weight:bold; " >Deleting Inventory Lines if Accounting Period is Inactive</FONT></P>
 <P>In previous releases, although the user had to change the Accounting Period Id to an active one before deleting a WO Inventory line, the system posted the reversal to the Inactive period. The code has been changed to prevent this.  The appropriate process for 'deleting' with closed period lines is to:</P>
 <P style="margin-left:36.00pt;">a) Switch to an active period (use the Magnify button to access this field) and zero out the quantity.&nbsp; </P>
 <P style="margin-left:36.00pt;">b) Save the WO with an active period.</P>
 <P style="margin-left:36.00pt;">c) Delete the line and re-save the record.&nbsp;</P>
 <P>When posting occurs, the reversing entries will use the new period and effective dates.&nbsp; </P>
 <P><FONT style="font-weight:bold; " >Lot Controlled Items</FONT></P>
 <P>When adding lot-controlled items to the Work Order Inventory tab, the Vendor’s Serial/Lot Number is now displayed on the detail view (accessed by clicking the Magnify button on the WO Inventory tab). Note that when you click on the Serial/Lot field to select from a list of Lot numbers, the InventoryItemSerializedbyIdbyItem sort order displays the Vendor’s Lot number. </P>
 <P><FONT style="font-weight:bold; " >Quantity Billed</FONT></P>
 <P>In previous releases, if you used a Bill Type of Margin, Markup, or Multiplier the system didn’t react to the quantity billed being set to zero and still extended out the revenue based on the actual quantity. The code now forces the Extended Revenue to zero whenever the Bill Quantity is set to zero. The Extended Revenue may then be changed to a non-zero value if needed. </P>
 <P><FONT style="font-weight:bold; " >Quote-type lines </FONT>no longer post to GL since they never become Actual Job Costs.</P>
 <P>Accounting period validation (for deleting line) now retrieves the status from the database instead of depending on the cached value.</P>
 <P>The system now sets the work order<FONT style="font-weight:bold; " > </FONT><FONT style="font-weight:bold; " >I</FONT><FONT style="font-weight:bold; " >nvento</FONT><FONT style="font-weight:bold; " >ry D</FONT><FONT style="font-weight:bold; " >escription</FONT> using the Price Code and the Inventory Price Exceptions tables (shown on the Inventory Item Pricing tab).  This description prints on several of the invoice formats. </P>
 <P>Corrects problem where the<FONT style="font-weight:bold; " > GL Entity</FONT> was blanked if the quantity was initially set to 0, and then changed. The GL Entity will now always default as follows: First from the Job Cost Code, next from the Location, last from the Inventory Group.</P>
 <P><FONT style="font-weight:bold; " >Changed Field: Serial / Lot Id<BR></FONT>If a serialized Inventory Item is specified, double-clicking on the Serial / Lot Id field now displays a filtered list of all (used and unused) serial numbers for that item. In previous releases, the list included numbers for all serial and lot-controlled items. The Serial/Lot number may now be recorded on Inventory lines imported from job history. </P>
 <P><FONT style="font-weight:bold; " >Serialized Inventory Validation</FONT><FONT style="font-weight:bold; " ><BR></FONT>In previous releases, you could select a serialized item from any location regardless of whether or not it was onhand at that location. Validation has been added so that the system does not allow you to enter/select a serial number on the WO Inventory tab unless it exists that the selected location (on the line) as a positive on hand quantity.</P>
 <P><FONT style="font-weight:bold; " >Quoted Lines</FONT><FONT style="font-weight:bold; " > </FONT><FONT style="font-weight:bold; " ><BR></FONT>Corrects problem where Quoted lines were erroneously writing to IM history when a WO was invoiced. </P>
 <P style="margin-top:0;margin-bottom:0">&nbsp;</P>
 <H3>9.1.5 Labor Tab</H3>
 <P><FONT style="font-weight:bold; " >Prevailing Wages:</FONT> corrects problems when the useCostCodeWorkType=true option is implemented. If the Cost Code is set to Field, Prevailing Wages/Costs will be in effect (if the Employee is attached to the prevailing wage job). If the Cost Code is set to Office, cost and wage information will be pulled from the Employee record. </P>
 <P><FONT style="font-weight:bold; " >Validations</FONT><FONT style="font-weight:bold; " > on Quoted Lines</FONT><FONT style="font-weight:bold; " >: </FONT></P>
 <P style="text-indent:30.25pt;">- If the WO is associated with a quote, date/pr period validation is ignored on quoted labor lines. </P>
 <P style="margin-left:36.00pt;">- If WO is NOT associated with a quote, date/pr period validation still occurs on quoted lines if the pr period is filled in.</P>
 <P><FONT style="font-weight:bold; " >New Fields: Total Hours Worked   Total Hours Billed<BR></FONT>These display-only fields are maintained by the system. Note that you must Save the Work Order to view the revised total for any lines that you have added or changed.</P>
 <H3>9.1.6  Other Tab</H3>
 <P>Corrects problem where Billing Type was set to n/a and a Revenue Amount entered manually.  If another field (Job Id, CostCode Id, BillItem Id, OtherRate Id, CostCategory Id or TaxTypeId) was then changed, the Unit Price and Revenue Amount were zeroed out.  With this release, the Revenue Amount is retained if the Billing Type is n/a.</P>
 <P>Where you cannot change the Cost Category directly on lines imported from JCH you could still change these via the Other Rate ID.&nbsp; Although you are still allowed to change the Other Rate Id on imported lines, the original cost category is not changed.</P>
 <P>In previous releases, if you used a Bill Type of Margin, Markup, or Multiplier the system didn’t react to the quantity billed being set to zero and still extended out the revenue based on the actual quantity. The code now forces the Extended Revenue to zero whenever the Bill Quantity is set to zero. The Extended Revenue may then be changed to a non-zero value if needed. </P>
 <H3>9.1.7 Revenue Tab</H3>
 <P>Separate columns for Hours and Labor Cost have been added to the WO viewer's Revenues tab.</P>
 <H3>9.1.8 Main Tab</H3>
 <P>Fixes non-default Billing Item display problem.</P>
 <P><FONT style="font-weight:bold; " >New Field: </FONT></P>
 <P><FONT style="font-weight:bold; " >Service Category:<BR></FONT>This field is set when the work order is created but may be changed by the user if needed. It is used by CRMAnywhere in conjunction with the Web User's Service Category filtering to Equipment and WO lists – only WO with blank service categories or those that match the Web User’s will appear in the Equipment and WO lists. </P>
 <P><FONT style="font-weight:bold; " >Note: </FONT>this field was set in<FONT style="font-weight:bold; " > </FONT>New Call in previous versions. For PM Work Order, this field will now be set from the PM Inspection Work Code first and the Equipment record second.</P>
 <H3>9.1.9 Revenue Adjustments: </H3>
 <P>Corrects a problem where the system was not using the correct Revenue Adjustment table when the Compute Revenue button was clicked. This only occurred if Exceptions were included on any Revenue Adjustment table. </P>
 <P style="margin-top:0;margin-bottom:0">&nbsp;</P>
 <H2>9.2 Dispatch Board</H2>
 <P><FONT style="font-weight:bold; " >Filters:</FONT> In previous releases, the filter for the Account Manager and Sales Rep Id's ranges referenced the Client Site values. In this release, the system references the Id's found in the Work Order header (which default from the Site but may be changed by the user).</P>
 <P><FONT style="font-weight:bold; " >New</FONT><FONT style="font-weight:bold; " > RTD Export Button</FONT><FONT style="font-weight:bold; " >: </FONT>This new button is used in conjunction with the new Remote Tech Device - TechAnywhere/Blackberry functionality.  When pressed, this button will export an RTD XML file for the currently selected dispatch line. Note that this button is only enabled if the selected work order line is eligible for export (e.g., it is of the correct status, and is assigned to Technician with the correct web access). </P>
 <P>When the dispatch board registry is set to: SaveRanges=true and PreferencesByBoard=yes, the Log Type Id range values were not being updated when the board was switched. This has been corrected. </P>
 <P>The work order’s Service Zone has been added to the Time Chart Pane.</P>
 <P>Error Starting Dispatch Board from Folders viewer corrected.</P>
 <P>F2 sets the tech status of the selected Work Order to Waiting Parts.</P>
 <P>Problem saving changes in Update Work Order corrected. </P>
 <P>The 'uncompleted' filter now includes the statuses of 'wait paperwork' and 'parts received'.</P>
 <P>The Job Id has been added to the Filter Ranges. If this range is completed, work order will be limited to those whose Job Id (on the Work Order Main tab) matches the Job Id(s) specified in this range. Note that you must tab down to access this range. </P>
 <H3>9.2.1 Classic Dispatch Board</H3>
 <P>The Classic/Day Board row/column titles are now properly refreshed when Date Scheduled is changed; this problem occurred due to the performance enhancements made to earlier versions of the software.</P>
 <P style="margin-left:36.00pt;"><FONT style="font-weight:bold; " >Important Note Registry Entries for Classic and Day Boards:</FONT></P>
 <P style="margin-left:36.00pt;">The Classic / Day Board performance enhancements seem to have changed the way in which the Hours fields in the information cells are refreshed. The Hours field is a 7 character field, and is now displayed as left justified. This means that if the Classic or Day boards are configured via a custom registry setting, and the Hours field is specified as less than 7 characters, all of the digits will not display (for example, 12.50 will appear as 12. if 5 characters are specified via registry). </P>
 <P>The Release to Tech button on the side button bar now functions correctly when the Classic and Day boards are displayed. Previously, this button only functioned correctly when the Power board was displayed.</P>
 <P>Performance enhancements have been implemented that should reduce the time to perform such functions as drag and drop, opening the board, and selecting a dispatch. </P>
 <P style="margin-left:36.00pt;"><FONT style="font-weight:bold; " >Performance Tip:</FONT>  Although the Classic Board looks at only one day at a time, its performance is impacted by the Date Range selected on the Power Board. If you select This Week instead of This Month (for example), less Work Orders would be on the Power Board, improving Classic Board performance. </P>
 <P>The last column on the Classic Board was extraneous, displaying an error if the user double-clicked on it.  The extraneous column has been removed and the error eliminated.  </P>
 <P class="Reference_Line" style="margin-bottom:0.00pt;">Corrects error that occurred when selecting a line in the lower half of the board where the technician is unassigned, then right-clicking to display the wo summary.  If you entered a Tech Id and then saved, the error appeared.  </P>
 <P class="Reference_Line" style="margin-bottom:0.00pt;"><FONT style="font-weight:bold; " >Drag and Drop Copy is </FONT><FONT style="font-weight:bold; " >now </FONT><FONT style="font-weight:bold; " >supported</FONT></P>
 <P class="Reference_Line" style="margin-bottom:0.00pt;">In the Classic Board, can now add a tech line by <FONT style="font-weight:bold; " >right-clicking</FONT> a cell, and then dragging it to the cell of the tech you want to add. When you drop the cell, a menu appears. When you select copy, the new tech will be added to the work order, and the existing tech will still be on it. The normal rules for setting the initial status of a tech assigned to a WO apply. </P>
 <P><FONT style="font-weight:bold; " >Graphic Time Chart Support </FONT><FONT style="font-weight:bold; " >and Other Enhancements</FONT></P>
 <P><IMG src="images/all_wo.gif" border=0 height=35 width=63 alt="images\all_wo.gif"> A new button, Show All WOs, has been added to the top button of the Classic / Day boards. When clicked, all work orders included on the classic board will be displayed on the bottom half of the screen (in the work order list or graphic time chart modes). </P>
 <P><IMG src="images/chart.gif" border=0 height=28 width=48 alt="images\chart.gif"> The Time Chart button has been enabled in the Classic and Day boards. The Graphic Time Chart button enables you to toggle between the graphic and text display of the workorder list. <FONT style="font-weight:bold; " >The graphic view is designed to work best with the Technician/Date/Time and Date/Technician/Time sort orders.</FONT>  To switch to the graphic time chart, simply click on the Chart button. To switch back to the text version, simply click on the Chart button again. </P>
 <P>For each WorkOrder, the following information appears at the left of the time chart (when you position the cursor over the time block for a workorder, the status line displays additional information for that workorder): </P>
 <P>Date Scheduled | Technician | Client Site Alpha | </P>
 <P>The column following Client Site Alpha may either be blank or contain dashes (----) or stars (**).  </P>
 <P>&nbsp;---- Dashes indicate that the work orders for the next technician begin <BR>&nbsp;**   Stars indicate that a call is in conflict (regardless of the sort order selected) <BR>&nbsp;      Blanks indicate an additional call(s) for the same technician that is not in conflict </P>
 <P><FONT style="font-weight:bold; " >Changing the Time Scheduled of a Dispatch in Graphics Mode </FONT></P>
 <P>When the Work Order List is displayed in the Graphic Time Chart mode, the following steps can be implemented to change the Time Scheduled of a dispatch: </P>
 <P><FONT style="font-weight:bold; " >1.</FONT> Using the left mouse button, click once on the dispatch you want to reschedule in the time chart. <BR><FONT style="font-weight:bold; " >2.</FONT> Using the left mouse button again, click on the time (on that Tech's time line) you want to reschedule the dispatch. <BR><FONT style="font-weight:bold; " >3.</FONT> The caret is now located at the time you want the dispatch to begin. Using the <FONT style="font-weight:bold; " >right</FONT> mouse button, click on the caret to actually reschedule the dispatch.</P>
 <H3>9.2.2 WO Id Added to Sort</H3>
 <P>The rows were previously sorted by date, call sequence, time. In the case of generating PM WO's the date and time are always the same with the call sequence being 0, they were displayed in a seemingly random order. WO Id has been added as a sort criterion – so if all dates, time and call sequences are identical, WO’s will be listed by Id. </P>
 <P>Also see section 2.15 of these user notes for a registry entry to set the initial sequence number of PM WorkOrders. </P>
 <H2>9.3 New Call</H2>
 <P>Corrects a sporadic problem involving the sys-newcall registry setting 'SkipSiteListOnLoad'.</P>
 <P>Call sequencing is now disabled when no tech has been assigned when a work order is created in New Call. This is to prevent an overflow error that could occur if 999 or more unassigned pm’s were created, and then a new assigned work order was generated in New Call, when previously forced the sequencing. </P>
 <P>If a User selects a Site whose status is set to Credit Hold, they will be alerted, and the WO will be marked as on Credit Hold.</P>
 <P>Corrects problem that only occurred if the site equipment lacked default job, cost code and billing items. If you selected the site and then entered the job and cost code before selecting the equipment, the default billing item (from the cost code) did NOT default in.   </P>
 <P>In version 6.2, clicking the Refresh button would re-cache the site list - enabling the user to see changes he has just made to the site record. This functionality has been restored.</P>
 <P>Focus now returns to New Call’s Priority field when the work code’s Call Script window is closed.   In previous releases, the focus was lost and the user had to click on a field to continue.</P>
 <P>Corrects problem where new Job’s Template field was not cleared on creation from back screen of New Call. </P>
 <P>Call Sequencing: PM Invoice-type WOs are now excluded from re-sequencing.&nbsp; </P>

 <P class="Tip_Note_Heading" style="margin-top:4.00pt;">New Fields: </P>
 <P class="Tip_Note_Heading" style="margin-top:4.00pt;">Skip Saturdays:  Skip Sundays:</P>
 <P class="Reference_Line" style="margin-bottom:0.00pt;">If one or both of these fields are checked, the scheduled event manager will skip Saturdays and or Sundays when generating scheduled events.  The event will be scheduled either before or after the weekend according to the following:</P>
 <P style="margin-left:23.75pt;">-&nbsp;If a <FONT style="font-weight:bold; " >positive</FONT> value is specified in the Days, Hours or Minutes field, and the event would fall on a day that should be skipped, the event will be scheduled for the first day after the last skipped day</P>
 <P style="margin-left:23.75pt;">-&nbsp;If a <FONT style="font-weight:bold; " >negative</FONT> value is specified in the Days, Hours or Minutes field, and the event would fall on a day that should be skipped, the event will be scheduled for the day before the first skipped day</P>
 <P style="margin-left:23.75pt;"><FONT style="text-decoration:underline;" >Example:</FONT></P>
 <P style="margin-left:23.75pt;">Assume the following:</P>
 <P style="margin-left:23.75pt;">Profile Source: workorder&nbsp;Profile Action: notification</P>
 <P style="margin-left:23.75pt;">Status From: any&nbsp;&nbsp;Status To: waiting service</P>
 <P style="margin-left:23.75pt;">Days: -1&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Profile Time: scheduled</P>
 <P style="margin-left:23.75pt;">Skip Saturday: X&nbsp;&nbsp;Skip Sunday: X</P>
 <P style="margin-left:23.75pt;">We will assume that all work orders are initially set to waiting service in this example, and that our technician is assigned to a work order scheduled for next Monday.  Without the weekend days being checked, the tech would receive his notification on Sunday – not too useful if he doesn’t check email on the weekend.  With the Skip days checked, his notification would arrive on Friday at the time scheduled. </P>
 <H2>9.5  Master Contract</H2>
 <P>Improvements in the way the way Start Create PM Work Orders / Billings Date handle dates are checked have been made so that multiple years can be used in the master contract.</P>
 <H3>Client Site Status </H3>
 <P>When the Start Create PM WO’s and Start Create PM Billing functions are run, Client Site Equipment PM Schedule and Client Site PM Billing lines will <FONT style="text-decoration:underline;" >not</FONT> be generated from the Master Contract record if the Client Site status is set to Inactive or Mail List.  Lines will be generated for Sites whose status is set to Credit Hold. PM Work Orders that are ultimately generated for Credit Hold sites will be set to Credit Hold, and must be released by a Credit Manager. </P>
 <H3>Master Contract Now Supports Multiple Tasks / Contracts</H3>
 <P>Master Contract processing has been enhanced to accommodate multiple tasks for PM’s scheduled on the same date and equipment. For example, if your Master Contract Schedule tab includes two lines for the same day and month, but with different Service Task Id’s, two corresponding lines will be generated to the Client Site Equipment PM Schedule tab, and then to the PM Work Order Equipment tab when Create PM Work Orders is run. </P>
 <P>In addition, Master Contract processing has been enhanced to accommodate multiple contracts per Site. The following will occur when Start Create PM Work Orders is run for Sites whose equipment is associated with one or more Master Contracts: &nbsp; </P>
 <P style="margin-left:36.00pt;">- A Client Site Equipment records that is flagged as Active and Under Contract – but <FONT style="text-decoration:underline;" >does not</FONT> specify a Contract Id qualify for ALL Contracts that include the equipment's Site record.&nbsp; </P>
 <P style="margin-left:36.00pt;">- A Client Site Equipment record that is flagged as Active and Under Contract that <FONT style="text-decoration:underline;" >does</FONT> specify a Contract Id will ONLY be included as part of the specified Contract.&nbsp; </P>
 <P>Note that separate work orders will be created for the different Contracts.</P>
 <H3>Master Contract Validations</H3>
 <P>Since Master Contract Processing now supports multiple contracts per Site, enhanced functionality and validations have been added to the Master Contract viewer to support this. </P>
 <P style="margin-left:36.00pt;">1. Each time a Site Id is added to the Site List tab, the user will be prompted with a warning message if the Site is referenced on another Master Contract.&nbsp; </P>
 <P style="margin-left:36.00pt;">2. The Equipment tab right-click action has been enhanced to allow the user to change the Contract the Equipment is assigned to. When the Equipment record is already under contract on a different Master Contract, the right-click generates the following message: </P>
 <P style="margin-left:72.00pt;">Selected Equipment record is already covered by another contract.<BR>Do you wish to reassign it to this contract?</P>
 <P style="margin-left:36.00pt;">Click Yes to reassign the Equipment to the current Contract. Note, however, that to remove Equipment from all Master Contracts, you must do so from the Master Contract record to which is currently assigned.  </P>
 <P style="margin-left:36.00pt;">3. The Equipment tab now displays the equipment records for every site listed on the Site List tab when the Master Contract Record is in Add mode.&nbsp;</P>
 <P style="margin-left:36.00pt;">4. However, a new Master Contract record must be saved before doing any right-click processing on Equipment tab. If the user attempts to do so, he will be prompted that the Master Contract record must be saved first.</P>

 <H2>9.6 New Function:  Renew Master Contract</H2>
 <H2>Purpose:</H2>
 <P>Uses the existing information in the Master Contract to revise this record when a contract is renewed. A year will be added to the End Date of each Contract that you renew with this function.</P>
 <H2>Usage: </H2>
 <P>The Renewable? flag in the Master Contract record must be checked for it to be eligible for update via this function. </P>
 <P>If you are updating your contract with this function, be sure that all PM’s and Billings for the current contract year have already been generated (with the Create PM WO’s and Create PM Billings functions) before you proceed with the update.   </P>
 <P>Alternately, the Renew/Setup tab of the Master Contract (see section 9.5 of these release notes) may be used to update your Master Contracts.</P>
 <H2>Important Fields: Range Screen </H2>
 <P><FONT style="font-weight:bold; " >Start Expiration Date&nbsp;End Expiration Date<BR></FONT>These required fields define the range of End Dates of the Contracts that you wish to renew.  For example, to update all Master Contracts that expire in January of 2007, you would enter 01012007 for the Start Expiration Date and 01312007 for the End Expiration Date.</P>
 <P><FONT style="font-weight:bold; " >Escalation Percent<BR></FONT>This field enables you to automatically escalate the Amount Billed and the Amount Earned fields in the Master Contract Adv. Bill tab.  For example, to escalate the contract by 7%, you would simply enter 7.  Note that when you click the Go button to run this function, a checklist will appear. At this point, you may hand-edit the New Value field if needed. </P>
 <P><FONT style="font-weight:bold; " >Value Adjustment Type:  Round    Truncate   None<BR></FONT>This field defines how adjusted contract totals with partial dollar amounts will be handled.  By default, amounts will be Rounded up or down to the next whole dollar value. Alternately, you may select Truncate or None by double-clicking on the adjacent radio button. </P>
 <P><FONT style="font-weight:bold; " >Default Distribution:  o  Weighted      o Even<BR></FONT>This field sets the default payment distribution method for the Renew Service Contract Checklist screen. It controls how the dollar amounts in the renewed billing schedule will be distributed.  By default, this option is set to ‘Weighted’.  Selecting this option results in each new billable amount being proportionally increased by the escalation percentage. This result is displayed in the ‘Weighted’ column in the example below. </P>
 <P class="Block_Text" >If you select the Even option, the system will ‘smooth’ the billing schedule so that all payments are the same (or within a few pennies of each other).  This result is shown in the ‘Even’ column in the following example. Note that in both cases, the Total Contract amount is increased by 10% exactly.  </P>
 <P style="margin-left:36.00pt;">Example:</P>
 <P style="margin-left:36.00pt;">Escalation Percent: 10%   Value Adjustment Type:  Round</P>

 <P><FONT style="font-weight:bold; " >Master Contract Id:<BR></FONT>To update specific Master Contract, enter the applicable Master Contract Id.  Several Id's can be specified by separating their Id's with a comma (243,3645,3554). </P>
 <P><FONT style="font-weight:bold; " >Agreement Type Id:<BR></FONT>To restrict the update to a specific type of agreement, enter the appropriate Agreement Type Id.  Several Id's can be specified by separating their Id's with a comma (pmfull,pmlabor).</P>
 <P><FONT style="font-weight:bold; " >Sales Rep Id:<BR></FONT>To restrict the update to only those contracts assigned to a specific Sales Rep, enter the appropriate Sales Rep Id. Several Id's can be specified by separating their Id's with a comma (TimC,JoeT).</P>

 <H2>9.7 Create PM WorkOrders </H2>
 <P>If a PO is created for a Subcontractor tech, the PO # is now written to that line in the Tech tab.</P>
 <P>Corrects a problem that occurred using the registry setting sys-start-scrtepmwo line MarkContractValueEntryAsQuoted=false.  The software now posts the Work Order Other 'contract value' entry to JCH as the Total Revenue when this registry entry is set and Start Create PM Work Orders is run.</P>
 <P>The system was failing to generate any PM Invoice work orders if Master Contract data was not configured correctly. The software now skips incorrectly configured records. </P>
 <P>This function is now sensitive to the status of the Site as well as to the Job Date Closed in order to exclude undesirable PM Inspections from creation. The following validations now apply: </P>
 <P style="margin-left:36.00pt;">1. If the Equipment’s Site is not Active or Credit Hold, do not create PM Work Orders for it. PM Work Orders that are created for Credit Hold Sites will be flagged as Credit Hold, and must be released by a Credit Manager.<BR>2. If the Job in the Equipment PM schedule has a Job Date Closed that precedes the Inspection Date, do not create a PM Work Order for it.</P>
 <P>In addition, Inactive Sites and Closed Jobs are now skipped in the Master Contract processing phase; lines will not be written to the Client Site Equipment PM Schedule in these cases. </P>
 <P>This release also corrects ‘placeholder’ problem related for Master Contract processing where only the user that started the Create PM Work Order process it could finish it. </P>
 <P>A Master Contract Id range has been added to this function. </P>
 <P>Also see user notes section 2.15 for many new registry options for this function. </P>
 <P>The system now automatically writes the date scheduled for the PM work order to the Date Earliest Start and sets the Date Must Complete to the last day of the month specified in date scheduled during PM work order generation.</P>
 <P>If the Work Order is being generated for a sub, the automatically generated PO Id will once again be written to the Work Order PO Id field in the Main tab. </P>
 <P>The WO parent Service Category will now be set from the PM Inspection Work Code first and the Equipment record second. The Service Category was not previously set by this function. </P>
 <P>The system now associates the WO Equipment with OTHER Time of Service Revenue.</P>
 <H2>9.8 Create PM Billing</H2>
 <P>This function is now sensitive to the status of the Site as well as to the Job Date Closed in order to exclude undesirable PM Billings from creation. The following validations now apply: </P>
 <P style="margin-left:36.00pt;">1. If the Site is not Active or Credit Hold, do not create a PM Billing entry for it (note: this no longer excludes Credit Hold Sites).<BR>2. If the Job in the Client Site PM Billing schedule has a Job Date Closed that precedes the Billing Date, do not create a Billing Entry for it.</P>
 <P>A Master Contract Id range has been added to this function.</P>
 <P>See user notes section 2.31 for new registry options for this function. </P>
 <P>Corrects errors present in writing accrual entries in beta versions of 7.0.</P>
 <P>Assume the PM WO Invoicing is in effect: CreatePMInvoiceWO=true option is in sys-start-scrtepmwo. This release  corrects a problem where the system was using the last date of the period as the effective date for job cost and the bill date on the workorder.</P>
 <P style="margin-left:36.00pt;"><FONT style="font-weight:bold; " >Important Note on Amounts Earned:</FONT> When PM Billing amounts earned are written to GL, a single transaction is made for the run, with the effective date as the last date of the period. When GL writes to JCH, this is the only date the system knows to use. Short of changing the software to make individual GL entries for each PM Billing, this is how it works. Note that a separate accounting period could be used to generate accruals to a date before the month.</P>
 <H2>9.9 Start Edit Daily Work Orders</H2>
 <P>Corrects ‘fetch error’ when Technician ld was selected from list.  This release also corrects the 'non-continuable protection violation' error that occurred when the user exited SAM Pro by clicking the Quit button on the Start Work Order Daily Edit checklist screen. </P>
 <P><FONT style="font-weight:bold; " >New Ranges:</FONT></P>
 <P>The following filter ranges have been added to the Edit Daily Work Orders selection screen:</P>
 <P><FONT style="font-weight:bold; " >Employee Type</FONT> <BR><FONT style="font-weight:bold; " >Account Manager Id</FONT> <BR><FONT style="font-weight:bold; " >Dispatcher Id</FONT> <BR><FONT style="font-weight:bold; " >Service Manager Id</FONT> <BR><FONT style="font-weight:bold; " >Sales Rep Id</FONT> <BR><BR><FONT style="font-weight:bold; " >New Fields:</FONT></P>
 <P><FONT style="font-weight:bold; " >Retain Current Dates?<BR></FONT>The default value is False (blank).&nbsp; When changed to True (checked), the user is indicating that the current schedule dates should be retained then the selection list appears.</P>
 <P><FONT style="font-weight:bold; " >New Status:<BR></FONT>The default value is blank.&nbsp; If the user sets this field to a Status, then the selected Status becomes the new status for each entry that appears in the resulting selection list. Note that if you add/change a technician, the new log status will automatically be set to the applicable initial value for that technician for escalation management purposes. </P>
 <H2>9.10 Create New PM WO Schedule from Old</H2>
 <P>Corrects problem where the Invoice Description did not copy to new lines when this function was run. </P>
 <H2>9.11 TechFinder Viewer</H2>
 <P>Fixes SQL Server error launching TechFinder.</P>
 <P><FONT style="font-weight:bold; " >New Field - Original Technician</FONT>:<BR>This field displays the technician to whom the work order was originally assigned. If the work order was not a assigned to any technician, ‘unassigned’ will appear. </P>
 <H3>9.11.1 Reschedule Work Order Confirmation Box</H3>
 <P><FONT style="font-weight:bold; " >New Field - </FONT><FONT style="font-weight:bold; " >Additional Technician Box:<BR></FONT>If you check this box, the technician that you selected will be added to the Tech Tab of the work order, instead of replacing the original technician. </P>
 <H2>9.12 Report Work Order</H2>
 <P>Corrects problem where the report was printing one instance of each Service Task list in the CS Equipment head or PM Schedule lines. The report now lists Service Tasks on the WO itself, plus the CSE header task so as to retain its originally intended behavior. </P>
 <H2>9.13 Escalation Manager</H2>
 <P>This release corrects a problem that caused the primary tech to be used instead of the line tech in some cases where the token replacement ^wrkordrtchncn:tchncn_id^  was used. &nbsp;Note that the token replacements ^tchncn_id^ and ^wrkordrtchncn:tchncn_id^ are NOT the same: the former applies to the primary tech, and the latter to the tech on the technician tab.</P>
 <P>Event Mangers now correctly handle the case where Scheduled Event Manager posted items that TechAnywhere Event Manager had marked triggered. </P>
 <P><FONT style="font-weight:bold; " >Escalation Manager Pagination Problem<BR></FONT>Since reports launched by the escalation manager do not know which printer they will be sent to, the default length was being set to 60 lines per page in some cases – much too short for a portrait report. This release has been enhanced so that the scheduled report manager will look at the LinesPerPage= option in the sys-report-reportfunctionid registry setting when calculating the lines per page. Typically, somewhere between 78 and 80 lines would be appropriate for a portrait report.</P>
 <H2>9.14 Start Work Order Entry </H2>
 <P>This starter function has been enhanced so that the use may record inventory / other items if the payroll period crosses a month boundary, and the Accounting Period (referenced in the Pay Period) does not. The Accounting Period for Inventory/Other entries will now be based on the line's Work Date and the Pay Period's 'Prior Period Accruals' Period End Date.&nbsp; If the Work Date is less than or equal to the prior period end date, then the 'Prior Period Accruals' Accounting Period is used.&nbsp; If not, then the normal Accounting Period is used.</P>
 <P>This release also corrects assorted problem with editing entries. </P>
 <P>GL Entity: The GL Entity will now always default as follows: First from the Job Cost Code, next from the Location, last from the Inventory Group.</P>
 <P>Changing the WO Id will not change the Tech; this must be done manually.</P>
 <H2>9.15  Web Log Viewer</H2>
 <P>When a web log is created from TechAnywhere (as a service recommendation) the system will now prepend the tech's service recommendations (which is written to the web log’s Work Requested) with 'FromWO:xxxxxx ...' where xxxxxx is replaced by the Id of the Wo being posted.</P>
 <P><FONT style="font-weight:bold; " >Print Weblog<BR></FONT>The new Print Web Log Button works in conjunction with a new report, rwblgprnt.rpt, that prints the contents of the Web Log and its Call Script. To implement the Print Web Log functionality, the new report must be installed, a user-defined function created for it (rwblgprnt), and the function assigned to the applicable user groups. </P>
 <H2>9.16 Renew Service Contracts</H2>
 <P>This feature advances the Job Date Closed (if set) by one year. This function was also advancing the Job Date Open field by one year, which clients feel is undesirable. With this release, only the Date Closed (if initially set) is now adjusted by default. </P>
 <P>The following registry setting enables users to re-implement advancement of the Job Date Opened when Renew Service Contract is run.</P>
 <P>Id: sys-start-srnwsrvcecntrct </P>
 <P>Contents: AdvanceJobDateOpened=true</P>
 <P>If this option is specified, then the Job date opened will be advanced 1 year. The default is not to advance the job date opened.</P>
 <H2>9.17. Start Work Order Batch Closed</H2>
 <P>This function has been changed so that only Work Orders that are Cancelled or Billed will be eligible for closure. A new field, Closed Date, has been added to the Range screen to enable you to specify a default Date Closed for the Work Order if all the Date Scheduled fields on the Work Order’s Technician tab are blank. In addition, an entry to the Work Order’s Change Log will now be made when the Work Order is closed. </P>
 <H2>9.18  Start Purge Scheduled Events</H2>
 <P>By default, this function has been altered so that it now operates as follows: </P>
 <P>1. Determine the Purge Thru date by applying the DaysToSave setting (if this registry setting has DaysToSave=# not been made, 60 days will be used) to the current system date. </P>
 <P>2. Purge ALL cancelled and executed events THAT ARE NOT WORK ORDER RELATED.</P>
 <P>3. For Work Order Related Events: only purge those Scheduled Events belonging to Work Orders whose WO Escalation Status is set to Cancelled or Billed AND whose Date Closed makes it eligible for the purge.</P>
 <P>4. When the purge is run, the Escalation Profile Rn will be dropped from Work Orders whose Events were purged. This is done to prevent the creation of undesirable new escalation events if someone edits a 'closed' work order. </P>
 <P>&nbsp;A registry setting is available to restore the previous behavior:</P>
 <P><FONT style="font-weight:bold; " >&nbsp;RetainAllEventsForOpenWOs=false </FONT></P>
 <P>&nbsp;This registry entry is<FONT style="font-weight:bold; " > NOT</FONT> recommended. If implemented, the following behavior will be in effect: </P>
 <P style="margin-left:36.00pt;">1. Determine the Purge Thru date by applying the DaysToSave setting to the current system date.<BR>2. Purge ALL cancelled and executed events regardless of work order status.&nbsp;<BR>3. If IncludeClosedWorkOrders is True, eliminate all remaining events for closed work orders.&nbsp; An example would be a contingent Alarm that never went 'active' and has an Event Status of OnHold.<BR>4. Clear the Escalation Profile Rn for qualifying 'closed' work orders.&nbsp; This is done to prevent the creation of additional escalation events in the event someone edits a 'closed' work order</P>
 <H2>9.19 Work Order Daily Edit</H2>
 <P>PM Invoice-type WOs will now be skipped by this function by default.&nbsp; In this release, the default Work Order Type filter has been changed to '~PreventiveMaint,PM Invoice’ so that both Preventive Maintenance and PM Invoice work orders will be excluded.</P>
 <H1>10 Quotemaster</H1>
 <H2>10.1 Quote Viewer</H2>
 <P>Insert Line disabled has been disabled in this build. </P>
 <P>This release corrects an problem overloading problem that resulted in po/wo’s not matching the quote.  <FONT style="font-weight:bold; " >However, when approving quotes the Scope tab should be selected when the Save button is clicked, and the user should allow the record to complete the save and post before selecting any other tabs. </FONT></P>
 <P style="margin-left:36.00pt;"><FONT style="font-weight:bold; " >Note:</FONT> it is highly recommended that the quantity fields on the Quote Inventory and Material child tabs be made required fields. If the software attempts to generate a PO with 0 quantities on the General tab,  no PO will be created, and the Quote will not be saved. See your support representative for details.</P>
 <P>Problem with inserting text (via overstrike key) in the Quote Scope fields has been corrected. </P>
 <P>The Job Cost Category has been made a required field in the Material, Other, Labor and Inventory tabs to prevent problems when the Approval Wizard is run. </P>
 <P>Corrects ‘receiver is not a boolean’ message when inserting line when inserting non-scope line.</P>
 <P><FONT style="font-weight:bold; " >Revised Field: Main Tab<BR></FONT>The system now prevents WO’s flagged as Credit Hold from being used as a lead work order.  Note that a user with Credit Manager permissions must edit a Work Order to remove it from the Credit Hold status.</P>
 <P>The Job Cost Category is now a required field on the Labor, Inventory, Material and Other tabs.</P>
 <P><FONT style="font-weight:bold; " >Vendor Approval Form</FONT></P>
 <P>The leading zeroes (for quantities and dollars) have been removed from the Vendor Approval Form to provide a more professional document for the Vendor. </P>
 <P><FONT style="font-weight:bold; " >Revenue Adjustment Management fees now supported</FONT></P>
 <P>In previous versions, Quote Master only processed discounts specified the lead Work Order’s Revenue Adjustment table. Any Management Fees specified in the Revenue Adjustment table are now also processed when. </P>
 <P><FONT style="font-weight:bold; " >Equipment Filtering by Service Category</FONT></P>
 <P>Corrects filtering of Equipment on Scope tab so that if a Service Category is not set in the Work Order / Quote Header, all active Site Equipment will appear when you double-click the Equipment Id. </P>
 <P><FONT style="font-weight:bold; " >Subcontractor Tab</FONT></P>
 <P>If the Equipment specified on a Scope line references to a Service Provider Rate Schedule, then any Other Rate Id's specified on the Sub tab should default the Unit Cost values from the Equipment's Service Provider Rate Schedule table instead of the one referenced in the Vendor record. This corrects a problem where the system only referenced the Service Provider Rate Schedule in the Vendor (Sub) record entered on the Sub tab line.</P>
 <H2>10.2 Quotemaster Wizard</H2>
 <P>Overrides to the default Job Cost Code and Billing Items are now correctly written to the WO and PO’s generated. If duplicate lines are entered for 2 options, they are both written to the same cost code / billing item (the first selected in the Wizard screen) to enable the consolidation of duplicate lines on PO’s. </P>
 <P>Corrects sporadic problem with Job Cost Category not being written to WO Labor lines. </P>
 <P>The Technician may now be set or changed on the Verify Technician Page. </P>
 <P>This release also corrects a problem where the Tech Id was included in some Labor lines written from Quote Master to the WO. Since the WO Labor line is only an estimate, a technician should never be specified. </P>
 <P>Corrects sporadic problem with quantities being written incorrectly to the PO and WO.  <FONT style="font-weight:bold; font-style:italic; " >Users are advised to save quotes as open or accepted before approving and resaving them. </FONT></P>
 <P>This release also corrects an error that appeared when selecting ‘None of the Above’.  This option now functions as follows:  </P>
 <P style="margin-left:36.00pt;"><FONT style="font-weight:bold; " >None of the Above:</FONT> If you select this option, the Wizard marks the selected scopes Approved, but does not export any of the detail from your quote to a work order, purchase orders, or job history. A user might wish to use this option to produce a quote, but manually enter the invoicing information to a work order. Once an option has been approved, its status cannot be changed.</P>
 <H1>11&nbsp;Manufacturing</H1>
 <H2>11.0 Client Order and Shop Order Processing</H2>
 <P>These functions and viewers now handle inventory allocated to jobs correctly so that it will not appear as available. </P>
 <H2>11.1  COP Invoice</H2>
 <P>This enhancement adds the auto-saving by section functionality to COP Invoices.&nbsp; See section 2.6 of these release notes for details.  </P>
 <P>When a registry entry is present to archive COP Invoices, a document record was successfully created and pointed at the Client Order, Client Site and Client.

 <P>The Shop Order Detail is now displayed on the Bill of Material tab.</P>
 <P>Enhanced validation of Inventory Item Id on BOM tab improved to prevent user from saving Shop Order with the Inventory Item blanked out. </P>

 <H2>12.1 Field Label Remapping Support</H2>
 <P>SAM Pro’s Field Label Remapping functionality has been extended to CRMAnywhere and CSRAnywhere.  This allows Canadian users to, for example, change &quot;State&quot; and &quot;Zip Code&quot; to &quot;Prov&quot; and &quot;Postal Code&quot;.  Please refer to Help for details on Field Label Remapping.</P>
 <H3>12.1.1 Password Reminder Page</H3>
 <P class="Reference_Line" style="margin-bottom:0.00pt;">CRMAnywhere / CSRAnywhere have been enhanced to e-mail web users a temporary password if they forget theirs.  </P>
 <P>A link entitled &quot;Forgot your password?&quot; has been added to the CRMAnywhere / CSRAnywhere login screen. When your users click this link, they will be taken to the Password Reminder page. This page will enable your users to enter either their Web User Id or Email Address (from their Web User record). When they click the Send button, SAM Pro will auto-generate a new password and send it to them. Note that this functionality is not supported if the CRMAnywhere or CSRAnywhere login is via a Technician (rather than a Web User) record.</P>
 <P><FONT style="font-family:'Tahoma'; color:black; " >A new banner, password_reminder.gif, will be required for this page.

 <H3>12.2.1 Open Work Orders Page</H3>
 <P>Instead of grouping the Open Requests by Site, the Site information has been incorporated into the columns.  Sort by Column functionality (either ascending or descending) has been added for all columns.</P>
 <P>In previous releases, open work orders were excluded if the date created is more then &quot;DaysHistoryLimit&quot; set in the web-settings registry. In this release, this constraint is dropped by default: there will not be any age control on open work orders. To restore the original behavior, an option to the web-settings registry entry is available as detailed in section 2.12 of these release notes.</P>
 <H3>12.2.2 Completed Work Orders Page</H3>

 <H2>12.3 User Logon Table now includes CRMAnywhere and CSRAnywhere Users</H2>
 <P>When a CRMAnywhere / CSRAnywhere user logs on, an entry will now be added to the User Logon Table. This table may then be queried for reporting purposes such as marketing analyses of which customers are using web access and so on.  Information in this table includes: user id, date and time of logon, date and time of logoff, user access type, virtual machine and user name, logon status, and sampro version number. </P>
 <H2>12.4 CRMAnywhere Service History Report Enhancement</H2>

 <H1>13.0  TechAnywhere RTD (Blackberry)</H1>
 <H1>13.1 Overview</H1>
 <H2>Introduction</H2>
 <P>This functionality enables your firm to send work order information from SAM Pro to your technicians in the field on RTD’s (Remote Technician Devices) such as Blackberries. This document provides background information on how information is passed between SAM Pro and the RTD, setup information, and technical details on managed list operations. </P>
 <P>The registry entry needed to manage this functionality is described in <A href="registry_entry_rtd_remote_tech_device.htm">Registry Entry RTD Remote Tech Device</A> .</P>
 <P>PM Tasks and Service Metrics processing added. </P>
 <H2>Mirifex Overview</H2>
 <P>Mirifex will be providing</P>
 <P style="margin-left:18.00pt;">- The client application running on the Tech Device.</P>
 <P style="margin-left:18.00pt;">- A transfer mechanism which will be used to transfer data between Sampro and the Tech device.</P>
 <P>Shared folders will be used for the data transfer mechanism. Mirifex software will pick up outbound (from Sampro’s perspective) files from shared folders and transfer them to the Tech Device. Mirifex software will also pick up inbound files sent by the Tech Device and deposit them in shared folders.</P>
 <P>All files transferred in both directions will be properly formatted XML files. The contents and format of these files will conform to Data-Basics specifications.</P>
 <H2>Work Order Transfer and Posting Cycle</H2>
 <P style="margin-left:18.00pt;"><FONT style="font-weight:bold; " >Sampro</FONT><FONT style="font-weight:bold; " > (Publishing Of New Work Orders):<BR></FONT>Whenever a Work Order is created or changed, SAM Pro’s Escalation Manger examines the Escalation Profile associated with the Work Order. Certain Escalation Events associated with the Profile can trigger the sending of the Work Order to the Tech Device. </P>
 <P style="margin-left:18.00pt;">When one of these events is detected, the Escalation Manager will queue up a Scheduled Event whose function is to initiate the writing of the outbound XML file representing the Work Order. That Scheduled Event will identify the Work Order Id and the Id of the Work Order’s Assigned Technician.</P>
 <P style="margin-left:18.00pt;">Scheduled Event Manager periodically examines its queue and identifies Pending events whose Scheduled Date and Scheduled Time has been exceeded. When it identifies the event queued as above, it invokes a routine which XML encodes the Work Order and writes the XML encoded Work Order to the Outbound XML folder. This folder is identified in the Sampro Registry.</P>
 <P style="margin-left:18.00pt;">The shared folder must be accessible by the Mirifex server. Mirifex software watches this folder for newly added documents. When Mirifex identifies a new work order (encoded as an XML document), it will automatically transfer the XML for the work order to the Tech Device corresponding to the Assigned Technician’s Email Address. It will then transfer the document from the Outbound folder to an Archive folder.</P>
 <P style="margin-left:18.00pt;"><FONT style="font-weight:bold; " >Tech Device (Receiving New Work Orders):</FONT><BR>When the Tech Device receives a Work Order from Sampro, it places it in a folder which serves as an ‘open work order repository’.</P>
 <P style="margin-left:18.00pt;"><FONT style="font-weight:bold; " >Tech Device (Updating of Work Information by Technician)<BR></FONT>The Mirifex Remote Tech application on the Tech Device is used by the technician to retrieve information about the work order, to make ‘Technician Entries’ such as labor and work completed against the work order, and to change the status of the work order.</P>
 <P style="margin-left:18.00pt;"><FONT style="font-weight:bold; " >Tech Device (Publishing of Work Orders Changes):<BR></FONT>When the technician changes the status of a Work Order on the Tech Device, the Tech Device application will XML encode the Work Order and cause the XML to be forwarded to Sampro. A list of valid Status Codes and their associated status categories will be supplied to the Tech Device as a ‘Managed List’ (Managed Lists are explained below).</P>
 <P style="margin-left:18.00pt;"><FONT style="font-weight:bold; " >Sampro</FONT><FONT style="font-weight:bold; " > (Receiving Of Work Order Changes):<BR></FONT>A Sampro scheduled event periodically executes the Sampro function ‘Srtddcmntpst’ (Start Remote Tech Device Document Post). Srtddcmntpst polls the appropriate folder for XML files incoming from Tech Devices. This folder is identified in the sys-rtd Sampro registry.</P>
 <P style="margin-left:18.00pt;">When Sampro finds a Work Order XML document in the Inbound Document Source Folder, it attempts to post that document to the corresponding Work Order. The Sampro Class ‘WOFromRTDPost’ implements the posting logic.</P>
 <P style="margin-left:18.00pt;">There are two types of posting mechanisms. The posting mechanism is determined by the status category corresponding to the WorkOrderStatus value founding the XML.</P>
 <P style="margin-left:36.00pt;">If the status category is ‘open’, then the document is treated as a ‘status change’ document. The new status information is extracted from the XML and the Work Order is updated accordingly. This involves searching the Work Order’s Tech tab for the line referencing the Assigned Technician; emulating the entry of the appropriate information on the line, and emulating the pressing of the Save key.</P>
 <P style="margin-left:36.00pt;">If the status category is other than ‘open’, then the document is treated as a ‘completion’ document. The Work Order’s status updated as above. In addition, the Work Order is updated with information from the XML’s TechEntries tag. Note that where this process requires adding entries to any of the Work Order’s child tabs, the new entries will be appended to any entries already in place.</P>
 <P style="margin-left:18.00pt;">Finally, the file containing the XML is either deleted or is moved to an archive folder as directed by the Sampro ‘sys-rtd’ registry ‘disposition’ entries.</P>
 <P style="margin-left:18.00pt;"><FONT style="font-weight:bold; " >Sampro</FONT><FONT style="font-weight:bold; " > (Managed List Updating)<BR></FONT>The Mirifex application running on the RTD requires a number of ‘managed lists’. These are normally used to populate pull down lists displayed on the application’s forms. These lists are usually derived from Sampro tables. The contents of these lists may change from time to time. When a list changes, the new list must be uploaded to the tech devices. The shared folder used to hold the current set of managed lists is defined within the Sampro registry.</P>
 <P style="margin-left:18.00pt;">The Sampro class RTDManagedListWriter is used to generate XML for all the managed lists. It then compares the generated XML against that maintained in the OutboundManagedListFolder. If the generated entry is not already in the folder, or if it differs from the entry already in the folder, the newly generated XML document is written to the OutboundManagedListFolder.</P>
 <P style="margin-left:18.00pt;">The OutboundManagedListFolder must be visible to the Mirifex server software. The server software will recognize when a new document is created in the folder or an existing document is replaced, and cause the document is uploaded to all Tech Devices.</P>
 <P style="margin-left:18.00pt;">A Sampro scheduled event, periodically executes the Sampro function ‘srtdexprtmngdlsts’ which uses RTDManagerListWriter to update the OutboundManagedListFolder as necessary.</P>
 <P style="margin-left:18.00pt;"><FONT style="font-weight:bold; " >Sampro</FONT><FONT style="font-weight:bold; " > (Housekeeping)<BR></FONT>If generated and received XML files are not deleted immediately after use, some mechanism must be provided to periodically delete files which are beyond a certain age. No such application currently exists and should be handled manually.</P>
 <P style="margin-left:18.00pt;"><FONT style="font-weight:bold; " >Sampro</FONT><FONT style="font-weight:bold; " > (Logging)<BR></FONT>A logging mechanism can be enabled by appropriate entries in the ‘sys-rtd’ registry entry. A log entry is be generated whenever Sampro generates an XML file for publishing. A log entry is be generated whenever an XML file is retrieved from a Tech Device and posted. Any error conditions encountered in either of these operations will appear in the log.</P>
 <P style="margin-left:18.00pt;"><FONT style="font-weight:bold; " >Sampro (Error Reporting)<BR></FONT>Any errors encountered by Sampro in the generating or posting of XML will be reported in the log. </P>
 <H3>Other Functions</H3>
 <P><FONT style="font-weight:bold; " >Daily Work Order Export Function<BR></FONT>This function may be used to export XML for all Work Orders whose Technician tabs meet certain criteria. These criteria are defined in the sys-rtd Sampro registry entry. In particular, the administrator may specify an effective date (‘today’ or ‘tomorrow’) and a list of Log Type Ids When this function is run, Technician Tab lines meeting the criteria trigger the generation of the corresponding outbound XML files. See <A href="start_rtd_daily_work_order_export.htm">Start RTD Daily Work Order Export</A>  for additional information. </P>
 <P>This function would normally be automatically run on a daily basis via Scheduled Event Manager entries. </P>
 <P><FONT style="font-weight:bold; " >Dispatch Board - RTD Export Button</FONT><FONT style="font-weight:bold; " >: </FONT>This new button is used in conjunction with the new Remote Tech Device - TechAnywhere/Blackberry functionality.  When pressed, this button will export an RTD XML file for the currently selected dispatch line. Note that this button is only enabled if the selected work order line is eligible for export (e.g., it is of the correct status, and is assigned to Technician with the correct web access). </P>
 <H2>Setup Steps for SAM Pro</H2>

 <H1>13.2 Start RTD Daily Work Order Export</H1>
 <H2>Purpose: </H2>
 <P>This function is designed to periodically export Work Orders to the Blackberry for Remote Tech Device users. <BR>This function can be initiated periodically by the Scheduled Event Manager. </P>
 <P>This function will create XML files in the FMMS Outbound Folder based on criteria stored in the sys-rtd registry entry.</P>
 <H2>Registry Entry:</H2>
 <P style="margin-top:5.00pt;margin-bottom:5.00pt;">The operation of this function will be controlled by parameters stored in the <A href="registry_entry_rtd_remote_tech_device.htm">Registry Entry RTD Remote Tech Device</A> .</P>
 <H2>Usage: </H2>
 <P>This function will operate as follows (assuming that the applicable registry entry has been set):</P>
 <P>1. Scan the all lines of the Technicians tab of all work orders. </P>
 <P>2. Disregard all lines for which any of the following are true:</P>
 <P style="margin-left:36.00pt;">The Scheduled Date does not match the DailyExportDate criteria. For the purpose of this test , ‘today’  and ‘tomorrow’ will be based the clock date in effect at the time the function is run.</P>
 <P style="margin-left:36.00pt;">The Log Type Id does not match one of the values specified by the DailyExportStatusCodes criteria.</P>
 <P style="margin-left:36.00pt;">The Technician is not Active.</P>
 <P style="margin-left:36.00pt;">The Technician does not have a Remote Device Type of ‘CE’.</P>
 <P>3. For all technician lines not disregarded in the preceding step, the function will export an XML file for the corresponding work order and technician to the outbound folder for transfer to the Blackberry by Mirifex.</P>

 <H2>14.0 TechAnywhere – Tablet / PC</H2>
 <P>The TechAnywhere client now overrides the status changes on a work order if the work order was dispatched to the technician (and the dispatcher hasn't changed the status to cancelled). For example a TechAnywhere tech receives a work order and changes the status to onsite. Now, the dispatcher accidentally changes the status to travel. At this point, SAM Pro and TechAnywhere software are out of sync and the posting from TechAnywhere would fail. </P>
 <P>With this enhancement, when the tech goes to set the work order to complete (or another status) the technician's status now overrides the status that the dispatcher set in SAM Pro and re-synchronizes the software. Note that the only case where the dispatcher’s status overrides the technician’s is for ‘cancelled.’ </P>
