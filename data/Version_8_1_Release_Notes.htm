<h1>Version 8.1 Release Notes – 8.1.517.018</h1>
<p>If you were already on Version 8.1, click <a href="Version_8_1_Release_Notes.htm#Version_8.1_Recent_Updates">8.1 Recent Updates</a> for a brief synopsis of the most recent changes to this version (see page 34 of the printed notes or page 43 in the Adobe viewer). If you have just upgraded to Version 8.1, be sure to review all of the release notes.</p>
<h1>1 System</h1>
<h2>1.1 Intercompany Processing</h2>
<h3>1.1.1 Overview</h3>
<p>This enhancement supports Intercompany Processing at the GL level via automated ‘Due To’ and ‘Due From’ transactions any time costs or revenue is incurred/earned by one company on behalf of another company. Anytime the system sees a difference between the company that a balance sheet G/L Entity belongs to and the company that the Income Statement G/L Entity belongs to, the automated 'Due To' and 'Due From' transactions will be made.</p>
<p>For example, if monies are received in the AR Cash Receipts by Company A for work billed by Company B, the system would make the usual debit to the AR account and credit to the bank account. In addition, the Due From account in Company A would be debited, and the Due To account in Company B would be credited: this processing keeps the balance sheet accounts in balance.</p>
<p>Alternately if monies are received in the AR Cash Receipts by Company A for work billed by Company A, the system would only make the usual debit to the AR account and credit to the bank account: the automated intercompany transactions would not be needed.</p>
<p>Currently, Intercompany Processing does NOT support one company’s ‘profiting’ from work performed for another company. All restitutions are made via the Bank Transfer function.</p>
<h3>1.1.2 Setup</h3>
<p>Ideally, Intercompany Processing would be implemented when first starting to use SAMPro. If there is any possibility of a new company being acquired in the future, new ‘one company’ firms can be set up for Intercompany Processing; if and when a new company is acquired, it can be more easily integrated into the database.</p>
<p>Firms currently running SAMPro without Intercompany Processing should consult their support representative if they are thinking about implementing this functionality: a significant amount of work will be required to convert an existing system.</p>
<p>The existing GL Entity and Security records and the new Company record are at the heart of Intercompany Processing.</p>
<p><font style="font-weight: bold;">GL Entity:</font> Each GL Entity must specify a specific Company.&#160;&#160;In addition to the GL Entities designated for the various profit centers within a company, a ‘balance sheet’ Entity will be created for use with Intercompany postings.</p>
<p><font style="font-weight: bold;">GL Account:</font> A ‘Due To’ asset account and a ‘Due From’ Liability account should be created for each company. A good technique for the Due to and Due From GL accounts is to create a root account with the company extension (i.e. DUE TO 1200-A for company A and 1200-B for company B …)</p>
<p><font style="font-weight: bold;">Security:</font> A Security record must be created for each Company</p>
<p><font style="font-weight: bold;">Company:</font> The Company record defines the Security Id, GL Entity (for balance sheet transactions), and ‘Due To’ and ‘Due’ From GL Accounts.</p>
<h3>1.1.3 New Record: Company</h3>
<p><font style="font-weight: bold;">Purpose:</font></p>
<p>This record is required for Intercompany Processing. The Company record defines the Security Id, GL Entity (for balance sheet transactions), and ‘Due To’ and ‘Due’ From GL Accounts.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">&#160;</p>
<p><font style="font-weight: bold;">I</font><font style="font-weight: bold;">mportant Fields: Lower Section</font></p>
<p><font style="font-weight: bold;">Registry Tab:</font></p>
<p style="margin-left: 36.00pt;"><font style="font-weight: bold;">Key:</font> <font style="font-weight: bold;">Value:</font> <font style="font-weight: bold;">Description</font>:</p>
<p style="margin-left: 36.00pt;">These fields are reserved for future use.</p>
<p><font style="font-weight: bold;">States Tab:</font></p>
<p style="margin-left: 36.00pt;"><font style="font-weight: bold;">ST:</font></p>
<p style="margin-left: 36.00pt;">This tab should be used to define the State/States associated with this Company.</p>
<p style="margin-left: 36.00pt;"><font style="font-weight: bold;">State EIN:</font></p>
<p style="margin-left: 36.00pt;">This field is reserved for future use with reporting.</p>
<p><font style="font-weight: bold;">Entities Tab:</font></p>
<p>This tab displays the Balance Sheet and Profit Center Entities that point at this Company record.</p>
<p class="Support" style="margin-left: 36.00pt;">&#160;</p>
<h3>1.1.4 Records/Functions Changed to Support Company Processing</h3>
<p><font style="font-weight: bold;">GL Entity:</font></p>
<p style="margin-left: 36.00pt;">In addition to the GL Entities defined for profit centers, if Intercompany Processing is implemented, a GL Entity should be defined for use in Due To’Due From transactions. This type of Entity will be reference on the Company record’s GL Tab in the Balance Sheet Default GL Entity field.</p>
<p style="margin-left: 36.00pt;"><font style="font-weight: bold;">New Field: Company Id</font><br />
This field must be completed if Intercompany Processing is implemented (the sys-ffv-global-settings registry’s IntercompanyEnabled option is set to true).</p>
<p><font style="font-weight: bold;">GL Account:</font></p>
<p style="margin-left: 36.00pt;">If Intercompany Processing is implemented a ‘Due To’ Asset account and a ‘Due From’ Liability account should be created for each Company record. A good technique for the Due to and Due From GL accounts is to create a root account with the company extension (i.e. DUE TO 1200-A for company A and 1200-B for company B …).</p>
<p><font style="font-weight: bold;">AP Journal Main Tab:</font></p>
<p style="margin-left: 36.00pt;"><font style="font-weight: bold;">Changed Field: GL Entity:<br /></font>If Intercompany Processing is implemented and if this Entity does not match the GL Entities referenced in the child tabs, the appropriate Intercompany postings to GL History will be made when this transaction is saved.</p>
<p><font style="font-weight: bold;">AR Cash Receipts</font> <font style="font-weight: bold;">Main Tab</font><font style="font-weight: bold;">:</font></p>
<p style="margin-left: 36.00pt;"><font style="font-weight: bold;">Changed Field: GL Entity:</font><br />
If Intercompany Processing is implemented (the sys-ffv-global-settings registry’s IntercompanyEnabled option is set to true) and if this Entity does not match the GL Entities referenced in the child tabs, the appropriate Intercompany postings to GL History will be made when this transaction is saved.</p>
<p><font style="font-weight: bold;">Job Record</font><font style="font-weight: bold;">:</font></p>
<p style="margin-left: 36.00pt;"><font style="font-weight: bold;">Changed Field: Job GL Entity Id<br /></font>When Intercompany Processing is enabled, the GL Entities specified in the Job record MUST reference the same Company as the GL Entities specified in its Cost Codes. Validation will not allow the GL Entity to be changed to one referencing a different Company.</p>
<p><font style="font-weight: bold;">Job Cost Code Record:</font></p>
<p style="margin-left: 36.00pt;"><font style="font-weight: bold;">Changed Field: GL Entity Id<br /></font>When Intercompany Processing is enabled, the GL Entities specified in the Job record MUST reference the same Company as the GL Entities specified in its Cost Codes. Validation will not allow the GL Entity to be changed to one referencing a different Company.</p>
<p><font style="font-weight: bold;">Location:</font> complete the GL Entity field added to the Status tab.</p>
<p><font style="font-weight: bold;">Purchase Order Record:</font></p>
<p style="margin-left: 36.00pt;"><font style="font-weight: bold;">Status Tab -</font> <font style="font-weight: bold;">New Field: GL Entity Id<br /></font>This field defaults from the Location record. It is required if Intercompany Processing is enabled.</p>
<p><font style="font-weight: bold;">New Call</font> <font style="font-weight: bold;">and Create PM Work Orders</font><font style="font-weight: bold;">:</font></p>
<p style="margin-left: 36.00pt;">When Intercompany Processing is enabled, the Job GL Entity specified in the selected Job will determine the Work Order’s Company/Security.</p>
<p><font style="font-weight: bold;">Compute PR:</font></p>
<p style="margin-left: 36.00pt;">When Intercompany Processing is enabled, the GL Entity specified in the Employee record provided the override for the Company/Security of the post.</p>
<p><font style="font-weight: bold;">Bank Transfer Journal:</font></p>
<p style="margin-left: 36.00pt;">When Intercompany Processing is enabled, the Bank Entity is required: it decides which Company/Service the transfer belongs to. The Transfer From Entity is also required for Intercompany Processing.</p>
<p><font style="font-weight: bold;">Bank</font> <font style="font-weight: bold;">Deposit</font> <font style="font-weight: bold;">Journal:</font></p>
<p style="margin-left: 36.00pt;">When Intercompany Processing is enabled, the Bank and Sweep Entities are both required. The Bank Entity controls what Company/Security the deposit is applied to. The Sweep Entity defines the Company/Security the deposit is from. If the Bank and Sweep Entities are different, an automatic Intercompany Processing GL transaction will be generated.</p>
<p><font style="font-weight: bold;">Record Billing Adjustments/ Progress Billing:</font></p>
<p style="margin-left: 36.00pt;">When intercompany processing is enabled, the Company/Security is set for the AR Sales Journal and resulting history records when Progress Invoices are posted.</p>
<p style="margin-left: 36.00pt;">The A/R Control GL Entity is now displayed on the Progress Billing Post Report. Although the GL Entities for the Sale Tax entries do not appear on this report, they are written to history correctly.</p>
<p><font style="font-weight: bold;">Job Cost EOM Processing:</font></p>
<p style="margin-left: 36.00pt;">When intercompany processing is enabled, the Company/Security is set in General Ledger History when this function is run.</p>
<p><font style="font-weight: bold;">Voiding Checks:</font> The Company/Security is correctly set in history when running this function.</p>
<p style="margin-left: 36.00pt;">&#160;</p>
<h3>1.1.5 History Tables Changed to Support Intercompany Processing</h3>
<p>An Intercompany? field has been added to the following History tables: it will be checked if the transaction records an intercompany transaction: AP GL History (apglhstry_intrcmpny), AR GL History (arglhstry_intrcmpny) and GL History (glhstry_intrcmpny).</p>
<p>The Company/Security field (cmpny_sscrty_rn) has been added to: AP History, AP GL History, AR History, AR GL History, GL History, IM History, JC History, PR History, Sales Commission History, Tax History.</p>
<p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">&#160;</p>
<h3>1.1.6 Intercompany Reporting</h3>
<p>To support Intercompany Processing, the bitmap path is now saved in the dbr file itself, so that the registry is not required to display the desired bitmap when the report is redisplayed. If the saved report is from an earlier release where the bitmap path was not saved, the applicable registry entry will be used. This functionality has been expanded to the code SAMPro uses to generate the XML file used by the xmltopdf.jar file so that .PDF’s are also generated correctly.</p>
<p>Functionality has been added to all reporting functions to support Company-based security.</p>
<p><font style="font-weight: bold;">Report Range Viewer: New Select Company Pane</font></p>
<p>The new Select Company pane (located in the upper part of the screen between the Preview/Print/Schedule pane and the Report Ranges pane) will list the Company records defined in your database. To run the report the report for a specific company, click on a line to select it. To run the report for all Companies, do NOT select a Company: all will be shown.</p>
<p>If the report is run for all companies, the company name on the report will default from the companyname registry entry. If the report is run for a selected company, the company name on the report will default from the Company record’s Company Name field.</p>
<p><font style="font-weight: bold;">Start Compute Service Invoice</font></p>
<p><font style="font-weight: bold;">New Field: Company Id:</font><font style="font-weight: bold;"><br /></font>If Intercompany Processing is enabled, this field is required to run Service Invoices. The Service Invoices generated will use the bitmaps specified by the sys-report-serviceinvoice-securityid registry unless overridden by a user-specific registry.</p>
<h2>1.2 Book Viewer</h2>
<h3>1.2.1 Registry To Display Files as they Generate (restores previous behavior)</h3>
<p>In previous releases, when .PDF files were created from the Book viewer, they were immediate displayed, along with a document log workspace. Since this could generate an alarming number of windows, the default is to NOT display the .PDF or Workspace files.</p>
<p>If you would prefer that the .PDF files be displayed as they are generated, the following registry is required.</p>
<p><font style="font-weight: bold;">Id:</font> sys-viewer-vbk</p>
<p><font style="font-weight: bold;">Setting Key:</font> ShowMakePDFInfo Setting Value: true&#160;&#160;(default is false)</p>
<h3>1.2.2 Make PDF Enhancements</h3>
<p>If the Book is by Invoice, MakePDF now names chapters 'Inv#',chapter,'[',BookId,']'.pdf<br />
where chapter is an invoice number.</p>
<p>If the Book is by Site, MakePDF now names chapters 'Site',chapter,'[',BookId,']'.pdf<br />
where chapter is a Site Id.</p>
<p>A progress Meter has been added to MakePDF to see how it is progressing; this will only appear if more than one PDF file is being generated.</p>
<p>A confirmation has been added if MakePDF is pressed after MakePDF has been run; the message ‘Directory holding Chapters for this Book already exists. Are you sure you want to run this function again?’</p>
<p>MakePDF will put chapters in the book directory from registry as follows:</p>
<p style="margin-left: 36.00pt;">PDFDirectory from registry sys-viewer-vbk or<br />
Directory from dbreportfiles or<br />
else the default is the Sampro BaseDirectory.</p>
<h3>1.2.3 Select Documents Tab</h3>
<p><font style="font-weight: bold;">New Field: Omit Booked Invoices<br /></font>When this field is flagged, only those documents related to invoices that have not yet been included in a Book document will be included list when the Autopopulate button is clicked.</p>
<h3>1.2.4 Emailing from the Book Viewer</h3>
<p>The Outlook mail client may have issues with pathing on multiple attachments when it is automatically launched with attachments. To avoid this problem, when the Email button is clicked, the SAMPro mailer is now launched if multiple attachments exist, even if UseOutlook is set to True in the sys-email registry. If only a single attachment exists, the Outlook email form will be used if UseOutlook is set to true.</p>
<h2>1.3 Reporting</h2>
<h3>1.3.1 Redisplaying Saved Reports</h3>
<p>When a report is archived, the bitmap path is now saved in the dbr file itself, so that the registry is not required to display the desired bitmap when the report is redisplayed. If the saved report is from an earlier release where the bitmap path was not saved, the applicable registry entry will be used. This functionality has been expanded to the code SAMPro uses to generate the XML file used by the xmltopdf.jar file so that .PDF’s are also generated correctly.</p>
<h3>1.3.2 Document Management – PDF and DBR Reports</h3>
<p>Although SAMPro supports saving/archiving Invoices as PDFs there is a downside.&#160;&#160;Specifically, viewing saved PDF documents is not done 'within' SAMPro; this means that SAMPro’s Email Report option is not available from the PDF document reader.</p>
<p>The registry setting described below allows for the DBR and the PDF versions of saved report to co-exist.&#160;&#160;Viewing the saved document from within SAMPro uses the DBR version.&#160;&#160;Viewing from the DBAnalytics framework uses the PDF version.&#160;&#160;This feature eliminates the need to have DBRs converted to PDFs before emailing to DBAnalyics and FMAnywhere users.&#160;&#160;Instead, the PDF can be viewed instantly from within the browser.</p>
<p>To use this new feature you must add the following registry entry:<br />
Id: sys-ffv-global-settings</p>
<p>Setting Key: UseConvertedDBRs &#160;Setting Value: true<br />
<br />
When implemented, the system converts DBR documents to archived pdf documents and saves original archive DBR file in the ConvertedDBRs subfolder, within the appropriate Month/Year directory.</p>
<h3>1.3.3 Converting Large Reports to PDF</h3>
<p>This release addresses the problem of running very large reports and then saving them to PDF after they had previewed on the screen. In previous versions, this could fail when Smalltalk ran out of memory.&#160;&#160;In this release, the XML generation has been changed from running in memory to running in WriteStream. A temporary file will be generated by Writestream; it will be</p>
<p style="margin-left: 36.00pt;">Saved in the basedir/username directory.</p>
<p style="margin-left: 36.00pt;">The temp filename includes the time (tempXML_HHMMSS) in the name.</p>
<p style="margin-left: 36.00pt;">The temp file is removed at the end of the process.</p>
<p>In addition, a registry entry has been added to support increased memory for the Java run time: this setting is only necessary for someone attempting to convert a very large report into a PDF.&#160;&#160;When the new setting is present, XMLtoPDF is instructed to allocate more memory for the Java run time so that it can process the larger XML files without running out of memory.</p>
<p style="margin-left: 36.00pt;">Registry Id: sys-ffv-global-settings<br />
Setting Key: vmflagsxmltopdf &#160;Setting Value: -Xms800m -Xmx800m</p>
<p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">&#160;</p>
<h2>1.4 Notes</h2>
<p>This release corrects spurious "Change Record?" and "You cannot change the record" messages when using the Next/Previous buttons to scroll through regular Notes records.</p>
<p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">&#160;</p>
<h2>1.5 Expand Smalltalk Memory to 500 MB</h2>
<p>SAMPro’s Smalltalk virtual memory has been expanded from 250MB to 500MB to better accommodate extremely long reports and the unfiltered display of history viewers.</p>
<p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">&#160;</p>
<h2>1.6 New XmlToPdf.jar File</h2>
<p>The XmlToPdf.jar file was updated as of 06/11/2013 to better support scheduled report emailing, and emailing SAMPro viewer lists. It also supports emailing from SAMPro with Java v7.21 and above. A copy of the older file from 11/08/2011 (renamed as XmlToPdf[OLD].jar is also included with the image in case it is needed.</p>
<p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">&#160;</p>
<h2>1.7 WebHelp</h2>
<p>Some users are experiencing problems with WebHelp’s Index under Internet Explorer 10: clicking an Index entry with multiple topics (e.g., check) does not display the dropdown list of topics. Correct this problem by installing Firefox or set Internet Explorer 10 to compatibility mode via the menu’s Tools&gt;Compatibility View Settings. To do so:</p>
<p style="margin-left: 36.00pt;">1. Access Help in Internet Explorer</p>
<p style="margin-left: 36.00pt;">2. From the browser’s menu select Tools &gt;Compatibility View Settings</p>
<p style="margin-left: 36.00pt;">3. If you are accessing SAMPro from across your company’s network, the ‘Display intranet sites in Compatibility View’ must be checked.</p>
<p style="margin-left: 36.00pt;">If you are running SAMPro locally on your computer, the ‘Display all websites in Compatibility View’ must be checked.</p>
<p style="margin-left: 36.00pt;">4. Click the Close button on the Compatibility View Settings window.</p>
<p style="margin-left: 36.00pt;">5. Close the browser and launch WebHelp from SAMPro. If your Index entries are still not working properly and only the ‘Display intranet sites in Compatibility View’ box is check, check the ‘Display all websites in Compatibility View’.</p>
<p style="margin-left: 36.00pt;">&#160;</p>
<h2>1.8 Document Viewer</h2>
<p>In this release, the Show Document button successfully checks for child subfolders when looking for the OtherFiles tab documents to display.</p>
<p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">&#160;</p>
<h2>1.9 Custom Fields</h2>
<p><font style="font-weight: bold;">Changed Field: Default Value<br /></font>This release extends the Custom Fields Default Value functionally to Check Boxes, Radio Buttons, Integer, Decimal, Date and Time fields. <font style="font-weight: bold;">These fields should only be set on record header fields.</font></p>
<p style="margin-left: 36.00pt;"><font style="font-weight: bold;">Note:</font> Certain fields are hard-coded to specific values. In these cases, the Default Value you entered will be overridden by the hard-coded value.</p>
<p>Custom Fields must be enabled in the user's User Groups and Functions (typically, only an Admin would have this privilege).</p>
<p style="margin-left: 36.00pt;"><font style="font-weight: bold; text-decoration: underline;">Set t</font><font style="font-weight: bold; text-decoration: underline;">he Default Value of a Check Box</font></p>
<p style="margin-left: 36.00pt;">1. Go to the viewer you wish to customize, and select and right-click on the check box you wish to set to checked. Click 'Yes' when the system asks if you wish to customize this field.</p>
<p style="margin-left: 36.00pt;">2.

<h1>2 Client, Site and Equipment</h1>
<h2>2.1 Registry Entries</h2>
<h3>2.1.1 Clone Site Equipment PM Schedule Button</h3>
<p>In previous releases, if you created a new Site Equipment record, and then used the Clone PM button to copy an existing inspection schedule, only those PM’s that did not have a work order assigned were copied. In this release, the default functionality is to clone ALL lines that are marked OK to Renew, regardless of whether or not a work order is assigned. In this way, when the PM Agreement is renewed via Start Renew Service Contracts or Start Create New PM Work Schedule from Old, the new equipment will have a full set of inspections.</p>
<p>The following registry may be enabled to restore the previous behavior.</p>
<p><font style="font-weight: bold;">Registry Id:</font> sys-viewer-vclntsteeqpmnt</p>
<p><font style="font-weight: bold;">Setting Key:</font> clonePMScheduleIfOkToRenew <font style="font-weight: bold;">Setting Value:</font> false (default will be true)</p>
<p style="margin-left: 36.00pt;"><font style="font-weight: bold;">Note:</font> When Cloning PM Schedules a PM schedule line assigned from a Master Contract will never be cloned.</p>
<p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">&#160;</p>
<h2>2.2 Client Site</h2>
<h3>2.2.1 Client Site PM Billing Tab</h3>
<p><font style="font-weight: bold;">Changed Field: Extended PM Invoice Description<br /></font>This field has been expanded from 400 to 3000 characters to match the WO's Work Performed field.&#160;&#160;When this field contains a value, it is written to the Invoice Description of Work Performed during the creation of PM Invoice-type work orders. Note that the older Invoice Description on the PM line is still written to the Revenue Adjustment line as in previous releases. The extended invoice description functionality is not supported by Master Contract.</p>
<h3>2.2.2 Client Site Service Tab</h3>
<p><font style="font-weight: bold;">Changed Field: Work Order Comments<br /></font>The Client Site Work Order Comments field has been expanded to a 1200 character text box. It may be updated by TechAnywhere users in the field.</p>
<h3>2.2.3 Client Site WO Other Tab</h3>
<p>When a work order is created in New Call, and an Other line is automatically generated from the Client Site's WO Other tab, the appropriate GL History entries will be generated if the Accounting Period’s WO Other to GL box is flagged.</p>
<p>To determine the correct Accounting Period, the system will look at the date to use on the WO Other line (either the date scheduled, or today's date if there is no scheduled date). If the date is with the default Accounting Period, it will use that. If the date is NOT within the default Accounting Period, it will find the appropriate active Accounting Period and use that.</p>
<p>The Cause Code and Resolution Codes (from the Work Order Equipment lines) have been added as columns.</p>
<h2>2.3 Client Site Equipment</h2>
<h3>2.3.1 New Tab: Open WOs</h3>
<p>This new tab lists all work orders created for this Site that have a Work Order Status Category of Open. One line will be displayed for each technician on the work order, with the Equipment filtered to the selected Equipment record only. The most recent work orders appear the top of the list. The Description column displays the Work Order Name. Double-click on a line to view the Work Order itself.</p>
<h3>2.3.2 New Tab: Other WOs</h3>
<p>This Query View tab lists all work orders created for this Site that have a Work Order Status Category that is not set to Open (e.g., Completed, Billed, Ok to Invoice, etc.). One line will be displayed for each technician on the work order, with the Equipment filtered to the selected Equipment record only. The most recent work orders appear at the top of the list.

<h1>3 AP</h1>
<h2>3.1 AP Related Registry</h2>
<h2>3.2 AP Related Reporting</h2>
<h3>3.2.1 Report AP Check Register</h3>
<p>The five Vendor User fields have been added as range fields to this report (RAPCHEKv72b001.rpt) dated 02/15/2013.</p>
<h3>3.2.2 AP Cash Requirements Report</h3>
<p>The Invoice # column has been expanded to 20 characters. This is a system report and does not need to be imported.</p>
<h3>3.2.3 Report Vendor Invoice</h3>
<p>The revised Report Vendor Invoice-CSV (RVNDRINVCE-CSV.rpt) dated 7/19/2013 corrects a sporadic “Unable to Insert Into Temp Table #vndrinvce1” error.</p>
<p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">&#160;</p>
<h2>3.3 AP Journal</h2>
<p>The Equipment specified on the PO’s lines is now defaulted to the AP Journal entry. In previous releases, the Equipment defaulted from the first Equipment line on the associated Work Order.</p>
<p>The system now sets the Check GL Entity correctly from the AP Journal header when posting APJ EFT and Credit/Debit Card transactions.</p>
<p>Corrects issues with intercompany reversals in previous images.</p>
<p>In previous releases, the Equipment Id could not be manually entered into AP Journal lines: it was necessary to double-click and select the line from the list. In this release, code has been added to enable the user to type in the Equipment Id following successful entry of the Work Order Id.</p>
<p>When Intercompany Processing is on, the parent security determination is based on the APJ parent GL Entity. The posting of Use Tax Liability also uses the AP parent record's security.</p>
<p>If Intercompany Processing is not enabled, the AP Journal entry and the history records it generates continue to assume the Security Id of the Purchase Order used to generate them.</p>
<h3>3.3.1 AP Journal Main Tab</h3>
<p><font style="font-weight: bold;">Changed Field: GL Entity:<br /></font>If Intercompany Processing is implemented and if this Entity does not match the GL Entities referenced in the child tabs, the appropriate Intercompany postings to GL History will be made when this transaction is saved.</p>
<h3>3.3.2 Purchase History Tab</h3>
<p>The User Id associated to the transaction line is now displayed in the last column of this tab. This will be the user who created the PO, user who did the receipt, etc.</p>
<h3>3.3.3 Manual Check</h3>
<p>The Bank Account specified in AP Journal's&#160;AP Manual check now uses the GL Entity specified in the AP Journal header when posting.<br /></p>
<h2>3.4 Vendor Viewer &#160;</h2>
<h3>3.4.1 Vendor User Fields</h3>
<p>The five Vendor User fields have been added as range fields for the following functions:</p>

<h2>3.5 Clear Checks</h2>
<p>This release corrects a “Runtime Error: illegal character in format” that occurred if the user attempted to clear a credit memo EFT or Credit Card entry what result in a negative ‘check’ amount. In this release, both positive and negative EFT's and Credit card entries will clear.</p>
<h1>4 Purchasing</h1>
<h2>4.1 Registry</h2>
<h3>4.1.1 Default PO Sales Tax Group from Job &#160;</h3>
<p>By default, the PO Tax Group defaults from the Vendor record if the Vendor record has a Tax Group. Since this does not produce the desired result in all cases, this release implements a new setting that sets the PO parent Tax Group based on the Job's Tax Group.&#160;&#160;The job can be entered directly in the PO parent or it can be determined from the WO entered directly in the PO.</p>
<p>This setting causes the PO parent Sales Tax Group to be set from the Job record.&#160;&#160;This can be either the Job entered directly in the PO parent record or it can be the Job from Work Order entered directly in the PO parent record.</p>
<p><font style="font-weight: bold;">Registry Id:</font> sys-viewer-vprchseordrlst &#160;</p>
<p><font style="font-weight: bold;">Setting Key:</font> DefaultPOTaxGroupFromJob &#160;<font style="font-weight: bold;">Setting Value:</font> true (default is false)</p>
<h3>4.1.2 Reorder Advice Registry Option to show Site Name</h3>
<p>You have the option of showing the Site Name for work orders, client orders, purchase orders and/or shop orders. The Site is derived from work order, job and/or client order as needed.</p>
<p><font style="font-weight: bold;">Id:</font> sys-report-rrordradvce</p>
<p><font style="font-weight: bold;">Setting Key:</font> ShowSiteInfo</p>
<p><font style="font-weight: bold;">Setting Value:</font> WorkOrder,ClientOrder,PurchaseOrder,ShopOrder</p>
<p>You may specify as many of the above values as needed.</p>
<h3>4.1.3 Credit PO’s must be Received in AP Journal</h3>
<p>By default, unreceived PO lines for regular PO's may not be vouchered, but credit PO lines can be vouchered even if they aren't received. A new registry option has been added to prevent unreceived credit PO lines from being vouchered. To invoke this new behavior the user must add following option:</p>
<p><font style="font-weight: bold;">Registry Id:</font> sys-viewer-vapjrnl</p>
<p><font style="font-weight: bold;">Setting Key:</font> CreditPOsMustBeReceived Setting Value: true</p>
<h3>4.1.4 Set Cost from Standard in PO’s</h3>
<p>When a PO is created, an Inventory Item's cost defaults from the Inventory Item's Vendor tab. The following registry setting overrides this behavior and instead uses the Item’s Standard Cost. If the Standard Cost is not completed, the Last Cost is used.</p>
<p><font style="font-weight: bold;">Registry Id:</font> sys-viewer-vprchseordrlst</p>
<p><font style="font-weight: bold;">Setting Key:</font> useStandardCostFirst <font style="font-weight: bold;">Setting Value:</font> true (default is false)</p>

<h2>4.2 Purchasing Reports</h2>
<h3>4.2.1 Report Vendor Invoice</h3>
<p>The Report Vendor Invoice-CSV.rpt dated 7/19/2013 corrects an “Unable to Insert Into Temp Table #vndrinvce1” error caused by the expanded Vendor Invoice Id.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">&#160;</p>
<h2>4.3 Purchase Order Viewer</h2>
<p>In previous releases, the Equipment Id could not be manually entered into PO lines: it was necessary to double-click and select the line from the list. In this release, code has been added to enable the user to type in the Equipment Id following successful entry of the Work Order Id.</p>
<p>The PO viewer now allows Inventory and Job quantities to be different when the PO parent has a Tax Group as long as the Inventory line has the same Tax Group.</p>
<h3>4.3.1 Status Tab</h3>
<p><font style="font-weight: bold;">New Field:</font> <font style="font-weight: bold;">GL Entity Id<br /></font>This field defaults from the Location record. It is required if Intercompany Processing is enabled.</p>
<h3>4.3.2 Inventory Tab</h3>
<p>In this release, the Work Order information from the PO Header is not defaulted to the Inventory Tab until a Quantity is entered, correcting a problem in Version 8.1.517.016 which occurred if you <font style="text-decoration: underline;">manually</font> entered the WO Id in the PO header.</p>
<p><font style="font-weight: bold;">Changed Fields: Job Quantity Ordered/Received<br /></font>TechAnywhere-generated Purchase Orders no longer default the Job Quantity Ordered/Received when the Quantity Ordered/Received is changed to prevent double-costing.</p>
<p><font style="font-weight: bold;">Changed Field: Inventory Id:<br /></font>The system now checks to see if a part has been superceded (the Superceded By field on the Inventory Other Tab is filled in). When a superseded part number is entered into this field, the system will alert the user that</p>
<p style="margin-left: 36.00pt;">Item A has been superceded by Item B. Use New Item?</p>
<p>It the user clicks Yes, the new part (B) will be returned to the field. If the user clicks No, part A (which has been superceded) will remain in the field.</p>
<h3>4.3.3 GLH Tab</h3>
<p>The Vendor Invoice No has been added to the Purchase Order viewer's GLH tab. This release corrects formatting of the Credit and Invoice No. columns.</p>
<h2>4.4 Start Generate POs</h2>
<h3>4.4.1 New Fields on List/Edit Screen:</h3>

When a superseded part number is entered into the inventory item id field of the Work Order Inventory lines, Work Order Required Resources lines, Purchase Order Inventory lines, COP Order Entry lines or Quote Master Inventory lines the system will alert the user that</p>
<p style="margin-left: 36.00pt;">Item A has been superceded by Item B. Use New Item?</p>
<p>It the user clicks Yes, the new part (B) will be returned to the field. If the user clicks No, part A (which has been superceded) will remain in the field.</p>
<p><font style="font-weight: bold;">Inventory Item Other Tab New Field: Superceded By:<br /></font>This field should only be completed if the current Inventory Item record you are in has been superceded by the item you specify in this field. The superseded Inventory Item will be marked “inactive” when this field is completed. Superceded parts CANNOT be flagged as Obsolete.</p>
<p>Note that a string of superseded parts can be created that will result in the latest part number being returned to the data entry screen. For example, Part A could be superseded by Part B which could be superseded by Part C. If the user were to type in Part A, Part C would be returned if he elected to use the new item.</p>

<h2>9.4 GL Account</h2>
<h3>9.4.1 Intercompany Processing</h3>
<p>If Intercompany Processing (see user release note 1.1) is implemented a ‘Due To’ Asset account and a ‘Due From’ Liability account should be created for each Company record. A good technique for the Due to and Due From GL accounts is to create a root account with the company extension (i.e. DUE TO 1200-A for company A and 1200-B for company B …).</p>

<p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">&#160;</p>
<h2>12.3 TechAnywhere Quotes</h2>
<p>See user release note 17.3 for information on Quotes generated via TechAnywhere.</p>
<h2>12.4 Quote Viewer</h2>
<p>This release corrects Tab Mismatch errors on Revenues and Quantity fields fields due to rounding. It also corrects a problem in recent images where the extended value in negative quantity detail lines was off by a penny, resulting in a Tab Mismatch error.</p>
<p>Validation has also been added to prevent the Vendor Id from being completed on negative quantity Inventory and Material lines when the Quote is saved/added.</p>
<p>The Work Code from the Quote viewer will be written to the Work Order header and Equipment line(s) when a new Work Order is generated.</p>
<p>A Work Order may now be used as the source Work Order on multiple Quotes.</p>
<h3>12.4.1 Quote List View</h3>
<p>The Estimator Id has been added to the QuoteByIdByWorkorder order of the Quote List View.</p>
<p>A new List View order has been added, QuoteByIdByWorkorderByScope. This view displays an individual line for each Scope Option and Status in the Quote.</p>
<h3>12.4.2 Quote Filter View</h3>
<p>A new Range, Estimator Id, has been added to the Quote Filter screen.</p>
<h3>12.4.3 Quote Main Tab:</h3>
<p><font style="font-weight: bold;">Changed Button: Approve All<br /></font>In previous releases, the Approve All button only worked on Open and Accepted Options. In this release, it also sets Printed options to Approved.</p>
<p><font style="font-weight: bold;">Changed Field -</font> <font style="font-weight: bold;">Estimator Id:<br /></font>The Estimator Id now defaults from the Quote's Job anytime the Job is changed/added.&#160;&#160;This includes both direct edits of the Quote's Job Id as well as any indirect methods for changing the Job Id ... for example, changing the Work Order Id.<br /></p>
<h3>12.4.4 Quote Inventory Tab</h3>
<p><font style="font-weight: bold;">Changed Field: Inventory Id:<br /></font>The system now checks to see if a part has been superceded (the Superceded By field on the Inventory Other Tab is filled in). When a superseded part number is entered into this field, the system will alert the user that</p>
<p style="margin-left: 36.00pt;">Item A has been superceded by Item B. Use New Item?</p>
<p>It the user clicks Yes, the new part (B) will be returned to the field. If the user clicks No, part A (which has been superceded) will remain in the field.</p>
<h3>12.4.5 Quote Scope Tab</h3>
<p><img src="image/ImportDiagnostic.gif" alt="image\ImportDiagnostic.gif" title="image\ImportDiagnostic.gif" width="100" height="18" border="0" /></p>
<p>New button: Import Diagnostic Cost</p>
<p>The function of this button is to import all costs associated with the quote’s lead work order (or the work order you select) so that they may be presented on the quote being prepared to correct the diagnosed problem. A typical scenario would be:</p>
<p style="margin-left: 36.00pt;">A technician is sent on a service call. He diagnoses the problem, but the job is big enough to require a quote before proceeding.</p>
<p style="margin-left: 36.00pt;">The real time spent on the diagnosis is entered on the work order.</p>
<p style="margin-left: 36.00pt;">In the Quote, the tech’s work order is used as the lead work order.</p>
<p style="margin-left: 66.25pt;">Option 1 is created for the proposed work to be done.</p>
<p style="margin-left: 66.25pt;">Option 2 is added: the Import Diagnostic Costs button is click to import the time spent on the lead work order.</p>
<p style="margin-left: 36.00pt;">The Quote is printed for the customer, showing both the work to be done and the diagnostic work already incurred.</p>
<p style="margin-left: 66.25pt;">If Option 1 is accepted, the user approves Option 1, and declines Option 2. When the Approval wizard is run, the Option 1 charges will be added to the diagnostic charges already on the work order.</p>
<p style="margin-left: 66.25pt;">If Option 1 is declined, the user will mark Option 1 and Option 2 declined, closing the quote. The customer will be billed from the lead work order, which already includes the diagnostic charges.</p>
<p>Note that in both cases, the option for the diagnostic charges would be declined, so that that they are not billed twice on the lead work order.</p>
<h3>12.4.6 Diagnostic Cost Wizard</h3>
<p>Purpose:</p>
<p>This function is invoked when click the Import Diagnostic Cost button on the Scope tab. When you do so, the system will automatically step you through the processes needed to import all costs associated with the quote’s lead work order (or the work order you select) so that they may be presented on the quote being prepared to correct the diagnosed problem.</p>
<p>Important Buttons:</p>
<p>Each Wizard screen includes buttons on the lower margin.</p>
<p style="margin-left: 36.00pt;">The <font style="font-weight: bold;">Cancel</font> button should be clicked when to end the approval process.</p>
<p style="margin-left: 36.00pt;">The <font style="font-weight: bold;">Next</font> button should be clicked to continue the approval process and proceed to the next screen when you have verified that all the options in the current screen have been set correctly.</p>
<p style="margin-left: 36.00pt;">The <font style="font-weight: bold;">Back</font> button returns you to the previous screen.</p>
<p style="margin-left: 36.00pt;">The <font style="font-weight: bold;">Finish</font> button is displayed on the final Wizard screen. When you click it, the system will ask you to confirm the posting of lines to your Work and Purchase Orders.</p>

<p><font style="font-weight: bold;">New Field – WO</font> <font style="font-weight: bold;">Display</font><font style="font-weight: bold;">:<br /></font>If the Quote is being written to a new Work Order, the designation ‘New’ will appear in the WO Id column. Lines for the original source Work Order will also appear, and may be updated by the user if needed.</p>
<p>If the quote is being written to an existing Work Order, a new line will be added to it and it will appear at the top of the list. Its Id will appear in the WO Id column, followed by an asterisk * indicating that it will be added to the Technician tab. Existing lines source Work Order will also appear, and may be updated by the user if needed.</p>
<p><font style="font-weight: bold;">Technician Lines appear in the Wizard according to the following rules:</font></p>
<p style="margin-left: 36.00pt;">1. When Export to Existing WO is selected, the existing tech lines from the source work order are shown, plus any new lines added for Subcontractor Techs generated from the Subcontractor tab; the WO Display field will display the source WO Id followed by a asterisk * for these new lines.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">&#160;</p>
<h2>12.6 Handling of Option Codes with Uppercase Text</h2>
<p><font style="font-weight: bold;">Quote Viewer</font><font style="font-weight: bold;">:</font></p>
<p>This release corrects a problem encountered if the Scope's Option Code included uppercase text, but the detail tabs referencing it Option Code used lowercase text. This could result in the non-Fixed Price totals displayed on Scope tab not correctly reflecting the detail amounts or the printed quote. In this release, text Option Codes are handled correctly in new quotes, regardless of whether they are entered in upper or lower case.</p>
<p><font style="font-weight: bold; font-style: italic;">For existing (but not fully approved) Quotes, click the Revenue Adjust button to synchronize the Scope Option revenues for non-Fixed Price quotes with the revenue amounts on the detail tabs.</font></p>

Later in the day, a user changes one of these work orders (from the work order itself, or other viewers such as the Job or Labor Journals. Finally, the service invoices are printed and posted – but the one that was altered now differs from what was approved earlier that day.</p>
<p>The following global setting option forces an ‘Invoice Ready’ work order back to the 'Invoice Review' status if it is changed.</p>
<p><font style="font-weight: bold;">Id:</font> sys-ffv-global-settings</p>
<p><font style="font-weight: bold;">Setting Key:</font> ResetComputedWorkOrdersWhenChanged <font style="font-weight: bold;">Setting Value:</font> true (default is false)</p>
<p>If this registry is implemented, the following message will appear when an Invoice Ready work order is changed:</p>
<p style="margin-left: 36.00pt;">This action requires setting Work Order ###### to Invoice Review. Is it Ok to reset the work order’s status?</p>
<p>If the user clicks Yes, the work order will be reset and the change will be allowed. If the user clicks No, the change is denied.</p>

<h3>16.1.6 Options to Write the Service Tasks and/or Service Parts List to New Call Work Orders</h3>
<p>This enhancement enables the Service Parts and/or Service Tasks Lists to be written to the Work Order Equipment Tab’s Work Requested, regardless of the Work Order Type selected. In previous releases, the Service Tasks List was ONLY written to New Call Work Orders of type Installation. This new registry also pertains to Work Orders from TechAnywhere and Web Logs.</p>
<p>Note: if both registries below are enabled, the service task list should be written first, a line of space, followed by the service parts list.</p>
<p><font style="font-weight: bold;">Id:</font> sys-newcall</p>
<p><font style="font-weight: bold;">Setting Key:</font> ServiceParts&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;<font style="font-weight: bold;">Setting Value:</font> workrequested</p>
<p>If this registry option is enabled, the system will write ALL Service Parts from the Equipment record's Service Parts List to the Work Order Equipment Tab’s Work Requested, regardless of the Work Order Type being created. If this registry setting is enabled, the Service Parts Id will also be written to the Work Order Equipment line.</p>
<p><font style="font-weight: bold;">Setting Key:</font> ServiceTasks&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;<font style="font-weight: bold;">Setting Value:</font> workrequested<br />
<br />
If this registry option is enabled, the system will write the Service Tasks from the Equipment record's Service Task List to the Work Equipment Tab’s Work Requested, regardless of the Work Order Type being created. If this registry setting is enabled, the Service Tasks&#160;Id will also be written to the Work Order Equipment line.</p>

<h2>16.2 Reports</h2>
<h2>16.3 Master Contract</h2>
<h3>16.3.1 Main Tab</h3>
<p><font style="font-weight: bold;">New Field: Revenue Values as %</font><font style="font-weight: bold;">:<br /></font>This enhancement enables the user to designate the Revenue specified on the PM Schedule line of a master contract as a percentage instead of a dollar amount for Time Of Service Bill invoices. If TimeOfService Bill is not specified, the Amount Billed on the Adv. Bill tab will be calculated as a percentage. If Amortization is enabled, the Amount Earned is also calculated as a percentage.</p>
<p>When generating Time of Service PM Work Orders or PM Billings, the system will calculate the billable amount for as a percentage of the annual contract amount specified on the Client Site list. Amortized amounts will similarly be generated using the Amount Earned percentage in the Adv. Bill tab.</p>
<p>When the user saves the record, the system will verify that the sum of the Revenue percentages totals 100.00.</p>
<h3>16.3.2 Filter Tab</h3>
<p><font style="font-weight: bold;">New Range: Site Name</font><br />
The Client Site Name has been added to the Filter tab. The Filter tab enables you to auto-populate the sites included in this contract by filling in one or more of the following ranges, and then clicking the Auto Populate button.</p>
<h3>16.3.3 Schedule Tab</h3>
<p>The system now allows changes to all Schedule tab fields except the Month and Day even though Equipment PM lines already exist. This allows fields (such as the Work Code) to be changed now so they will be correctly set for the following year.</p>
<h3>16.3.4 PM Invoices</h3>
<p>Client Site Billing Schedule lines already include a 3000 character Extended Description field. When creating new Billing Schedule lines from Master Contracts, the system now sets the line's Extended Description to the associated Billing Item's Invoice Description.</p>
<p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">&#160;</p>
<h2>16.4 Work Codes</h2>
<p><font style="font-weight: bold;">New Fields: Work Code User1-5</font><br />
These fields may be used to record additional information required by your company.</p>
<h2>16.5 &#160;Log Forms</h2>
<p>The Log Form Id has been expanded from 5 to 15 characters.</p>
<h2>16.6 PCR (Problem, Cause, Remedy)</h2>
<h3>16.6.1 PCR Overview</h3>
<p>The purpose of the new Problem, Cause, Remedy functionality is to enforce consistency between the Problem reported (the Work Code), the Cause of the problem (the new Cause Code), and the Remedy (the Resolution Code). This consistency is enabled via the new PCR Table which defines which Causes may be selected for each Work Code (Problem), as well as which Remedy (Resolution) Code may be selected for each Cause Code.</p>
<p>If a PCR Table is specified in the Client Site it will be used for the validation of for all Equipment whose PCR Table Id is blank. If a PCR Table is specified in the Client Site Equipment record, it overrides the PCR Table in the Client Site record. Generally, ONLY the Client Site Equipment PCR Table would be completed.</p>
<p>In SAMPro, if a PCR table is referenced, Work Codes are validated in:</p>
<p style="margin-left: 36.00pt;">1. New Call<br />
2. Work Order<br />
3. Dispatch Board<br />
4. Client Site Equipment (PM Schedule tab)<br />
5. Quote – Main Tab (if a lead work order is used, the Work Code defaults from it. If a lead work order is not specified, and a PCR Table is specified in the Site, the Work Code list will be limited to those referenced in the Site.<br />
<br />
SAMPro validates that Cause Codes are associated with the PCR table Work Code in:<br />
1. PCR Table<br />
2. Work Order<br />
<br />
The system validates that the Resolution Code is associated with the PCR Cause Code in the Work Order.</p>
<p>TechAnywhere also supports the PCR validations.</p>
<h3>16.6.2 Cause Code (new record)</h3>
<p><font style="font-weight: bold;">Purpose:</font></p>
<p>This record may be used to identify the cause of a problem identified by a Work Code. For example, a typical Work Code for an air conditioning unit might be NoCool. A variety of causes (defined by the Cause Code) could have led to this problem: Belt, Filter, Blower, Compressor, and so on.</p>
<p>Cause Codes do not have to be specific to a particular work code. In this example, they could also be applicable to a Work Code of NoHeat.</p>
<p><font style="font-weight: bold;">Usage:</font></p>
<p>Referenced in the PCR Table and Work Order.</p>
<p><font style="font-weight: bold;">Important Fields:</font></p>
<p><font style="font-weight: bold;">Cause Code Id:<br /></font>This required field uniquely Identifies this cause (e.g., Belt, Filter, CondCoil, Compressor, etc.).</p>
<p><font style="font-weight: bold;">Cause Code Name:<br /></font>This recommended field may be used provide greater detail on the cause (e.g., if the Id is EVAPCOIL the Name could be Evaporator Coil). This field may also be used for reporting purposes.</p>
<p><font style="font-weight: bold;">Cause Code User 1-5:<br /></font>These optional fields may be used for entering any information your company wishes to retain.</p>
<p><font style="font-weight: bold;">Obsolete</font><font style="font-weight: bold;">?</font><font style="font-weight: bold;"><br /></font>If this field is checked, the record is considered Obsolete, and it may not be directly specified during data-entry (either by entering the Id or selecting it from a list). Obsoleted records can be edited and the Obsolete option can be un-done when necessary. When you check the Obsolete field, the following message box will be displayed:</p>
<p style="margin-left: 36.00pt;">“You have elected to obsolete this record. Would you like to see existing references to this record?”</p>
<p>If you click Yes, the system will display a viewer that provides click-through access to all tables referencing this record.</p>
<h3>16.6.3 PCR Table</h3>
<p><font style="font-weight: bold;">Purpose:</font></p>
<p>The purpose of the new PCR Table is to enforce consistency between the Problem reported (the Work Code), the Cause of the problem (the Cause Code), and the Remedy (the Resolution Code). This consistency is enabled via the PCR Table’s Problems tab which defines which Causes may be selected for each Work Code (Problem), and by the Remedies tab which defined which Remedy (Resolution) Code may be selected for each Cause Code.</p>
<p>If a PCR Table is specified in the Client Site it will be used for the validation of for all Equipment whose PCR Table Id is blank. If a PCR Table is specified in the Client Site Equipment record, it overrides the PCR Table in the Client Site record. Typically, this field would only be completed in the Equipment record.</p>
<p><font style="font-weight: bold;">Important Fields: Upper Section</font></p>

<p><font style="font-weight: bold;">Important Fields:</font> <font style="font-weight: bold;">Lower Section</font></p>
<p><font style="font-weight: bold;">Problem Tab</font></p>
<p>This tab defines which Causes may be selected for each Work Code (Problem).</p>
<p><font style="font-weight: bold;">Work Code Id: Cause Code Id:<br /></font>Each line defines a valid problem/cause pair. Each Work Code (problem) may be listed multiple times if has multiple causes. For example, a NoCool problem could be caused by a refrigerant leak, electrical outage, and so on.</p>
<p><font style="font-weight: bold;">Remedies Tab</font></p>
<p>This tab defines which Causes may be selected for each Work Code (Problem).</p>
<p><font style="font-weight: bold;">Cause Code Id: Resolution Code Id::<br /></font>Each line defines a valid cause/remedy pair. Each Cause Code may be listed multiple times if has multiple resolutions. A Control Cause Code might be associated with remedies (resolution codes) of Repair or Replace.</p>
<p>When you double-click to select a Cause Code, the list will be limited to those that appear on the Problem tab; only Cause Codes that appear on the Problems tab should be included on the Remedies tab.</p>
<h3>16.6.4 Changed Records – PCR Implementation</h3>
<p><font style="font-weight: bold;">Client Site</font></p>
<p style="margin-left: 36.00pt;"><font style="font-weight: bold;">Main Tab - New Field: PCR Table Id:<br /></font>If a PCR Table is specified in the Client Site it will be used for the validation of for all Equipment whose PCR Table Id is blank. If a PCR table is referenced, Work/Cause/Resolution Codes are validated in New Call, the Work Order, the Dispatch Board and the Quote – Main Tab (if a lead work order is used, the Work Code defaults from it.

If a PCR table is referenced, PCR validation is provided in New Call, the Work Order, the Dispatch Board, and the Client Site Equipment PM Schedule tab. In the Quote, if a lead work order is used, the Work Code defaults from it. If a lead work order is not specified, and a PCR Table is specified in the Site, the Work Code list will be limited to those referenced in the Site.</p>
<p><font style="font-weight: bold;">Work Order</font><font style="font-weight: bold;">:</font> <font style="font-weight: bold;">Work Order Equipment Tab:</font></p>
<p style="margin-left: 36.00pt;"><font style="font-weight: bold;">Changed Field: Work Code Id:<br /></font> If PCR functionality is enabled, the system will validate the Work Code is specified in the PCR Table (in the Client Site / Client Site Equipment) when a Work Code is entered or changed. The PCR Table in the Client Site Equipment record overrides the PCR Table in the Client Site record.</p>
<p style="margin-left: 36.00pt;"><font style="font-weight: bold;">New Field: Cause Code Id:<br /></font>This field may be used to specify the cause of the problem defined by the Work Code.

<h2>16.7 Work Order Viewer</h2>
<p>New validation prevents the user from importing costs after accidentally deleting the WO Id.</p>
<p>This release corrects a sporadic problem where the Closing Call Script Loaded flag was not always set when the Closing Call Script was run.</p>
<p>Validation now requires that a Job is present when importing a Flat Rate. If the Work Order header Job is blank, the system will display the following message and not allow the import when the Flat Rate button is clicked: ‘Flat rate cannot import when workorder has no job entered’.</p>
<p>In previous releases, if a user accessed a work order with tech lines previously set to ‘completed’ and then marked the work order Invoice Ready, the spurious message “Warning: not all Technician Lines are set to completed, invoice ready, or invoice review. Are you sure you want to set to invoice ready?” would appear. This has been corrected so that the message not longer appears when it should not.</p>
<h3>16.7.1 New Work Order GLH Tab</h3>
<p>This release Implements a new GLH parent tab in journals that post to GL History. This tab displays the GL History postings associated with the selected transaction. The following columns appear on this tab:</p>

<h3>16.7.6 Work Order Purchases Tab</h3>
<p>Previously, all Credit PO’s displayed as received on the Work Order’s Purchases tab. For Credit PO's, the Purchase tab now shows a zero quantity if the item has not been received, or the applicable negative number if it has been received.</p>
<p>The Date Promised for each purchase line is now shown on this tab in the Promised column.</p>
<p>A new column, Confirming, has been added to this tab. This column will be set to Yes if the PO’s Confirming? box is checked, or No if it is clear.</p>
<p>This column allows for easy communication between the parts manager and the service department. If a PO is flagged as Confirming, it indicates that the parts manager has already delivered the PO to the vendor. If it is not flagged as Confirming, this operation needs to be completed.</p>
<p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">&#160;</p>
<h3>16.7.7 Work Order Inventory Tab</h3>
<p><font style="font-weight: bold;">Changed Field: Inventory Id:<br /></font>The system now checks to see if a part has been superceded (the Superceded By field on the Inventory Other Tab is filled in). When a superseded part number is entered into this field, the system will alert the user that</p>
<p style="margin-left: 36.00pt;">Item A has been superceded by Item B. Use New Item?</p>
<p>It the user clicks Yes, the new part (B) will be returned to the field. If the user clicks No, part A (which has been superceded) will remain in the field.</p>
<h3>16.7.8 Work Order Required Resources Tab</h3>
<p><font style="font-weight: bold;">Changed Field: Inventory Id:<br /></font>The system now checks to see if a part has been superceded (the Superceded By field on the Inventory Other Tab is filled in). When a superseded part number is entered into this field, the system will alert the user that</p>
<p style="margin-left: 36.00pt;">Item A has been superceded by Item B. Use New Item?</p>
<p>It the user clicks Yes, the new part (B) will be returned to the field. If the user clicks No, part A (which has been superceded) will remain in the field.</p>
<h3>16.7.9 Work Order Invoicing Tab</h3>
<p><font style="font-weight: bold;">First Date Worked: Last Date Worked:<br /></font>These display-only fields are extracted from Job History based on the earliest and latest non-zero labor entries associated with this Work Order. Only actual labor hours are included: “quoted” labor is not included in the calculation.</p>
<p><font style="font-weight: bold;">Changed Field: Invoice Ready<br /></font>When the user flags a Work Order as Invoice Ready, the system now includes the Wait Paperwork status among those tech statues (Completed, Invoice Ready, Invoice Review) that will be automatically changed to Invoice Ready. The user will also be warned if some technician lines are not set to ''Completed'', ''Invoice Review'', ''InvoiceApproved'', or ''Wait Paperwork'’ when a work order is flagged as invoice ready.</p>
<p><font style="font-weight: bold;">Changed Field: Date Work</font> <font style="font-weight: bold;">Completed</font><br />
If the global registry option DateWorkCompletedToday was set to true, the Date Work Completed was always set to today then the work order was ‘completed’. In this release, it is only set to Today if it is blank. If this registry is not enabled, the Date Work Completed will always be derived from the most recent date on the Technicians tab when it is considered completed.</p>
<p>Note that a Work Order is considered ‘completed’ if:</p>
<p style="margin-left: 36.00pt;">At least one Tech line is set to 'completed', 'wait paperwork', 'invoice ready' or 'invoicedisputed')</p>
<p style="margin-left: 36.00pt;">AND</p>
<p style="margin-left: 36.00pt;">The WO Escalation Status Category is to 'completed' or 'pending ok to invoice')</p>
<h3>16.7.10 Work Order Labor Tab</h3>
<p>If the Hours (worked) is zero, the system no longer validates the effective date falls within the Pay Period date range.</p>
<p><font style="font-weight: bold;">Approving Time:<br /></font>This functionality enables users to review/approve time entered in TechAnywhere, indicating that this time does not need to be reviewed prior to billing. To do so, right-click on a line. No special user attribute is required: all that is needed is for someone other than the tech to ‘touch’ the entry.</p>
<p>Three registry entries are required for this functionality: please see user note 17.1 for details: one to split TechAnywhere time into separate labor journals by work order, and another two to allow approval in the Work Order and Labor Journals.</p>
<h3>16.7.11 Work Order Quote Tab</h3>
<p><font style="font-weight: bold;">New Column – Scope WO<br /></font>The Work Order Id (from the Quote Scope line) now appears on the new Scope WO column. This column will only be completed when the approval wizard has been successfully run for that option.</p>
<h3>16.7.12 Work Order List View</h3>
<p>The 'WorkOrdersByBranchIdByWorkOrderId' list now shows only one line per Work Order.&#160;&#160;The Work Order Escalation Status, WO PO, Client Id and Client Name have been added to this list.</p>
<p><br /></p>
<h2>16.8 Dispatch Board</h2>
<p>This release corrects a sporadic “[ODBC SQL Server Driver] Connection is busy with results for another hstmt” error encountered by some users.</p>
<p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">&#160;</p>
<h3>16.8.1 Work Order List (lower section)</h3>
<p>The Begin Date column has been relabeled as Scheduled to better reflect its meaning as the Technician’s Date Scheduled. After the data-conversion, the Scheduled column will end up in the same place at the Begin Date did before in the user’s Dispatch Boards.</p>
<p>The Client Name (from the WO’s Job) has been added as a column to the work order list (the lower half of the Dispatch Board). This column will initially appear at the extreme right-hand side of the board, but may be repositioned via drag and drop.</p>
<h3>16.18.2 Create PO button – support for intercompany processing</h3>
<p>When a WO is selected and the Create PO sidebar button is pressed, the PO viewer will be launched with the new GL Entity field on the Status tab set from the PO’s Location (which also defaults from the Work Order). The Work Order Id will be completed in the PO header as in previous versions.</p>
<h3>16.18.3 Classic Board</h3>
<p>The Directions to Site field has been returned to the Work Order Summary (lower section) of the Classic Board. If you are currently running Version 8.1, a revised v.cus file is required to see the change.</p>
<p>The Work Order Summary of the Classic Board now displays the Dispatch Note from the Client Site record below the Work Order Comments field.</p>
<p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">&#160;</p>
<h2>16.9 New Call</h2>
<p>This release corrects a non-continuable protection violation error that could sporadically occur when changing the Search For button from Alpha to Any.</p>
<p>Selecting a Work Code no longer resets the Job ID back to the Equipment’s default Job. &#160;</p>
<p>The Work Order User 1 Field in New Call supports the double click Custom Field functionality.</p>
<p>If the Service Category field is completed, double-clicking the Work Code field once again displays a list that is automatically filtered to only active work codes referencing that service category.</p>
<p>Credit Hold processing (the Site / Client is set to Credit Hold, or the Client’s AR Days are exceeded) is once again supported; this was a problem in recent versions.</p>
<h3>16.9.1 New Call – New COD Site</h3>
<p>Improved error message if a new COD Site is not created.</p>
<p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">&#160;</p>
<h3>16.9.2 Other Lines Auto-generated from Client Site WO Other Tab</h3>
<p>When a work order is created, and an Other line is automatically generated from the Client Site's WO Other tab, the appropriate GL History entries will be generated if the Accounting Period’s WO Other to GL box is flagged.</p>
<p>To determine the correct Accounting Period, the system will look at the date to use on the WO Other line (either the date scheduled, or today's date if there is no scheduled date). If the date is with the default Accounting Period, it will use that. If the date is NOT within the default Accounting Period, it will find the appropriate active Accounting Period and use that.</p>
<p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">&#160;</p>
<h3>16.9.3 Web Log</h3>
<p>When a Web Log with the Equipment Id set from TechAnywhere is processed in New Call, it does not automatically select the Equipment (although the Site will be still be selected).</p>
<p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">&#160;</p>
<h3>16.9.4 Master Contract Pane</h3>
<p><img src="image/SKIN1_showMCP.gif" alt="image\SKIN1_showMCP.gif" title="image\SKIN1_showMCP.gif" width="94" height="28" border="0" /></p>
<p>This new sidebar button toggles the New Call display between the Client Site (middle) pane and the new Master Contract pane. A Client Site must be selected before clicking the button. The new Master Contract pane displays all Contracts associated with the selected Site. Contracts are listed in descending order of the Master Contract Date End. Doubling-clicking on a Contract list will open the Master Contract record.</p>
<p>See Customer Release Note 16.1.5 for a registry entry to automatically display (or prompt the user to access) the Master Contract Pane.</p>
<h2>16.10 Resolution Code</h2>
<p><font style="font-weight: bold;">New Fields:</font></p>
<p><font style="font-weight: bold;">Resolution</font> <font style="font-weight: bold;">Code User 1-5:<br /></font>These optional fields may be used for entering any information your company wishes to retain.</p>
<p><font style="font-weight: bold;">Obsolete</font><font style="font-weight: bold;">?</font><font style="font-weight: bold;"><br /></font>If this field is checked, the record is considered Obsolete, and it may not be directly specified during data-entry (either by entering the Id or selecting it from a list). Obsoleted records can be edited and the Obsolete option can be un-done when necessary. When you check the Obsolete field, the following message box will be displayed:</p>
<p style="margin-left: 36.00pt;">“You have elected to obsolete this record. Would you like to see existing references to this record?”</p>
<p>If you click Yes, the system will display a viewer that provides click-through access to all tables referencing this record.</p>
<h2>16.11 Refrigerant Tracking</h2>

<p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">&#160;</p>
<h2>16.12 Web Log</h2>
<p><font style="font-weight: bold;">New Field: Technician Id</font>:<br />
If this Web Log was generated by a Technician or Subcontractor user, the Technician Id and Name will appear in this display-only field. A new v.cus file will be needed to see this field if your upgrade to this version did not trigger a database conversion.</p>
<p><font style="font-weight: bold;">New Field: Equipment Id</font><font style="font-weight: bold;">:</font><br />
The Weblog viewer now displays the Equipment Id (if set from TechAnywhere). When a Web Log with the Equipment Id set is processed in New Call, it does not automatically select the Equipment (although the Site will be still be selected).</p>
<h3>16.12.1 Web Log Escalation</h3>
<p>This version corrects a problem in recent releases: if TechAnywhere Web Logs were created with an equipment record, their escalation events were not generated. Restart the Scheduled Event Manager (and other agent-type users) when installing this release so that this fix will be available.</p>
<p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">&#160;</p>
<h2>16.13 Create PM WOs</h2>
<p>This release corrects a 'key is missing' error when running Create PM Workorders where one of PM’s will be for a Sub, and a PO needs to be generated.</p>
<p>See Customer Release Note 16.1.2 for a registry to controls the initial setting of each Checklist line's Do box to set it to False (blank) if a site requires a PO and the Customer PO is unknown.</p>
<h3>16.13.1 Range Screen</h3>
<p><font style="font-weight: bold;">New Fields:</font></p>
<p><font style="font-weight: bold;">Default Tech Id:<br /></font> The Default Tech Id will default to the Checklist screen if the Tech id on the PM Work Order would have been blank (unassigned). It will not override a Technician assigned from the Equipment record’s PM Schedule tab, the Equipment record’s Main tab, or the Client Site.</p>
<p><font style="font-weight: bold;">Work Requested:<br /></font>If completed, this field will default to the following Checklist screen. It will be used to set the Work Requested header of the generated PM work order.</p>
<h3>16.13.2 Checklist Screen</h3>
<p><font style="font-weight: bold;">New Fields:</font></p>
<p><font style="font-weight: bold;">Tech Id:<br /></font> This field defaults from the previous Range screen (if the Tech id on the PM Work Order would have been blank.

<h2>16.14 Scheduled Event Manager</h2>
<h3>16.14.1 Canceling Work Orders</h3>
<p>Canceling a work order now also cancels existing, non-tech based scheduled events: this prevents messages from continuing to execute for cancelled work orders. In this release, if the Work Order Escalation Status goes to Cancelled, applicable tech-based escalations are run (for example, one notifying the technician the WO was cancelled), and then existing (non-tech based) scheduled events are cancelled.</p>
<p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">&#160;</p>
<h2>16.15 Taylor Universal WOs</h2>
<p>Type 3 records are used to report the contents of a Work Order's "Other" and "Labor" tabs. An "<font style="font-weight: bold; text-decoration: underline;">M</font>" (for Material) is entered into the Type 3 "Other" records "Category" field. In this release, an exception to the above is made for PM Work Orders (Work Order Type "preventivemaint"). Type 3 "Other" records deriving from PM Work Orders should have the "Category" field set to "<font style="font-weight: bold; text-decoration: underline;">L</font>" (for Labor).</p>

<p>This release corrects an issue where an invalid Equipment ID in the refrigerant tracking section crashed the TechAnywhere Post. In this release, the message is failed if the Equipment ID is not correct.</p>
<p>In this release, the TechAnywhere posting logic now finds and corrects any bogus year values before updating client site equipment. The Year should contain exactly four digits, no decimal points or spaces.</p>
<p>If CODs are not auto-posted, the system no longer auto-increments the AR Invoice counter to reduce ‘skipped’ invoice numbers and eliminate Document references to ‘ghost’ invoices.</p>
<p>This release corrects the duplication of COD payment information when reposting a fixed message.</p>
<p>This release corrects a “Key is missing error” when posting purchase orders from TechAnywhere.</p>
<h2>17.1 Registry</h2>
<h3>17.1.1 Time Review Registries</h3>
<h3>TechAnywhere Time Review</h3>
<p>This functionality enables users to review time entered in TechAnywhere, indicating that this time does not need additional review prior to billing. A custom PR Time Entry report is used to indicate which time has/has not been reviewed. Note that un-reviewed time may be billed for and/or paid to the technician.</p>
<p>To approve time, a user may simply access the Labor Journal, and save the entry (with any corrections needed).</p>
<p>Time may also be approved from the Word Order Revenue tab by right-clicking on a line. No special user attribute is required: all that is needed is for someone other than the tech to ‘touch’ the entry.</p>
<p>The three registry entries listed below are required for this functionality: please see user note 17.1 for details: one to split TechAnywhere time into separate labor journals by work order, and another two to allow approval in the Work Order and Labor Journals.</p>
<h3>Post Labor By Work Order</h3>
<p><font style="font-weight: bold;">Id:</font> sys-techanywhere</p>
<p><font style="font-weight: bold;">Setting Key:</font> PostLaborByWorkorder <font style="font-weight: bold;">Setting Value:</font> true<br />
<br />
With this registry setting in place, individual labor journals will be created to break out a journal per work order if multiple work orders are contained in a labor message payload.</p>
<h3>Time Review – Work Order</h3>
<p><font style="font-weight: bold;">Id:</font> sys-viewer-vwrkordr</p>
<p>Setting Key: AllowLaborJournalApproval Setting Value: true</p>
<h3>Time Review – Labor Journal</h3>
<p><font style="font-weight: bold;">Id:</font> sys-viewer-vlbrjrnl</p>
<p><font style="font-weight: bold;">Setting Key:</font> ApproveWhenEdited <font style="font-weight: bold;">Setting Value:</font> true (default false)</p>
<h3>17.1.2 TechAnywhere Discounts</h3>
<p>TechAnywhere 2.7 Android will now create Revenue Adjustment lines based on the discounts the tech took in the field. The following registry option must be implemented to provide the correct cost category for the Revenue Adjustment:</p>
<p><font style="font-weight: bold;">Id:</font> sys-techanywhere</p>
<p><font style="font-weight: bold;">Setting Key:</font> DiscountCostCategory <font style="font-weight: bold;">Setting Value:</font> <font style="font-style: italic;">CostCategoryId of discount</font></p>
<h3>17.1.3 Control CRM Viewable Documents by File Extension</h3>
<p>By default, all documents sent over from TechAnywhere are flagged as CRMViewable when posted to SAMPro. With this registry setting you can control by file extension if you do not want a certain file type to post with the CRM Viewable flag checked. This is a temporary fix as TechAnywhere will eventually give technician control of the CRMViewable flag (Old CRM + New FM) for attached collateral.</p>
<p><font style="font-weight: bold;">Registry Id:</font> sys-techAnywhere</p>
<p><font style="font-weight: bold;">Setting Key:</font> NonCRMViewableTypes <font style="font-weight: bold;">Setting Value:</font> list of file type extensions</p>
<p>The Setting Value provides a list of the file extensions that you don't want flagged as CRM Viewable. For example:</p>
<p style="margin-left: 36.00pt;">Setting Key: NonCRMViewableTypes Setting Value: jpg,jpeg</p>
<p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">&#160;</p>
<h2>17.2 Reports</h2>
<h2>17.3 TechAnywhere Quotes</h2>
<p>This enhancement enables TechAnywhere technicians to submit Open or Declined Quotes and their options to create quotes in SAMPro QuoteMaster. Quote collateral will be attached to the lead Work Order as well as the Quote and Site. All 'web viewable' flags for the collateral will be set to No. The CollateralDirectory defined in sys-techanywhere will be used for the collateral upload.</p>
<p>In TechAnywhere, a “Unit Down” check box has been added to the Scope of Service screen.</p>
<p style="margin-left: 36.00pt;">When the 'Unit Down' field is checked, the new Quote's header Description is set to 'Unit Down’.</p>
<p style="margin-left: 36.00pt;">If Unit Down not checked and the work order is a Service work order, ‘Found on Service Call' is written to the Quote Description field.<br />
If Unit Down not checked and the work order is a PM work order, 'Found on PM Visit' will be written to the Quote Description field.</p>
<p>Quotes posted from TechAnywhere can be either Fixed Price or T&amp;M.&#160;For T&amp;M quotes, when a quote detail line does NOT include pricing info (Unit Price, Price = zero), the system will perform the standard revenue rate calculations appropriate for the line.</p>
<h2>17.4 TechAnywhere Purchase Orders</h2>
<p>When Purchase Orders are created in Tech Anywhere, the Confirming? check box is now flagged because they are all confirmed with the parts vendor.</p>
<p>TechAnywhere PO’s with an invalid Vendor ID will not be posted, and an email detailing the error will be sent to support.</p>
<h3>17.4.1 Technician and Part Runner Mode</h3>
<p>The TechAnywhere Android setup will allow a technician to work in 1 of 2 ways: Technician mode or Part Runner mode.</p>
<p style="margin-left: 36.00pt;">In Technician mode, the tech can view purchase orders that contain un-received items that are associated with any of his assigned work orders. The tech can mark the items received in TechAnywhere, which will create an inventory receipt journal transaction to mark those items received in SAMPro. The tech also has the ability to change the associated site equipment record on the item which will then change the purchase order and purchase order history to reflect the new equipment.</p>
<p style="margin-left: 36.00pt;">In Part Runner mode, the technician has access to ANY purchase order that contains any un-received items. In this mode, technician does NOT have the ability to change the associated equipment record, but may mark items as received.</p>
<p>Contact your TechAnywhere support rep to enable this feature for your technicians.</p>
<h2>17.5 TechAnywhere Recommendations (Web Logs)</h2>
<p>This enhancement to the techanywhere posting allows recommendations (web logs) to be recorded by equipment. The post is still compatible with the previous TechAnywhere functionality which does not link the service recommendation to the equipment. When a Web Log with the Equipment Id set is processed in New Call, it does not automatically select the Equipment (although the Site will be still be selected).</p>
<h2>17.6 TechAnywhere Flat Rate Imports</h2>
<p>TechAnywhere allows non-integer flat rate quantities which could result in a posting error because only integer Flat Rate quantities were allowed in SAMPro. SAMPro now supports Flat Rate quantities other than integers in Work Orders, Quotes, and the TechAnywhere Post.</p>
<p>The TechAnywhere post now fails the message if trying to post a flat rate to a Work Order that doesn't have a Job.</p>
<p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">&#160;</p>
<h1>18 Service Channel</h1>
<p>This release creates the fmmsinfo and fmmsmppng tables with the required unique indexes.</p>
<p>When the New Call user selects an incoming Service Channel Dispatch, a dialog box appears. A new button, 'Assign To WO' has been added: when clicked, a dialog requesting the entry of an existing Work Order Id appears. Once a valid Work Order has been entered, the new Dispatch will be attached to that Work Order.</p>
<h2>18.1 &#160;Additional Breakout of Charges for Service Channel</h2>
<p>SAMPro now supports the following charges to be broken out on the ServiceChannel Invoice Spreadsheet: Trip Charge, Material Total, Freight Charge, Markup. Previously, the Trip Charge and the Freight Charge were included in the Material Total. In addition, a separate Markup charge was not reported on the Invoice.</p>
<p>There are separate columns on the spreadsheet for Trip Charge, Material Total, and Freight Charge. The Markup amount is to be reported in the Other Charges columns.</p>
<p>Charges from the Work Order’s Other tab that are not identified as a Freight Charge or a Trip Charge will be included in the ‘Other Charges’ column.</p>
<p style="margin-left: 36.00pt;">If there is exactly one ‘Other Charge’, the Other Rate’s Description will appear in the ‘Other Charges Description’ column.</p>
<p style="margin-left: 36.00pt;">If there is more than one ‘Other Charge’, the word ‘Various’ will appear in the ‘Other Charges Description’ column.</p>
<p>Sampro registry entries will be required to implement these enhancements. The Sampro Registry entry for ‘sys-fmms-vendor-servicechannel’ will be used to identify:</p>
<h3>Other Rate Id’s that Identify Freight Charges</h3>
<p><font style="font-weight: bold;">Setting Key:</font> OtherCodesFreight</p>
<p><font style="font-weight: bold;">Setting Value:</font> A comma separated list of Other Rate Ids identifying Freight Charges.</p>
<h3>Other Rate Id’s that Identify Trip Charges</h3>
<p><font style="font-weight: bold;">Setting Key:</font> OtherCodesTravel</p>
<p><font style="font-weight: bold;">Setting Value:</font> A comma separated list of Other Rate Ids identifying trip charges.</p>
<h2>18.2 Specialized CVS Formatting</h2>
<p><font style="font-weight: bold;">Identifying CVS Clients</font></p>
<p>A Sampro user could potentially have ServiceChannel arrangements for a mixture of CVS and Generic clients. It is assumed that such a user would also produce a uniquely formatted paper invoice format for CVS. Within Sampro, the appropriate invoice format is identified by the Report Query Id found in the appropriate Job Billing Item record.</p>
<h3>Registry to Identify Clients Requiring Special CVS Spreadsheets</h3>
<p><font style="font-weight: bold;">Setting Key:</font> ReportQueriesForMarkupMode</p>
<p><font style="font-weight: bold;">Setting Value:</font> A comma separated list of Report Query Ids</p>
<p>These Report Query Ids will identify clients (via their Billing Items) requiring special CVS formatted ServiceChannel invoice spreadsheet lines.</p>
<p><font style="font-weight: bold;">For CVS type clients</font></p>
<p>Charges will appear in the ‘Freight Charges’ and ‘Trip Charge’ columns as determined by the same mechanism used by the ‘Generic’ type clients.</p>
<p>Charges that would (for ‘Generic type Clients) be included in the ‘Other Charges’ column will now appear in the ‘Material Total’ column. This will free up the ‘Other Charges’ column to be used for Markup.</p>
<p>Charges appearing in the ‘Material Total’ column will have to be classified as either being ‘Marked Up’ or as ‘Flat Rate’. This will be done by examining the charge’s ‘Billing Rate Type’. Charges from the Work Other’s ‘Other’ Tab will be considered as ‘Marked Up’ if and only if the Billing Rate Type is set to one of the ‘markup’ types of markup, margin or multiplier. Charges from the Work Order’s ‘Inventory’ Tab will always be considered as ‘Marked Up’.</p>
<p>If a charge is considered as ‘Marked Up’, the ‘Markup Amount’ will be included in the ‘Other Charges’ column but not in the ‘Material Total’ column.</p>
<p>If it is determined that the ‘Other Charges’ column will be non-zero, the ‘Other Charges Description’ column will be set to ‘Markup’. Otherwise it will be left blank.</p>
<h2>18.3 Other Charges Description</h2>
<p>In SAMPro invoices, the description of the ‘other’ charges comes from the Other Rate Description. However, ServiceChannel now only allows the following valid Other Charge Descriptions:</p>
<p>Discount<br />
Management Fee<br />
Markup<br />
Overhead &amp; Profit<br />
Rental Fee<br />
Shipping &amp; Handling<br />
Subcontractor Cost<br />
<br />
To ensure that the ServiceChannel invoice conforms to this standard, the following registry should be implemented to statically set the description:</p>
<p>Id: sys-fmms-servicechannel</p>
<p>Setting Key: OtherChargesDescription&#160;Setting Value: <font style="font-style: italic;">valid description</font><br />
<br />
If this entry is not found the description 'Not Found In Sampro Registry' will be used. Anytime a ServiceChannel invoice is generated and contains a dollar amount in the Other Charges Total section, it will need to use what is specified in the registry.</p>
<h3>18.3.1 Other Charge Description Sent to ServiceChannel</h3>
<p>In SAMPro invoices, the description of the ‘other’ charges comes from the Other Rate Description. However, ServiceChannel now only allows the following valid Other Charge Descriptions:</p>
<p style="margin-left: 36.00pt;">Discount<br />
Management Fee<br />
Markup<br />
Overhead &amp; Profit<br />
Rental Fee<br />
Shipping &amp; Handling<br />
Subcontractor Cost<br />
<br />
To ensure that the ServiceChannel invoice conforms to this standard, the following registry should be implemented to statically set the description:</p>
<p><font style="font-weight: bold;">Setting Key:</font> OtherChargesDescription&#160;<font style="font-weight: bold;">Setting Value:</font> valid description<br />
<br />
If this entry is not found the description 'Not Found In Sampro Registry' will be used. Anytime a ServiceChannel invoice is generated and contains a dollar amount in the Other Charges Total section, it will need to use what is specified in the registry.</p>
<h3>18.3.2 Registry Entries to Define Labor and Tax Subcontracting Charges</h3>
<p>This enhancement to Service Channel integration allows users to break out their Labor (Other Rate) subcontracting charges into the 'Labor Total' section of the ServiceChannel invoice format as well as for the tax that they pass on to the customer as an Other Rate to display in the 'Invoice Tax' section of the Service Channel invoice format.</p>
<p><font style="font-weight: bold;">Registry Id:</font> sys-fmms-vendor-servicechannel</p>
<p><font style="font-weight: bold;">Setting Key:</font> OtherCodesLabor <font style="font-weight: bold;">Setting Value:</font> list of other rates for labor</p>
<p><font style="font-weight: bold;">Setting Key:</font> OtherCodesTax <font style="font-weight: bold;">Setting Value:</font> list of other rates for tax</p>
<p>This release supports multiple lines for the same group of Other Codes (e.g. OtherCodesLabor). This is in case there are too many cpdes (e.g. OtherCodesLabor codes) to fit on a single line in the registry entry.</p>
<h2>18.4 Do Not Send Public Notes to ServiceChannel</h2>
<p>The following registry may be used to disable sending public notes to ServiceChannel; it would typically be enabled to prevent TechAnywhere created notes from being sent. Since there is not a way to determine if the note came from TechAnywhere or not, the only suitable solution is to create a registry setting that will disable this FMMS functionality.</p>
<p><font style="font-weight: bold;">Registry Id:</font> sys-fmms-vendor-servicechannel</p>
<p style="margin-left: 36.00pt;">(Or sys-fmms-vendorservicechannel--agenttech which will disable this function only for the techanywhere event manager)</p>
<p><font style="font-weight: bold;">Setting Key:</font> UploadNotes &#160;<font style="font-weight: bold;">Setting Value:</font> N</p>
<p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">&#160;</p>
<h1>19 TimeAnywhere</h1>
<p>In this release, the Description field in Labor Journal entries posted from TimeAnywhere is now blank. This change was made to prevent the description “TimeAnywhere Entry” from appearing in Construction Invoices.</p>
<p>If any part of a TimeAnywhere message fails posting, all entries are rolled back.</p>
<p>The Job Cost Category Id from the TimeAnywhere message is used when creating the labor entry. This Job Cost Category overrides any defaults that may get set from a labor rate.</p>
<h1>20 SageQuest</h1>
<h2>20.1 Start Work Order Daily Edit:</h2>
<p>Previously, clicking the Search Id button in the New Status field dropped the selected Status into the Log Type Id range. The Search Id button now correctly sets the New Status field.</p>
<p>This release fixes the scheduled date/time and estimated hours format so that SageQuest is correctly updated by this function.</p>
<p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">&#160;</p>

It also supports the rounding of Revenue amounts so the Quote viewer and standard report match.</p>
<p style="margin-left: 36.00pt;">In previous releases, the Approve All button only worked on Open and Accepted Options. In this release, it also sets Printed options to Approved.</p>

<p style="margin-left: 36.00pt;"><font style="font-weight: bold;">New Call:</font> Corrects a non-continuable protection violation error that could sporadically occur when changing the Search For button from Alpha to Any.</p>
<p style="margin-left: 36.00pt;"><font style="font-weight: bold;">Site Equipment</font> <font style="font-weight: bold;">Clone</font> <font style="font-weight: bold;">PM Button:</font> previously, this button only copied PM’s without an assigned work order.

<p><font style="font-weight: bold;">ServiceChannel</font></p>
<p style="margin-left: 36.00pt;">If a CHECK IN XML packet omits the SCHED_DATETIME field, the system now skips setting the Date and Time Scheduled on the Work Order's Technicians tab instead of erring out.</p>
<p style="margin-left: 36.00pt;">In SAMPro invoices, the description of the ‘other’ charges comes from the Other Rate Description but ServiceChannel now only allows specific Other Charge Descriptions. See Customer Release Note 18.3.1 for a registry entry to specify this description.</p>

The report (RPRVERI.rpt) dated 4/12/2012 has been <font style="font-weight: bold;">m</font>odified to skip these entries.</p>
<p style="margin-left: 36.00pt;"><font style="font-weight: bold;">Report PR Check Register:</font> The report (RPRREGR.rpt) dated May 6, 2013 has been updated so that it now prints the check numbers and check date when the Gross Earnings = Net Pay.&#160;</p>

<p style="margin-left: 36.00pt;">This release corrects a problem in recent images where the extended value negative quantity detail lines was off by a penny, resulting in a Tab Mismatch error.</p>
<p style="margin-left: 36.00pt;">Validation has also been added to prevent the Vendor Id from being completed on negative quantity Inventory and Material lines when the Quote is saved/added.</p>

<p><font style="font-weight: bold;">TechAnywhere:</font></p>
<p style="margin-left: 36.00pt;">TechAnywhere allows non-integer flat rate quantities which could result in a posting error because only integer Flat Rate quantities were allowed in SAMPro.
