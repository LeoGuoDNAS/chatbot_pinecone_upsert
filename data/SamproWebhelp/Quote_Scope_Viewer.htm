  <h1>Quote Scope Viewer</h1>
  <h2>Purpose:</h2>
  <p>The Quote Scope allows the user to focus on building a single Quote option at a time. Detailed lines are entered and adjusted on the Scope.  </p>
  <h2>Usage:</h2>
  <p>The Quote Manager viewer is used for approving Scopes and printing the Quote.</p>
  <p>All Notes attached to the Quote Manager and each of its associated Scopes will be available from the Quote Manager AND Quote Scope viewers. For example, for a quote with 2 scopes and notes entered on the Quote, Scope 1 and Scope 2, will have all 3 notes attached. </p>
  <p><span>Validation does not allow Approved Scopes to be deleted so that the link between the Quote and the Work Order is retained.  </span></p>
  <p><strong>Note: For versions 9.1.611.060 and up, the user IDs and time stamps on its state transition are noted in the Quote Scope. This provides history if there is an apparent need to investigate the data.</strong></p>

  </p>
  <p style="margin-left: 36.00pt;">
    <font style="font-weight: bold;">Expanded Scope of Services:</font><br/>
    The standard Quote report supports the ability to expand the printing of Scope Of Services by adding Notes attached to the Quote or Quote Manager record.  To enable this feature, the Notes Summary field must contain the Scope&#39;s Option Code.
  </p>
  <p><span style="font-weight: bold;">Work Order Id:</span><br/>
    This field displays the source Work Order for this Scope specified in the Quote Manager record.</p>
  <p>
    <font style="font-weight: bold;">Quote Amount:</font><br/>

  </p>
  <p>
    <font style="font-weight: bold;">Net Adjust:</font><br/>

  </p>
  <p>
    <font style="font-weight: bold;">Cost Category:</font><br/>
    The default cost category for fixed price quotations. Validation ensures that the Cost Category is always completed for a Fixed Price Scope, and is blank if it is not Fixed Price.

Scopes with a Diagnostic Status will be ignored when the Approve All Options button is clicked. The Approval Wizard will all ignore Diagnostic quotes. This functionality has the added benefit of not skewing the Analytics with &#39;declined&#39; options which were really diagnostics and not lost quotes. The Report Quote includes Diagnostics options.</span></p>

    If the Rate Schedule, Margin or Markup is changed, the system will recompute the prices on previously entered lines as needed.  Only Scopes with a status of Open or Accepted (if enabled via registry) are eligible for the change. Clearing the Rate Schedule, Margin AND Markup fields (so that none are set) does NOT trigger the recompute.</p>
  <p style="margin-left: 8px;"><img alt="" border="0" src="assets/images/Recompute.bmp" style="border: none;"/> Clicking the Recompute Scope button will recompute the prices based on the Rate Schedule, Gross Margin % or Markup % This button is useful to use if the Rate Schedule has recently been changed.  The button may only be used for Scopes with a status of Open or Accepted (if enabled via registry).</p>

    <p>The Import Flat Rate Wizard supports Inventory Item superceding.
      If an item on the Flat Rate has been superceded, it is automatically

      To import the flat rate without adjusting the hours or quantities,
      or the costs and/or Vendor Id of Inventory or Material lines, click
      the Finish button. The Flat Rate’s Pretax Price (if specified) will

  <p>
    <font style="font-weight: bold;">Hourly Cost:  Extended Cost:</font><br/>
    The hourly cost for this labor defaults from the Flat Rate Category (if selected) or from the Labor Rate/Rate Schedule fields. The system calculates the extended cost by multiplying the Hours times the Hourly Cost.
  </p>
  <p>
    <font style="font-weight: bold;">Hourly Price Extended Price</font><br/>
    If this option is not Fixed Price (which requires that these fields be $0), the hourly cost for this labor defaults from the Labor Rate/Rate Schedule fields or is calculated based on the Cost and Gross Margin or Percent Markup calculations. The system calculates the extended price by multiplying the Hours times the Hourly Price. <span>An extended price of up to $99,999,99 is supported. </span>

  <p style="margin-left: 48px;"><span style="text-indent: -.25in; mso-list: l0 level1 lfo1;">The applicable Cost Method (last, average, standard) is used at the overall level: the quote does not attempt to determine which stocking locations may be utilized in satisfying the inventory needs of the quote.</span></p>

  <p>
    <font style="font-weight: bold;">Unit Price - Extended Price</font><br/>
    If this option is not Fixed Price (which requires that these fields be $0), and this Inventory Item is not flagged as ‘Use Unit Price’, the price for this item is calculated from the Inventory Item/Rate Schedule fields or is calculated based on the Cost and Gross Margin or Percent Markup calculations. <span>The Unit Price will be rounded to 2 decimal places if needed to prevent issues with fractional pennies causing discrepancies between printed quotes and service invoices. The system calculates the extended price by multiplying the Quantity times the Unit Price. An extended price of up to $99,999.99 is supported. </span>
  </p>
  <p>If an Inventory Item flagged as ‘Use Unit Price’ is selected:</p>
  <p style="margin-left: 48px;">If the Quote references a Site (but not a Job), the Site&#39;s Price Level is used<br/>
    If the Quote references a Job, the Job&#39;s Price Level is used<br/>
    When the Job &amp; Site Levels are both blank use the Price Level 1.</p>
  <p style="margin-left: 48px;">
    <font style="font-weight: bold;">Price Code Handling:</font><br/>
    The Inventory Item allows for 10 levels of Material Pricing, but Price Codes only allow for 5. If price codes are in effect, and the default price level from the Client Site is greater than 5, the system now defaults price level 1 from the Price Code. A registry entry <a href="Registry_Entry_Global_Settings__Column_Compression__Dispatch_Board_Rows__History_Log_Inventory_Markup.htm#globel_settings_price_code">Price Code Handling (sys-ffv-global-settings)</a> is available to always default the value from the Price Code level 1, regardless of the Material Price Level in the Client Site.
