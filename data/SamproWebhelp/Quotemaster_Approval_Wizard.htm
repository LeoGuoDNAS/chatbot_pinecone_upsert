  <h1>Quote<span> Manager</span> Approval Wizard</h1>
  <h2>Purpose:</h2>
  <p>This function is invoked when you flag one or more Scopes of a Quote as Approved and then click the Save Record button and/or click the Approval Wizard button. When you do so, the system will automatically steps you through the processes needed to generate (or append to) the Work Orders and Purchase Orders required to implement the work. The Wizard disallows the export of approved lines to closed Work Orders.</p>
  <h2>Usage:</h2>
  <p>
    <font style="font-weight: bold;">PO’s Generated from Quotes:</font> The system compares the net Job History postings from the PO’s Inventory, General and Sub tabs to the Total and Committed Cost values derived from the tabs themselves. A TabHistoryMismatch&#39; alert appears and the PO is not saved if these tests fail. The purchase order’s PO extra flag is set for non-fixed fee quotes.
  </p>
  <p><span>The system checks to see if any Vendors in approved scopes are Inactive, or are Blocked Purchase as of today. If so, the user is alerted and the Wizard is prevented from proceeding.</span></p>
  <p><span style="font-weight: bold;">Job Cost Code&#39;s Cost Category Usage Filter:</span><span>  The validations imposed by the Job Cost Cost&#39;s Cost Category Usage Filter is not supported by the Approval Wizard. If improper Cost Categories are selected, the post will fail. </span></p>
  <p>
    <font style="font-weight: bold;">Error Logging:</font> If a WO or PO fails to be generated, the software displays a message box and writes the errors as .txt files to the directory defined by the dbreportfiles registry entry.
  </p>
  <p>
    <font style="font-weight: bold;">Accounting Periods:</font> An Accounting Period should be flagged as Default if PO’s will be generated. The system:
  </p>
  <p style="margin-left: 36.00pt;">1. Uses the default Accounting Period (if it exists),<br/>
    2. If no default exists, it uses the &#39;first&#39; active accounting period with today&#39;s date in the date range. <br/>
    3. If both of the above fail, the Wizard warns the user, and the PO post fails.</p>
  <p class="Reference_Line" style="margin-bottom: 0.00pt;">
    <font style="font-weight: bold;">Payroll Period:</font>
  </p>
  <p class="Reference_Line" style="margin-bottom: 0.00pt;"><span>Since Payroll Period validation is not applicable to WO Labor flagged as Quoted, the Approval Wizard ignores this validation when generating WO Labor lines.</span></p>
  <p>If <font style="font-weight: bold;">Required Resource</font> processing is enabled, the Quote Approval process is modified so that instead of creating Purchase Orders, a Quote’s Inventory, Other and Subcontractor details write to the Required Resources tab of the Work Order being created/updated. The creation of Purchase Orders or Processing from Inventory will be determined from there by running the RR Wizard.  The system uses the data available in the Quote Detail line (i.e., vendor, cost, etc.) that was selected to populate the Required Resource lines.</p>
  <p><span style="font-weight: bold;">Credit Hold:</span> New Work Orders generated from the Approval Wizard will be put on Credit Hold if the Site or Client is flagged as Credit Hold, or if the Days Credit Hold or Credit Limit in the Client are exceeded, If the Days Credit Hold is blank in the Client this piece of the credit checking is ignored to be in line with New Call processing.</p>
  <p style="margin-left: 8px;">The <span style="font-weight: bold;">Service Evaluation Id</span> defaults from the Scope&#39;s Site Equipment record when a new Work Order is created. For multiple Scopes/Equipment, the Service Evaluation associated with the Equipment on the first Scope processed will be used.</p>
  <p style="margin-left: 8px;"><span style="font-weight: bold;">Client NTE and Sub NTE:</span><span> When a Work Order is created or updated the Work Order&#39;s Sub NTE will be set from the sum of the Extended Costs on the approved Sub Scope lines. The Work Order&#39;s Client NTE will be set from the sum of the Prices and Revenue Adjustments on the approved Scope lines, Registry to <a href="Registry_Entry_to_Warn_if_Cost_Code_Requires_Certified_PR_Reporting.htm#Do_Not_Update_NTE_Amounts_when_Quote_Approval_Wizard_Runs">Prevent Work Order NTE fields from being updated by Approval Wizard</a> may be enabled if this behavior is not desired and SubAnywhere is not in use.</span></p>
  <p><span>The </span><span style="font-weight: bold;">Work Order&#39;s Date Earliest Start</span><span> is set to the current date when a new Work Order is generated from the Quote or Quote Manager&#39;s Approval Wizard. The Work Order&#39;s Date Earliest Start is also set to the current date if the Approval Wizard posts to an existing Work Order whose Date Earliest Start has not yet been set.</span></p>

  <h2>Important Buttons:</h2>
  <p>Each Wizard screen includes buttons on the lower margin.</p>
  <p style="margin-left: 48px;">The <font style="font-weight: bold;">Cancel</font> button should be clicked when to end the approval process.</p>
  <p style="margin-left: 48px;">The <font style="font-weight: bold;">Next</font> button should be clicked to continue the approval process and proceed to the next screen when you have verified that all the options in the current screen have been set correctly.</p>
  <p style="margin-left: 48px;">The <font style="font-weight: bold;">Back</font> button returns you to the previous screen.</p>
  <p style="margin-left: 48px;">The <font style="font-weight: bold;">Finish</font> button is displayed on the final Wizard screen. When you click it, the system will ask you to confirm the posting of lines to your work and purchase orders.</p>
  <h2>Approval Screens:</h2>
  <p>
    <font style="font-weight: bold; text-decoration: underline; ">Approved Option Codes</font>
  </p>
  <p>The purpose of this screen is to confirm the Approved Scopes. All Option Codes are displayed in lower-case text.</p>
  <p style="margin-left: 36.00pt;">
    <font style="font-weight: bold;">OK:</font><br/>
    This field enables you to confirm which options have been approved. By default, all Options that you flagged as approved in the Quotemaster viewer are selected. Double-click on the OK field to deselect an option.
  </p>
  <p style="margin-left: 36.00pt;">
    <font style="font-weight: bold;">Quote Amount: Scope of Services:</font><br/>
    These fields are displayed for informational purposes so that you can verify which options should be approved. The Quote Amount will not be displayed for Fixed Price quotes.
  </p>
  <p style="margin-left: 36.00pt;">
    <font style="font-weight: bold;">Escalation Profile Id:</font><br/>
    This field will be used by the system if a NEW work order is being generated by Quote Master (Export to New WO is selected). This field will not change the existing source work order. This field defaults from the source work order (if referenced in the Quote header) or from the equipment record associated with the last scope.
  </p>
  <p>
    <font style="font-weight: bold; text-decoration: underline; ">Select Work To Do</font>
  </p>
  <p>The purpose of this screen is to determine how to implement the detail for the selected Scope Option(s).</p>
  <p style="margin-left: 36.00pt;">
    <font style="font-weight: bold;">Work To Be Done:</font>
  </p>
  <p style="margin-left: 66.25pt;">
    <font style="font-weight: bold;">Export to WO</font><br/>
    Select this option to append the work to an existing work order (displayed in the field to the right).
  </p>
  <p style="margin-left: 66.25pt;">
    <font style="font-weight: bold;">Export to New WO</font><br/>
    Select this option to create a new work order to record the work. New Work Orders generated by Quote Master will have their Description field set to &#39;Quote: #####&#39;.
  </p>
  <p style="margin-left: 66.25pt;">
    <font style="font-weight: bold;">Create Job Budget:</font><br/>
    <span>When selected, this option will update Job History for the selected Job. Budgeted Revenues and Costs are written for T&amp;M Quotes. The Quote&#39;s Revenue Adjustments also generate a revenue Budget Entry (+ or -) to the Job and Cost Code specified. The </span>data entry forms for this option follow in this order:
  </p>
  <p style="margin-left: 102.25pt;">Default Job Structure:<br/>
    Previously, the Default Job Structure screen information defaulted from the Job Id from the Work Order record. It now uses the new Job Id from the Quote record if it has been entered. </p>
  <p style="margin-left: 102.25pt;">Job Budget Defaults<br/>
    Data from the Job Budget Defaults form is written to the Job Budget tab (and Job History) as budgeted cost.</p>
  <p style="margin-left: 102.25pt;">Billing Defaults (when Scope has Fixed Price)</p>
  <p style="margin-left: 96px;">
    <font style="font-weight: bold;">None of the Above</font><br/>
    If you select this option, the Wizard marks the selected scopes Approved, but does not export any of the detail from your quote to a work order, purchase orders, or job history. A user might wish to use this option to produce a quote, but manually enter the invoicing information to a work order. Once an option has been approved, its status cannot be changed.
  </p>
  <p style="margin-left: 36.00pt;">
    <font style="font-weight: bold;">Workorder Id:</font><br/>
    If a source work order was used to generate the quote, it will be defaulted into this field. If the Export to WO option is selected, the work to be done will be appended to this work order. <span>The Approval Wizard writes to the Work Order Log Tab when a new Work Order is created as well as when a Work Order is updated by the Wizard. </span>
  </p>
  <p style="margin-left: 36.00pt;">
    <font style="font-weight: bold;">Location Id:</font><br/>
    The default parts location for the work order; this field is required if items appear on the Quote’s Inventory tab. This field defaults from the lead work order unless overridden via registry (the sys-viewer-vqte or sys-viewer-vqtemngr locationid option). Note that the Location Id in the wizard is used when generating a new work order - if you write to the lead work order, its location id is not changed or blanked. This Location will also be used for any new PO&#39;s generated by the Wizard.
  </p>
  <p style="margin-left: 36.00pt;">
    <font style="font-weight: bold;">Escalation Profile Id:</font><br/>
    This field will be used by the system if a NEW work order is being generated by Quote Master (Export to New WO is selected). This field will not change the existing source work order. It defaults from the source work order (if referenced in the Quote header) or from the equipment record associated with the first approved scope.
  </p>
  <p style="margin-left: 36.00pt;"><span style="font-weight: bold;">Customer PO#:</span><br/>
    When posting to a New WO, this field will be used to set the PO# field on the Work Order with the PO# provided by the customer. The User is required to enter the Customer PO# number if the PO Required field is flagged in the Site&#39;s Service tab.</p>
  <p style="margin-left: 36.00pt;"><span style="font-weight: bold;">Override Acct Mgr:</span><span> If the Quote&#39;s Client Site specifies a Service Manager, that will default in when New WO has been selected. It will be be used to populate the Work Order&#39;s Service Manager field. The user may also select a different Service Manager for the new Work Order.</span></p>
  <p>
    <font style="font-weight: bold; text-decoration: underline; ">Enter Default Job Structure</font>
  </p>
  <p>The purpose of this screen is to verify, specify or change the job costing records impacted by this quote. The Job information specified here is ALWAYS used when lines are posted to the Work Order / PO when the Wizard is run, regardless of whether or not the DefaultJobByEquipment option is set in the global registry.  </p>

  </p>
  <p class="Reference_Line" style="margin-left: 36.00pt; margin-bottom: 0.00pt;">
    <font style="font-weight: bold;">Cost Category:</font><br/>
    This display-only field defaults from the quote.
  </p>
  <p>
    <font style="font-weight: bold;">Note on Duplicate Lines for Multiple Options:</font><br/>
    If duplicate lines are entered for 2 options, they are both written to the same cost code / billing item (the first selected in the Quote Approval Wizard screen). The criteria is type (Labor, inventory, material, other, subcontractor) and description. This functionality enables the consolidation of duplicate lines on purchase orders.
  </p>
  <p class="Reference_Line" style="margin-bottom: 0.00pt;">
    <font style="font-weight: bold; 
	 text-decoration: underline; ">Verify Tech Lines</font>
  </p>
  <p class="Reference_Line" style="margin-left: 36.00pt; margin-bottom: 0.00pt;">
    <font style="font-weight: bold;">Tech Id:  Log Type: Est. Hrs. Date Scheduled: Time Scheduled:</font><br/>
    Technician Lines appear in the Wizard according to the following rules:
  </p>
  <p style="margin-left: 56px;">1. When Export to Existing WO is selected, the existing tech lines from the source work order are shown, plus any new lines added for Subcontractor Techs generated from the Subcontractor tab; the WO Display field will display the source work order id followed by a asterisk * for these new lines.</p>
  <p style="margin-left: 56px;">2. When Export to New WO is selected, a &#39;new&#39; WO Tech line is included in the wizard and is ALWAYS posted to the new work order, along with any lines added for Subcontractor Techs generated from the Subcontractor tab. These lines will be indicated as ‘New’ in the WO Display field.</p>
  <p style="margin-left: 56px;">The Wizard also displays lines from the original source work order: the Work Order Id will appear in the WO Display field. They may be edited by the user. In this release, edits to the Time Scheduled for existing lines will successfully update the source work order.</p>
  <p style="margin-left: 88px;">
    <font style="font-weight: bold;">Note:</font> If the Verify Tech Lines box is NOT displayed, the work order log type on the Tech tab will be set to Quote Approved for all lines EXCEPT as specified in the AutoUpdateWOTechStatusIgnore registry option. If this option is not enabled, the default is for the Quote Approval Wizard to not update WO Tech lines set to &#39;credit hold&#39;,&#39;tech declined&#39;, or &#39;cancelled&#39;.
  </p>
  <p style="margin-left: 36.00pt;">
    <font style="font-weight: bold;">WO</font>
    <font style="font-weight: bold;">Display:</font><br/>
    If the Quote is being written to a new Work Order, the designation ‘New’ will appear in the WO Id column. Lines for the original source Work Order will also appear, and may be updated by the user if needed.
  </p>
  <p>
    <font style="font-weight: bold; text-decoration: underline; ">Verify Purchase Order Lines</font>
  </p>
  <p class="Reference_Line" style="margin-bottom: 0.00pt;">If you entered a Vendor Id on any of the Inventory, Material, Sub or Other lines, this Wizard screen will able you to verify the PO lines to be posted.</p>
  <p class="Reference_Line">If the Date Closed is set on a Purchase Order, user is warned that &quot;The following Purchase Orders are closed and cannot be updated&quot;.  After clearing this message, the user has the option of proceeding or canceling the Wizard (so that the PO referenced in the Quote may be changed or cleared before rerunning the Wizard). Canceling the Wizard and correcting the problem is recommended. If the user elected to continue and the post to the PO failed, the user will be warned, and a text file (ErrorLogForQuote_######_date_time) specifying the problem will be written to the directory named in the dbreportfiles registry.</p>
  <p class="Reference_Line" style="margin-bottom: 0.00pt;">If lines are being written to a PO that has an inactive Accounting Period, change the period in the PO to the default Accounting Period and change the PO Date Released to the current system date.</p>
  <p style="margin-left: 36.00pt;">
    <font style="font-weight: bold;">OK:</font><br/>
    This field enables you to confirm which lines to post. By default, all the detail for all options that you flagged as approved in the Quotemaster viewer are selected. Double-click on the OK field to deselect an option.
  </p>
  <p style="margin-left: 36.00pt;">
    <font style="font-weight: bold;">Vendor Name: Quantity: Description: Extended Cost: PO Id:</font><br/>
    These informational fields are based on information that you entered in the QuoteMaster record.
  </p>
  <p style="margin-left: 36.00pt;">
    <font style="font-weight: bold;">StockLocation WorkSite Service Provider</font><br/>
    These options enable you to choose where the items should be shipped. Note that if the user changes the default Shipping Location, the system always uses the Shipping Location selected on the first line.
  </p>
  <p style="margin-left: 36.00pt;">By default, StockLocation is selected: the Vendor will ship items to the Location address selected in the first Wizard screen.</p>
  <p style="margin-left: 36.00pt;">If you select WorkSite, the shipping address on the PO will be set to the Site’s shipping address.</p>
  <p style="margin-left: 36.00pt;">If you select Service Provider, the items will ship to the Technician/Subcontractor noted in the first line of the Technician tab of the generated work order.</p>
