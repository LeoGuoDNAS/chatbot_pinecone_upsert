 <P><FONT style="font-weight:bold; " >Revised Reports:</FONT></P>
 <P style="margin-left:36.00pt;"><FONT style="font-weight:bold; " >Report W2 Electronic File:</FONT> The Audit Report option of Report W2 Electronic File (report RW2EF.rpt dated 2/21/2012) has been modified so that the totals row is offset so that larger payroll amounts do not overlap. <FONT style="font-weight:bold; " >In addition, a new registry option is REQUIRED for federal process</FONT><FONT style="font-weight:bold; " >ing</FONT><FONT style="font-weight:bold; " >.

 <P style="margin-left:36.00pt;"><FONT style="font-weight:bold; " >Drill Down AP Aging:</FONT> The updated report (DAPVAGEv73b033.rpt dated 2/28/2012) corrects a problem that only occurred if you ran this report with the Invoice Detail option set to Yes. Previously, this resulted in the associated drill-down displaying the incorrect Vendor Name.  </P>
 <P style="margin-left:36.00pt;"><FONT style="font-weight:bold; " >Revised Report: Service Invoice:  </FONT>Certain custom formats specify that the work requested / performed is suppressed. Previously, if these formats were included in a service compute run with (for example) FORMAT_11 formats, the suppression was not turned off for the FORMAT_11 lines, resulting in the Work Requested not printing when it should. The service invoice (serviceinvoicev73b032.rpt) report dated 2/13/2011 corrects this problem. </P>
 <H2>8.0.509.010</H2>
 <P><FONT style="font-weight:bold; " >Dispatch Board:</FONT> Previously, the Description field on Work Order List defaulted from the Work Order Name.

 <P><FONT style="font-weight:bold; " >CRM Anywhere:</FONT> Previously, if the option disablecrmmanagequotes was set to true in the web-settings registry to remove the Manage Quotes page, the Quote table was also suppressed in the Site View page.
