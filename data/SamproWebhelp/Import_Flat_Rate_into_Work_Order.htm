<h1>Importing a Flat Rate into a Work Order</h1>
<h2>Purpose:</h2>
<p>Enables the user to enter the cost and revenue components of a flat rate category into a work order.</p>
<p>In previous releases, the Equipment was left blank in the Labor, Inventory, and Other tabs when importing FLAT RATES into the work order (via the Flat Rate button).  The system now defaults in the Equipment Id from the first line of the Equipment tab.</p>
<p>If an item on the Flat Rate has been superceded, it will be automatically replaced by the current part during the import.  </p>
<h2>Usage:</h2>
<p><font style="font-weight: bold;">Important Note:</font> If you have entered any Labor, Inventory or Other lines manually, be sure to save the Work Order before importing a Flat Rate. If you do not save the Work Order before importing the Flat Rate, any detail lines that you may have entered prior to the import will be lost.</p>
<p>SAM Pro supports Flat Rate quantities other than whole numbers to prevent a conflict with TechAnywhere.</p>
<p><img src="assets/images/image/SKIN1_Import_Flat_Rate.gif" alt="" style="border: none;" border="0"/>  When the Flat Rate button on the top button bar of the Work Order viewer is clicked, the system displays a data-entry screen that enables you to select the Quantity, Flat Rate Category, Effective (work) Date, Technician, and Flat Rate Price level. After entering this information (as described below), the user would then click the OK button.</p>
<p>The flat rate information will be entered into the work order detail tabs as follows:</p>
<p style="margin-left: 36.00pt;"><font style="font-weight: bold;">If Required Resources are NOT Enabled:</font></p>
<p style="margin-left: 36.00pt;">The labor estimated hours and costs will be entered into the Labor tab with a revenue amount of zero.</p>
<p style="margin-left: 36.00pt;">If the cost of Inventory Materials is set to 0 in the Flat Rate, the cost is defaulted on import based on the rules specified in the Inventory record. If a Technician is specified in the Import, costing will be based on the default location for that Technician. If a Technician is not specified, the Location will not be defaulted, and overall costing for that item will be used.</p>
<p style="margin-left: 36.00pt;">Non-inventory material costs will be entered on the Other tab with a revenue rate of zero.</p>
<p style="margin-left: 36.00pt;">Pricing (revenue) entries will be made to the Other tab. These entries will be imported with a cost of zero. Typically, two revenue entries will be made:</p>
<p style="margin-left: 72.00pt;">One entry with a sales tax type of &quot;sales&quot; for materials (with the revenue amount defaulting from the Taxable Amount in the Flat Rate record for the selected price level).</p>
<p style="margin-left: 72.00pt;">Another entry with a sales tax type of &quot;n/a&quot; for labor and other non-taxable charges (the system computes the revenue amount by subtracting the Taxable Amount from the Pretax Price in the Flat Rate record for the selected price level). When the invoice is computed, the sales tax will be computed by the system based on the taxable revenue amount and the Sales Tax Group specified in the Job record.</p>
<p style="margin-left: 36.00pt;"><font style="font-weight: bold;">If Required Resources IS Enabled:</font></p>
<p style="margin-left: 66.25pt;">See the description for the ‘WO Req’d Resource?’ field – you have the option to import the Flat Rate to the Required Resource tab.</p>
<p><font style="font-weight: bold;">Technician and Default Location</font><br/>
When a Flat Rate is imported into a Work Order, the Location (in the Inventory tab and the Work Order main screen) is handled as follows:</p>
<p style="margin-left: 48px;">If a Technician Id is specified in the Flat Rate import and the Technician record specifies a Location Id, the Location Id in the Work Order main screen is set to the Location Id in the Technician record. In addition, all Inventory tab entries created as a result of the Flat Rate import will include the Location Id that defaulted from the Technician record.</p>
<p style="margin-left: 48px;">If a Technician Id is specified in the Flat Rate import, but the Technician record does not specify a Location Id, the system will use the Location Id in the Work Order main screen to set the Location Id for all Inventory tab entries created as a result of the Flat Rate import.</p>
<p style="margin-left: 48px;">If a Technician Id is not specified in the Flat Rate import, the system will use the Location Id in the Work Order main screen to set the Location Id for all Inventory tab entries created as a result of the Flat Rate import.</p>
<h2>Important Fields:</h2>
<p><font style="font-weight: bold;">Note:</font> After completing the following fields, click the OK button to import the selected flat rate. Be sure to specify an accounting period for the INV Inventory tab entry (entries) and a Payroll Period in the Labor tab before saving the record.</p>
<p><font style="font-weight: bold;">Flat Rate Id:</font><br/>
Enter a valid Flat Rate Id or double-click on this field to select from a list of Flat Rates.</p>
<p><font style="font-weight: bold;">Level</font> (1 numeric)<br/>
Enter the flat rate pricing level (1-9) to be used for setting the default prices. Note that not all flat rate pricing services support 9 levels of pricing.</p>
<p><font style="font-weight: bold;">Quantity:</font><br/>
Enter the quantity of this flat rate category to be billed on this work order (typically, 1).</p>
<p><font style="font-weight: bold;">Date:</font> <br/>
The effective date (the date the work was done). You may enter the date in <font style="font-style: italic;">mmddyyyy</font> format, press the Spacebar to enter today&#39;s date, or double-click on this field to access a Calendar.</p>
<p><font style="font-weight: bold;">Technician Id:</font><br/>
This field defaults from the field line of the TEC tab (if a technician is specified). You may enter the Id of the technician doing the labor or double click to select from a list.</p>
<p><font style="font-weight: bold;">WO Req’d Resource?<br/></font>This field will only appear if Required Resource processing is implemented on your system. By default, this box is checked: clicking OK will result in Flat Rate Inventory and Materials being imported to the Required Resource tab. Clearing this field will result in Flat Rate Inventory and Materials being imported to the Inventory and Other tabs. Labor will be imported to the Labor tab in either case.</p>
<p>If a Flat Rate is imported (with Required Resource processing enabled), the Date on the Flat Import window will be used to set the Date Required on the Required Resource tab. If an inventory item is on the flat rate, the Description is now set from the Inventory Item Name. </p>
