  <h1>User Account Viewer</h1>
  <h2>Purpose:</h2>
  <p>Maintains user record, password and security information. If filled in, the security table in the lower section of the screen enables the user to switch their branch security levels (and, optionally their user group) without logging in under a different id. This feature is useful for administrators logging on to maintain branch data.</p>
  <h2>Licensing Considerations and Active Users:</h2>
  <p>This release changes the way in which ‘Active’ users of specific type are counted. Previously, when counting active users for licensing purposes, the system only looked at users whose ‘Disabled’ field was clear (set to No). In this release, active users are those whose Disabled field is clear AND whose Password Expiration Date is either blank (1900-01-01) or set to a future date. This brings the licensing calculations in line with the users that are displayed as active in the list.</p>
  <p>In general a User Id should NOT be changed if, for example, one SAMPro user was being replaced by another.  The preferred method of handling the user record if one user will be replacing another is to first disable one user record (for the old user) and then create a new record for the new user.</p>
  <h2>Usage:</h2>
  <p>Required to log onto SAMPro, DBAnalytics and TimeAnywhere.</p>
  <p>Referenced in Journals: A user, date and time stamp is maintained by the system for manual journal entries.</p>
  <h2>Registry:</h2>
  <p>See <a href="Registry_Entry_Global_Settings__Column_Compression__Dispatch_Board_Rows__History_Log_Inventory_Markup.htm#Global_Settings_Security_Override">Global Setting Security Override</a> to set the security of work orders and other records according the security of the Job, not the user.</p>
  <p style="margin-left: 8px;">See <a href="Registry_Security_Overrides.htm">Block Users from Seeing Records with Specific Security</a> for a registry to limit user&#39;s access to specific companies by Security (Intercompany installations).</p>
  <h2>Example:</h2>
  <p>Create a new user on the system, change a password expiration date.</p>
  <h2>Important Fields: Upper Section</h2>
  <p class="Tab">Main Tab</p>
  <p>
    <font style="font-weight: bold;">User Id:</font><br/>
    A unique id for this user. This field is required. Spaces should NOT be included in User Id&#39;s.
  </p>
  <p>
    <font style="font-weight: bold;">User Name:</font><br/>
    The name of the user; this field is optional but recommended.
  </p>
  <p>
    <font style="font-weight: bold;">Disabled?</font><br/>
    If this field is flagged, the user will be unable to log onto the Data-Basics&#39; software. Double-click on this field (or press the Spacebar) to flag/clear it.
  </p>
  <p>If a user flags this field and the AND the User Account being disabled has active sessions a warning that  &#39;Active Sessions for this User will be terminated&#39; will be displayed. The system will terminate all active sessions when a User Account is disabled and the record is saved.  </p>
  <p style="margin-left: 48px;"><span style="font-weight: bold;">Note:</span> If the user being disabled has unsaved changes it may be difficult for them to exit SAMPro; we recommend that you contact the user and instruct them to exit SAMPro. The UserLogonSummary tab should be used to determine if the selected User is active.</p>
  <p>
    <font style="font-weight: bold;">New Password:  Confirm Password:</font> (10 character)<br/>
    Use these fields to enter and confirm a new/changed password for this user. The password does not display in either of these fields for security purposes. <font style="font-weight: bold;">After a user record has been created, the user should log on as soon as possible and change his or her password to maintain system security.</font>
  </p>
  <p>
    <font style="font-weight: bold;">Report Password:  Confirm Report Password:</font> (10 character)<br/>
    Use these fields to enter and confirm a new/changed Access report password for this user. This field must be completed even if the user will not be running Access reports. The password does not display in either of these fields for security purposes.
  </p>
  <p><img alt="" border="0" src="assets/images/image/SKIN1_Change_Password.gif" style="border: none;"/> Each user may reset his/her password by clicking the Password button on the Top Button bar, entering and confirming the password, and clicking OK.</p>
  <p>
    <font style="font-weight: bold;">Access Type: Full - Read Only -  Remote</font> - <font style="font-weight: bold;">Special</font><br/>
    This field defines this user record for licensing purposes. The system compares the number of active users of this type with the number of users that you have licenses for when you create or change a user record. The Access type of Remote is used for TimeAnywhere (users must have an Access Type of Full or Remote).
  </p>
  <p>User with Access Type &#39;ReadOnly&#39; are prohibited from executing any Starter Function.</p>
  <p>The type of Special is designed for support and agent log on’s so that the count of user’s purchased licenses can be maintained more accurately. A master log in is required to create or edit this type of user.</p>
  
  <p></p>
  <p>
    <font style="font-weight: bold;">Credit Manager?</font><br/>
    If this user is a credit manager that is allowed to implement credit overrides the Work Order or COP Order, flag this field by double-clicking on it (or pressing the Spacebar). To implement credit overrides for only COP or only Work Orders, see <a href="User_Registry_Entries.htm">User Registry Entries</a>.
  </p>
  <p>
    <font style="font-weight: bold;">Purchasing Agent</font><br/>
    A User must be flagged as a Purchasing Agent to save a released, changed, or printed PO. Users without this authority can only save Unreleased PO&#39;s.
  </p>
  <p>
    <font style="font-weight: bold;">Drop Ship Agent:</font><br/>
    Check this box (by pressing the spacebar or double-click it) if this user is authorized to flag Client Orders for drop shipment.
  </p>
  <p>
    <font style="font-weight: bold;">Executive P/R?</font><br/>
    This field has been added to both the User and Employee records.  By definition:
  </p>
  <p style="margin-left: 23.75pt;">An Executive P/R Employee is only accessible by an Executive P/R User.</p>
  <p style="margin-left: 23.75pt;">The Executive Payroll check box in an Employee record may only be set or cleared by a user with the Executive Payroll box checked in their user record</p>
  <p style="margin-left: 23.75pt;">An Executive P/R User has full access to ALL employees.</p>
  <p class="Reference_Line" style="margin-bottom: 0.00pt;">Executive Payroll enter/edit restrictions have been applied so that users without the Executive Payroll flag will not be able to access entries for Executive Payroll Employees in the Labor Journal, PR Journal and Job Journal as well as many reports. See <a href="Executive_Payroll.htm">Executive Payroll</a> for details.</p>
  <p>
    <font style="font-weight: bold;">Notes Administrator?</font><br/>
    Checking this field designates the user as a notes administrator that will override the ownership security on record notes. Any user designated as a Notes Administrator will be able to change or delete ANY public or private note record note even if it is marked private and the user is not the owner.
  </p>
  <p>Notes Administrators are also allowed to delete Global Ranges created by other users. Previously, named global ranges (prefixed by a *) for viewers and reports could only be deleted by the user that created them. If that user left the firm, the range could not be deleted. In this release, users flagged as a Notes Administrator may delete global ranges defined by other users. Note that ranges are deleted by double-clicking and answering Yes to Remove Selected Range prompt.</p>
  <p style="font-weight: bold;">Time Entry Admin?<br/>
    <span style="font-weight: normal;">This field is not currently supported.</span>

  <p><img alt="image\CloneProfile.gif" border="0" height="28" src="assets/images/image/CloneProfile.gif" title="image\CloneProfile.gif" width="72"/></p>
  <p>If several users will be employing the same or similar DB Analytics, the Clone Profile button on the User record (scroll down the parent to access this button) may be used to clone the settings from a selected user who already has them set up.</p>
  <p><img alt="image\ResetProfile.gif" border="0" height="28" src="assets/images/image/ResetProfile.gif" title="image\ResetProfile.gif" width="72"/></p>
  <p>The Reset Profile button should only be used to clear a user’s DB Analytic configuration if there is a problem accessing it.</p>
  <p><img alt="image\ExportProfile.gif" border="0" height="28" src="assets/images/image/ExportProfile.gif" title="image\ExportProfile.gif" width="72"/><br/>
    ’Scroll down the parent screen to access this button; it is designed to be used with DBAnalytics. This button enables you to export the User Profile (KPIs, Tab Groups and Tabs), for this user as an object (.obj) file. This object file may then be imported to provide a preset profile for other users. For example, a support person could use this file to expedite user setups for a new installation.</p>
  <p><span>The Export Function no longer exports any KPis that are set to Active: False, or Shared. Only active:true KPI&#39;s are exported.  Clicking this button exports the User&#39;s Profile to the DashboardProfiles folder in the main SAMPro directory.  This folder will be created if it does not exist.  </span></p>
  <p>The file will use the naming convention exported_DBAnalyticsFrom_databasename_For_userid.obj.</p>
  <p class="Support" style="margin-left: 48px;"> </p>
  <p><img alt="image\ImportProfile.gif" border="0" height="28" src="assets/images/image/ImportProfile.gif" title="image\ImportProfile.gif" width="72"/><br/>
    Scroll down the parent screen to access this button; it is designed to be used with DBAnylytics. This button enables you to import a Profile (KPI’s, Tab Groups and Tabs) from an object (.obj) file. For example, a support person could use this file to expedite user setups for a new installation. <span>The Import Function only imports Active:True KPI&#39;s.</span></p>
  <p>When you click this button, a selection box will appear allowing you to choose from the appropriate objects located in the main SAM Pro directory. Click on a file to select it, and then click Select to import the DBAnalytics profile, or Cancel to cancel the operation. When the user next logs into DBAnalytics, the imported profile will be installed.</p>
  <p>
    <font style="font-weight: bold;">Password Expiration:</font> (date format mmddyyyy)<br/>
    The date on which this password expires. If a user attempts to login after this date, a message that this user/password are invalid will be displayed. record. <font style="font-weight: bold;">Note:</font> if you are not implementing this security feature, be sure to leave this field blank (set to the default value of 01/01/1900).
  </p>
  <p>
    <font style="font-weight: bold;">Password Renewal:</font> (date format mmddyyyy)<br/>
    This field specifies the date by which this user must enter a new password. It should be initialized (e.g., to today&#39;s date, or a week from today) if the Password Days field is set in the User Group/User Group Functions record. When the user enters a new password, this field will automatically be updated to the current date plus the number of Password Days specified in the User Group record. <font style="font-weight: bold;">Note:</font> if you are not implementing this security feature, be sure to leave this field blank (set to the default value of 01/01/1900).
  </p>
  <p>
    <font style="font-weight: bold;">Failed Login Attempts:</font><br/>
    This field is a counter that registers the number of times this user has entered his password incorrectly at the login. If this number exceeds the Max Failed Login Attempts field in the User Group record, the user will be unable to login until this counter is reset to zero (or a number less than Max Failed Login Attempts). This field is reset to 0 when a user logs in successfully.
  </p>
  <p>
    <font style="font-weight: bold;">Group Id:</font><br/>
    A valid User Group Id. Double-click on this field to select from a list of Group Id&#39;s. The User Group controls the User&#39;s access to records, reports and functions.

  <p>
    <font style="font-weight: bold;">PM Reporting Filter:</font><br/>
    If this user is a project manager, this field may be used to limit reporting information to only those project manager id(s) listed in this field. Note that a report must include the Project Manager key for this feature to be implemented. If completed, this range also limits a user’s access to only those project manager-related records (e.g., jobs) included in this filter. If this field is blank and this user has access to the Project Manager viewer, he or she will be able access any project manager viewer in the system.
  </p>
  <p>Version 9.0 and above also applies the User&#39;s PM filtering to the Work Order viewer. The Project Manager is connected to the Work Order via the Work Order&#39;s parent Job.  A list option, Work Orders By Project Manager Id supports this enhancement.</p>
  <p style="font-weight: bold;"><span>Sql= Support: </span><span style="font-weight: normal;">This range provides full support of the various options available on a typical range screen, include sql= specifications.</span></p>
  <p style="margin-left: 36.00pt;">
    <font style="font-weight: bold; text-decoration: underline; ">Example:</font>
  </p>
  <p style="margin-left: 88px;">Suppose this user is a project principal, with project managers BSMITH,JCONNER and KFEIN working under him. In this case, the Project Manager Reporting Filter would be filled in as follows:</p>
  <p style="margin-left: 88px;"> <font style="font-weight: bold;">BSMITH,JCONNER,KFEIN</font>
  </p>
  <p style="margin-left: 88px;">If this user is a project manager, filling in just his Project Manager Id would automatically filter reports to the projects he manages.</p>
  <p>
    <font style="font-weight: bold;">Discipline Filter:</font><br/>
    This field may be used to limit job reporting information to only those Disciplines listed in this field. Note that a report must include the Discipline key for this feature to be implemented. Data-Basics’ standard job cost reports include this key.
  </p>
  <p>
    <font style="font-weight: bold;">Location Filter:</font><br/>
    In the Back Orders Fill functions for COP and Shop Orders, the back orders are initially listed only for the Location Id’s listed in this field. If the user&#39;s Location Filter is blank, the system will take the initial location from the user&#39;s Location Id field as before.
  </p>
  <p><span style="font-weight: bold;">Sales Rep Filter:</span><br/>
    This filter range is intended for use with custom analytics, and must be referenced in the KPI to filter certain analytic data by sales Rep Id.</p>
  <p> </p>
  <p class="Tab">Other Tab</p>
  <p><span style="font-weight: bold;">User Security 1-3:</span><br/>
    These fields are designed for use with certain custom analytics (KPI&#39;s). They are not currently referenced by the SAMPro code.</p>

	 border-right: 1.50pt solid #000000;">Additional Profiles Tab</p>
  <p>If filled in, this table enables the user to switch their security levels (and, optionally their user group) without logging in under a different id. This feature is useful for administrators logging on to maintain branch data. Switching Security Identities builds a new function list that is determined by the User Group from the selected Security Identity plus each of the Additional User Groups.</p>
  <p>When the user logs on, their security level will be as defined in the main (upper) section of the User record. If their security table is empty, the user will not be able to switch security. If their security table contains one or more lines, they will be able to switch to one of the alternate securities listed in their table. The Switch Security Identity function may be accessed from the Special tab of the Folders viewer.</p>
  <p>Alternately, you may do so from the menu by selecting:</p>
  <p>Functions &gt;  Special &gt;  Switch Security Identity</p>
  <p>Next, the system will display a box listing the alternative securities available for this user; simply click on the desired security to log on. The user&#39;s current security id will appear in the title bar of the Data-Basics windows.</p>
  <p>
    <font style="font-weight: bold;">Security Id:</font><br/>
    Enter an alternate Security Id for this user or double-click on this field to select from a list.
  </p>
  <p>In Version 9.0 and above, multiple lines may be entered per Security Id to support access to multiple User Groups (in addition to the Additional Groups tab)  when the user switches to the specified Security.</p>
  <p style="margin-left: 48px; text-decoration: underline; ">Example:</p>
  <p style="margin-left: 48px;">User Header:</p>

    Switching Security Identities builds a new function list that is determined by the User Group from the selected Security Identity plus each of the Additional User Groups. <span>If this field is left blank, the Group Id from the Main tab will be used when switching security. </span>
  </p>
  <p>
    <font style="font-weight: bold;">Branch Id:</font><br/>
    If this field is completed, the user’s branch membership will also be changed when the user switches his/her security.

  <p>This tab enables users to belong to other Users Groups in addition to the primary one specified in the upper portion of this viewer. The Group Id in the parent determines the password settings used during the login process. After the initial login, the available functions are determined by the parent User Group <font style="text-decoration: underline; ">plus</font> each of the Additional User Groups.</p>

  <p style="margin-left: 36.00pt;">
    <font style="font-weight: bold;">Important Note:</font> for report scheduling purposes where a User Group is specified, the system only considers the primary (header) User Group Id referenced in the User record.
