  <h1>Purchase Order Viewer</h1>
  <h2>Purpose:</h2>
  <p>Create, change, and cancel Purchase and Change orders. The term &quot;PO&quot; will be used to refer to both purchase and change orders. Receipts (whether received to the PO or the Inventory Receipts journal) post to Job History so these costs can be billed <font style="font-style: italic;">before</font> you receive the vendor’s invoice. Freight and adjustments will be written to Job History when the Vendor’s invoice is vouchered in the AP Journal.</p>
  <h2>Usage:</h2>
  <p class="Reference_Line" style="margin-bottom: 0.00pt;">Click to see the <a class="dropspot" data-rhwidget="DropSpot" data-target="POPUP689791554" href="#"><span data-open-text="true" data-skip-index="true">rules which apply to Purchase Orders</span><span data-close-text="true">rules which apply to Purchase Orders</span></a>.</p>
  <div data-targetname="POPUP689791554">
    <p>1. A PO cannot be deleted; it can only be cancelled. Once a PO line
      has been checked as Cancelled, the system disallows changes to all
      fields except the &#39;Cancel?&#39; option.<br/>
      2. A PO Line can only be deleted if the item it specifies has not yet
      been received.<br/>
      3. A PO Line cannot be changed once it has a status of Cancelled.<br/>
      4. The PO denies the use of credit-hold WOs; a user with Credit Manager
      privileges must remove the Credit Hold flag from the Work Order. PO’s
      will be automatically be generated for Subcontractor Technicians but
      may not be edited until the WO is taken off Credit Hold.<br/>
      5. A user must be flagged as a Purchasing Agent (in the User record)
      to save a released PO. Users without this authority may only save
      Unreleased PO&#39;s.<br/>
      6. A setting on the User’s registry tab may be used to limited the
      dollar amount of PO’s released by the user (see <a href="User_Registry_Entries.htm">User
        Registry Entries</a> ). A User (Purchase Agent) with a higher limit
      can edit and release the PO in this situation.<br/>
      7. The dollar amount may also be limited by the PO Limit per WO in
      the Vendor record. </p>
  </div>
  <p>See <a href="Start_Close_Open_POs.htm">Start Close Open POs</a> or <a href="Start_Close_Completed_Purchase_Orders.htm">Start Close Completed Purchase Orders</a> for automated help in closing Purchase Orders.</p>
  <p style="margin-left: 8px;"><span style="font-weight: bold;">Equipment Flagged Deny TA Access?</span><br/>
    If a SAMPro user creates a purchase order for a TechAnywhere Tech work order, they may inadvertently pick equipment that is flagged Deny TA Access. <a class="dropspot" data-rhwidget="DropSpot" data-target="POPUP689594423" href="#"><span data-open-text="true" data-skip-index="true">See details.</span><span data-close-text="true">See details.</span></a></p>
  <div data-targetname="POPUP689594423">
    <p>In this case, the parts from the purchase order will never come
      into TechAnywhere and the tech ends up manually entering the parts
      again and double costing the job.  The system displays a warning
      when adding lines to a purchase order when the equipment chosen has
      the Deny TA Access? flag checked.</p>

    <p>The Vendor Id may only be changed or set by the user if the Purchase
      Order Status is Unreleased or Released, and no items have yet been
      received. Validation prevents changing the Vendor ID when un-reversed
      AP Journal transactions exist. The Vendor Id may be changed on un-received
      PO&#39;s generated from the WO Required Resource lines via the Required
      Resource Wizard. Changing the PO also updates the Work Order&#39;s Required
      Resource line(s) with the new Vendor&#39;s Id.</p>
    <p>For Purchase Orders generated from Quotes, the Vendor can be changed
      if no receipts have been performed and it is NOT a Subcontractor PO.  </p>

    This field is displayed from the Vendor record. If this field is checked, AND the PO&#39;s Header Job/Work Order&#39;s Job also requires Lien Waivers, this PO will require Lien Waivers. <a href="Lien_Waiver_Overview.htm">See Lien Waiver Overview</a>.</p>

If Intercompany is enabled you will need to select the Location. </span>
  </p>
  <p style="margin-left: 48px;"><span style="font-weight: bold;">Note:</span> This default behavior will be impacted if the StickyBySecurityId registry is enabled for the PO record, or if this field is set to not be sticky via customization.</p>
  <p>
    <font style="font-weight: bold;">Period Id:</font><br/>
    If items are received in the Purchase Order (by completing the Quantity Received field), then the Accounting Period must be completed to ensure proper inventory management transactions (for example, if the PO was being used to record the prior purchase of miscellaneous materials). If the PO Inventory Receipts Journal is used to receive items, the Accounting Period field in the Purchase Order does not need to be completed.
  </p>
  <p style="margin-left: 36.00pt;">
    <font style="font-weight: bold;">When Unvouchered Payables is Enabled in the Accounting Period</font><br/>
    The Unvouchered AP option in the Accounting Period is deprecated in favor of the <a href="Create_EOM_Unvouchered_AP_GL_Entries.htm">Create EOM Unvouchered AP GL Entries</a> function. However, if your firm is still using the Unvouchered Payables option in the accounting period, click to see t<a class="dropspot" data-rhwidget="DropSpot" data-target="POPUP793430300" href="#"><span data-open-text="true" data-skip-index="true">he guidelines which must be observed</span><span data-close-text="true">he guidelines which must be observed</span></a>.
  </p>
  <div data-targetname="POPUP793430300">
    <p style="margin-left: 36.00pt;">Since G/L entries are posting at the
      time of P.O. Receipt, it is important that the P.O. is vouchered in
      A/P with information that consistently reflects what the P.O. was
      at the time of receipt. To ensure that this is the case, system validations
      enforce the following procedures.<br/>
      <br/>
      1. A P.O. Line may not be changed once receipts have occurred for the
      item on the line. Edits may be done to lines that have not had receipt
      transactions recorded to them.
    </p>
    <p style="margin-left: 36.00pt;">2. If an A/P invoice reflects pricing
      that is different from the P.O the edit should be performed in the
      A/P Journal at the time of vouchering. The postings for such edits
      is properly handled by the A/P Journal.</p>
    <p style="margin-left: 36.00pt;">3. If it is determined that received
      items were ordered to an incorrect G/L account this edit should also
      occur in the A/P Journal. The procedure to this edit will be to:<br/>
      - Import the P.O. to the A/P Journal<br/>
      - ACCEPT the G/L value from the P.O.<br/>
      - ADD the transactions, then edit the G/L Account and <font style="font-family: Tahoma;" face="Tahoma"><br/>
      </font> - SAVE the edited transaction</p>
    <p style="margin-left: 36.00pt;">4. In cases where the P.O. MUST be
      changed, the receipt transaction may be &quot;undone&quot; prior to
      editing the P.O. Line as long as no A/P transactions <font style="font-family: Tahoma;" face="Tahoma">have been recorded for the item.</font>
    </p>
    <p style="margin-left: 36.00pt;">
      <font style="font-family: Tahoma;" face="Tahoma">5. T</font>he
      PO will allow postings to the blank GL Account for unvouchered payable

    </p>
  </div>
  <p>
    <font style="font-weight: bold;">Requested:</font><br/>
    The date you are requesting the items.
  </p>
  <p>
    <font style="font-weight: bold;">Promised:</font><br/>
    The date the vendor promised to deliver the items; this field defaults from the Date Requested, but may be changed by the user.
  </p>
  <p>
    <font style="font-weight: bold;">Confirming?</font><br/>
    Flag this field if you have placed the PO verbally and a printed PO will only confirm the verbal order. Double-click to flag or blank this field. This field is &quot;sticky&quot;: its setting will be retained when you create a new PO.
  </p>
  <p>
    <font style="font-weight: bold;">Acknowledgement?</font><br/>
    Flag this field if you require an acknowledgement of receipt from the Vendor. Double-click on this field (or press Spacebar) to flag or blank this field. This field is &quot;sticky&quot;: its setting will be retained when you create a new PO.
  </p>
  <p>
    <font style="font-weight: bold;">Drop Ship:</font><br/>
    This informational box will be checked if this Purchase Order was generated to fulfill a Client Order drop shipment from the vendor to the client. The Shipping Address will be set to the Site’s shipping address.
  </p>
  <p>
    <font style="font-weight: bold;">Order Id:</font><br/>
    If this Purchase Order was generated to fulfill a Client Order drop shipment, the Client Order Id will appear in this display-only field.
  </p>
  <p>
    <font style="font-weight: bold;">Insurance Required: Insurance Expired:</font><br/>
    These display-only fields are typically used in conjunction with subcontractor control. The insurance required field defaults from the Insurance Required field in the Vendor record. If this field is checked, the system will check the INS tab in the Vendor record to determine if the insurance is still valid. If not, the Insurance Expired field will also be checked.
  </p>
  <p><span style="font-weight: bold;">Payments Blocked:</span><br/>
    If this display field is checked, the Vendor’s required Insurance is currently expired, and payments will be blocked in AP. Today’s date is compared with the Start and End Dates on the Vendor&#39;s Insurance tab to determine if the Insurance is expired.</p>
  <p>
    <font style="font-weight: bold;">Purchases</font>
    <font style="font-weight: bold;">Blocked:</font><br/>
    If this field is flagged, and the Vendor’s required Insurance is expired, a PO may not be created in the PO Viewer. Today’s date is compared with the Start and End Dates on the Vendor Insurance tab in order to determine if the Insurance is expired. This prevents new PO’s from being backdated to when the insurance was in effect.
  </p>
  <p>
    <font style="font-weight: bold;">o Purchase o Credit</font><br/>
    By default, new purchase orders are flagged as Purchase.
  </p>
  <p>The Credit flag enables you to create a <font style="font-weight: bold;">credit purchase order</font>
    <font style="font-weight: bold;">;</font> you must change the type to Credit <font style="font-weight: bold; font-style: italic;">before</font> entering any detail lines (unless allowed via registry)<font style="font-weight: bold;">.</font>. A credit purchase order is used as a memo reminder to Accounts Payable. It will notify the user of an existing CREDIT purchase order in the system during the voucher entry in the A/P journal. Click <a href="Credit_PO_Details.htm">Credit PO Details</a> for important information on this subject. Note that Credit PO items must be received (if desired) on the PO.  Do not use the inventory receipts journal on credit po’s.
  </p>
  <p>Both vouchered and not yet vouchered Credit PO’s can be un-received.</p>
  <p>
    <font style="font-weight: bold;">FOB Id:</font><br/>
    Defines the FOB location. This field defaults from the Vendor record but may be changed by the user. Press Alt+F7 or double-click on this field to select from a list of FOB Ids.
  </p>
  <p>
    <font style="font-weight: bold;">Ship Via Id:</font><br/>
    Identifies the shipping method for this PO. This field defaults from the Vendor record but may be changed by the user. Press Alt+F7 or double-click left on this field to select from a list of Ship Via Ids. Double-click right to create or modify a Ship Via record.
  </p>
  <p>
    <font style="font-weight: bold;">Freight:</font>
    <font style="font-weight: bold;">Prepaid &amp; Add  Collect  Prepaid</font><br/>
    Indicate whether the freight charge (if any) is Prepaid &amp; Add, Collect or Prepaid. Use the Spacebar or double-click on an option to select/deselect it.
  </p>
  <p>
    <font style="font-weight: bold;">Purchase Order Description:</font> (40 character)<br/>
    This optional field briefly describes this purchase order for internal purposes. It appears on the Purchase Order viewer listing, making an individual PO easier for personnel at your company to identify. This description will not appear on the printed PO itself.
  </p>
  <p>
    <font style="font-weight: bold;">Ordered By:</font><br/>
    May be used for the name or initials of the individual requesting this order. This field defaults from the user id of the person creating the record id if it is blank when Purchase Order is created.
  </p>
  <p>
    <font style="font-weight: bold;">Currency Id: Currency Factor:</font><br/>
    If applicable, these display-only fields will default when the user sets the Vendor Id. The Currency Conversion Factor will be determined from the referenced Currency Master record and the effective date of the transaction. A Currency Conversion Factor of zero will automatically be converted to one.
  </p>
  <p>If the Currency Id field is completed, all costs MUST be entered in the Vendor’s currency. The system will handle the conversion of amounts entered in this foreign currency based on the applicable conversion factor in the Currency Master record.</p>
  <p>
    <font style="font-weight: bold;">Job Id:</font><br/>
    Complete this field if the items on this PO are being ordered to a specific Job. The system will use this Job Id as the default for all items ordered on this PO. This field should <font style="font-weight: bold;">not</font> be filled in if the WO Id is completed. <font style="font-weight: bold;">Note:</font> the user is warned if a closed Job is selected, and will not be allowed to add the PO if the PO’s Release Date exceeds the Job’s Date Closed.  
  </p>
  <p><span style="font-weight: bold;">
      <font style="font-weight: bold;">L</font>ien Waiver Req&#39;d?
    </span><br/>
    When BOTH the Job Record&#39;s Lien Waiver Required and the Vendor&#39;s Lien Waiver Required fields are checked, Purchase Orders for this Job and Vendor will also be flagged as Lien Waiver Required when they are created.  If a Work Order referenced in the PO header, the Lien Waiver flag will also be checked if BOTH the Work Order&#39;s header Job and the Vendor require Lien Waivers. The PO&#39;s Lien Waiver flag will carry through to individual Vendor Invoices and AP Checks.</p>
  <p>
    <font style="font-weight: bold;">WO Id:</font><br/>
    If this PO is for a specific Work Order, enter its Id; if this field is filled in, the Job field should <font style="font-weight: bold;">not</font> be completed. When a Work Order is referenced on a PO line, both the GL Entity and Cost Code will default from the Work Order. If this field is completed, it will be referenced on the printed PO instead of the Job Id.
  </p>
  <p style="margin-left: 36.00pt;">
    <font style="font-weight: bold;">Changes to WO Id:</font> The software denies changes to this field whenever the PO has any lines - received or not. If a PO is entered with the wrong info, the user must take the necessary steps to cancel it and enter the correct info as a new PO.
  </p>
  <p>
    <font style="font-weight: bold;">Tax Group Id:</font><br/>
    This field defaults from the Vendor record but may be altered if needed. It was designed to support Canadian GST/PST sales tax processing. It should only be completed if the applicable tax rules should come from the Vendor where you purchased the items in the case of buying / selling in different tax entities. It completed, this field provides the default value used to calculate the use tax cost for items entered on the General and Inventory Tabs. In version 8.1 and above, Inventory and Job quantities to be different when the PO parent has a Tax Group as long as the Inventory line has the same Tax Group.
  </p>
  <p>
    <font style="font-weight: bold;">Sales Tax Exempt:</font><br/>
    This display-only field defaults from the Vendor record; it will be checked if the Vendor has a Tax Exempt Certificate for your firm on file. If flagged, Tax Group in the Job record (or the Job referenced in the Work Order) will be used to compute Use Tax for taxable items.
  </p>
  <p>
    <font style="font-weight: bold;">Job Tax Status:</font><br/>
    This display-only field is derived from the Job / Work Order entered in the PO header.
  </p>
  <p></p>
  <p>To display the Sales Tax Group from the Job in the PO&#39;s header or the Work Order&#39;s Job from the PO header, this field allows users to easily view their tax group.</p>
  <p>
    <font style="font-weight: bold;">PO Id:</font><br/>
    If you are creating a new purchase order, this Id will be generated when you save the record. To change an existing PO, enter its Id.
  </p>
  <p>
    <font style="font-weight: bold;">Total Amount:</font><br/>
    This display-only field is maintained by the system, and also displayed on the top of all tabs.
  </p>
  <p>
    <font style="font-weight: bold;">Branch Id:</font><br/>
    This field will initially default from the Branch (if any) of the user creating the PO unless overridden via <a href="Registry_Entry_Global_Settings__Column_Compression__Dispatch_Board_Rows__History_Log_Inventory_Markup.htm#Global_Settings_Branch_Override">global registry to set the Branch from the Job&#39;s Branch</a>. If this registry is in effect and a Work Order or Job is selected in the PO header, the Branch will default from that Work Order or Job.

  </p>
  <p>
    <font style="font-weight: bold;">Ship To: Stock Location WorkSite ServiceProvider Other</font><br/>
    This field enables you to select the shipping address for this Purchase Order. By default, Stock Location is selected when manually generated a PO; this may be adjusted via the <a href="View_Custom_Fields.htm">Custom Fields</a> functionality if needed. The <a href="Registry_Entry_Purchase_Order.htm">Purchase Order Registry Entry</a> may be used to customize how the Ship-To address is generated for the Stock Location, WorkSite and/or ServiceProvider options.
  </p>
  <p>

  <p>
    <font style="font-weight: bold;">ServiceProvider</font><br/>
    This option should be selected if the items on this PO should be shipped directly to the Service Provider/Subcontractor. In order for the address to default correctly, the first Technician line of the associated Work Order must:
  </p>
  <p style="text-indent: 30.25pt;">Point to a Technician with the Remote Access set to Subcontractor</p>
  <p style="text-indent: 30.25pt;">In the Technician record, the Address (on Main screen) must be completed</p>

    By default, PO&#39;s are initially created with a status of released unless a user is NOT flagged as a Purchasing Agent in their User record. I<span>f the </span>
  </p>
  <p style="margin-left: 48px;">Vendor is marked as Insurance Required = &#39;Y&#39;  AND<br/>
    Vendor Insurance End Date &lt; today AND<br/>
    Block Purchases = &#39;Y&#39;</p>
  <p><span>the user will be alerted and the PO will NOT be created.</span></p>
  <p>PO&#39;s that are Unreleased are present as records in the system, but DO NOT write to IMH or other history until they are RELEASED.  This functionality enables review of PO created by users not flagged as Purchasing Agents (in the User record) prior to their release. It also allows for the timing of PO releases.  <font style="font-weight: bold;">Print PO Form</font> excludes PO’s with a status of Unreleased.</p>
  <p style="margin-left: 36.00pt;">To RELEASE Purchase Orders, complete the following steps:</p>
  <p style="margin-left: 36.00pt;"> 1. Have a user who is flagged as a Purchasing Agent in their User record access the unreleased PO.<br/>
    2. In the PO&#39;s Main tab, change the Accounting Period to an Active one (if needed).<br/>
    3. On the Status tab, verify that the Released Date falls within the Accounting Period date range.<br/>
    4. On the Status tab, select Release and then save the record. All necessary information will be written to history, and the PO will be available for vouchering in AP.</p>
  <p style="margin-left: 72.00pt;">
    <font style="font-weight: bold;">Tip:</font> The PO Filter screen includes a Status range. By entering unreleased in this range, and clearing the other range fields, you may easily review your unreleased po&#39;s.
  </p>
  <p>Most status changes are implemented by the system; for example, the status is changed to Printed when a Released or Changed PO is successfully printed. Printing a PO with a status of Pending Cancelled will reset its status to Cancelled.</p>
  <p>Other status changes can be made directly by the user by double-clicking on a new status (the system will not allow you to make an illegal status change). Any necessary postings or reversals will also be handled by the system even if the status is not changed. Click <a href="Purchase_Order_Status_Changes.htm">Purchase Order Status Changes</a> to view a table describing status changes and resulting system changes.</p>
  <p>The PO&#39;s Date Closed to the system date whenever the user sets PO&#39;s Status is set to Closed.</p>

    This display field will be completed if this PO is saved with a status of Changed.  This would occur if the Status was set to Printed, and then the user made a change to a line or added a line, and then saved the PO as a controlled document.  If this field is completed, it will appear in the Revision Date box of the printed PO.</p>
  <p>
    <font style="font-weight: bold;">Closed:</font><br/>
    The Closed date for this PO; this field may be completed by the user. It may also be set when the PO is vouchered if the Close PO box in the AP Journal is flagged. The PO&#39;s Date Closed is set to the system date whenever the PO&#39;s Status is set to Closed by the user. The user is prevented from setting the PO Date Closed prior to the PO&#39;s creation date.

    2. The &#39;re-opened&#39; status will be either Released or Printed.  The determination is made by evaluating the status of the PO&#39;s lines.  If any one of them is marked Printed, then the re-open status is Printed.  Otherwise, the re-open status is Released.<br/>
    3. The Date Closed is reset to 1900-01-01.<br/>
    4. The viewer will be refreshed after the button is pushed and the PO has been re-opened.<br/>
    5. An entry is added to the Record Change Log will show that the re-open button was pushed.</p>
  <p>
    <font style="font-weight: bold;">User PO Limit:</font><br/>
    This display field defaults from the maxpoamount key value on the User’s Registry tab. If this field is completed and the user is flagged as a Purchase Agent, it represents the maximum dollar amount of a PO that the user can save as released. If this limit is exceeded, the PO may be saved as Unreleased. A User with a higher PO limit can then edit and release the Purchase Order.
