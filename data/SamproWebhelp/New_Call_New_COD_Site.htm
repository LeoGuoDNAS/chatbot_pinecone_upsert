<h1>New Call - New COD Site</h1>
<p class="Reference_Line" style="margin-bottom: 0.00pt;">This screen is displayed when you click the New COD Site button on the New Call 2 screen. It enables you to create new Site and Equipment records as well as a work order for this site.</p>
<p><font style="font-weight: bold;">Important Note:</font> the same job pointed to by the template equipment will also be pointed to by the new equipment that is created as by this function - not a new job created just for the new site. Therefore, this function is only applicable to sites created for COD jobs or specific types of one-off jobs or warranty jobs.</p>
<p>See <a href="Setting_up_COD_Jobs_for_New_Call_2.htm">Setting up COD Jobs for New Call 2</a> for tips on setting up records for this function.</p>
<h2>Upper Section: Data-Entry Fields</h2>
<p><font style="font-weight: bold;">Site Name:</font><br/>
The name of the Client Site. The Site Id will be auto-generated when you click the Add Record button.</p>
<p><font style="font-weight: bold;">Street Address:<br/></font> The actual (street) address of this Site, as it will appear in the Site Record and on the Work Order.</p>
<p><font style="font-weight: bold;">City: State:  Zip Code:<br/></font>If implemented on your system, the City and State will default in when you enter the Zip Code. The display-only Service Zone and Tax Authority fields will also default from the Zip Code record.</p>
<p><font style="font-weight: bold;">Site Voice Phone:</font><br/>
The main number for this Site; this information will be copied to the new Client Site record.</p>
<p><font style="font-weight: bold;">Market Source Id:</font><br/>
The advertising source (yellow pages, radio spot, etc.) that generated this call. Double-click on this field or press Alt+F7 to select from a list of Market Sources. This field is optional.</p>
<p><font style="font-weight: bold;">First Name: Last Name:<br/></font> Enter the First and Last Name of the person calling or the primary contact for this site. These fields will be used to generate the Contact 1 fields in the Site record that will be created.</p>
<p><font style="font-weight: bold;">Email Address:</font><br/>
The main e-mail address for this Site (if available).</p>
<p><font style="font-weight: bold;">Dispatch Note<br/></font>When completed, this field will be written to the Client Site’s Dispatch Note field. This optional field is designed to provide useful information (e.g., Guard Dog, Call Owner, etc.) to the Dispatcher / Technician.</p>

<p><span style="font-weight: bold;">Sales Tax Group Id:</span><br/>
The User may select the Sales Tax Group to be written to the COP tab of the new Site being added. This feature should eliminate the need to have separate COD jobs created for each possible Sales Tax Group combination during setup. <a data-target="POPUP617096865" data-rhwidget="DropSpot" href="#" class="dropspot"><span data-open-text="true" data-skip-index="true">Click to see IMPORTANT SETUP information.</span><span data-close-text="true">Click to see IMPORTANT SETUP information.</span></a></p>
<div data-targetname="POPUP617096865">
<p>In SAMPro, if the COD Job does not reference a Site (as is the case for COD/MFG Warranty Type Jobs),  Service Compute/Invoicing will use the Site&#39;s Sales Tax Group Id instead (from the COP tab) to compute the Sales Tax on the invoice. However, multiple COD jobs are still needed for payroll tax purposes to determine correct State/Local tax codes.</p>
<p style="margin-left: 48px;"><span style="font-weight: bold;">Important:</span> if the COD Job selected has the Sales Tax Group already set, it will not be used to populate this field. Also note that if the ZIP Code Table contains a Sales Tax Group Id for the zip code entered, the system will use it to populate this field; the user may select a different Sales Tax Group if needed.</p>
<p style="margin-left: 48px;"><span style="font-weight: bold;">Multiple COD Jobs by Sales Tax Group:</span><br/>
It may not be possible to eliminate these Jobs if they are already setup and being used.  Listed below are issues to consider:  </p>
<p style="margin-left: 88px;">1-All the existing COD sites will need to be updated to contain a Sales Tax Group on the COP tab.</p>
<p style="margin-left: 88px;">2-All the Site Equipment for these COD sites ‘Default Service’ Job will need to reference either a Taxable or Non-Taxable (exempt) COD Job (with no Sales Tax Group or Site).</p>
<p style="margin-left: 88px;">3-If tracking state tax authorities for payroll purposes on the Financial tab of the Job, then taxable &amp; exempt COD Jobs by state are needed.  The Site Equipment ‘Default Service’ Job will need to reference the correct taxable or exempt COD Job by state.  If you are tracking local tax authorities for payroll, then it’s doubtful your existing setup would change.</p>
</div>
<p><span style="font-weight: bold;">Store #</span><br/>
This field enables the new Site&#39;s Store # field to be set if applicable.</p>

<p><span style="font-weight: bold;">Original Caller</span><br/>
This field lists the person who called in this Work Order. If completed by the user, it will be written to the Work Order&#39;s Original Caller field.</p>

<p><font style="font-weight: bold;">Work Code:</font><br/>
Enter a Work Code Id or double click to select from a list. If you select a Work Code with an assigned Call Script, the system will immediately prompt you to respond to the Call Script questions. The Work Code Name and Estimated Hours fields are set from the Work Code record. This field is optional.</p>
<p><font style="font-weight: bold;">Zip</font> <font style="font-weight: bold;">Branch</font><font style="font-weight: bold;"><br/></font>If Branch Id’s are included in your Zip Code records, this field will be displayed when the dispatcher enters the zip code. It is designed to assist the dispatcher in selecting the correct, branch-specific client site template for the new COD customer.  </p>

<p><font style="font-weight: bold;">Work Requested:</font><br/>
Briefly describes the work requested by the customer. This field will default to the Work Requested field on the Equipment tab, and to the Work Requested field in the Work Order header, which will be printed on most invoice formats.</p>
<p><font style="font-weight: bold;">Tech Finder Button<br/></font><img src="assets/images/image/techfinder.gif" alt="image\techfinder.gif" title="image\techfinder.gif" width="48" height="28" border="0"/> When you click this button, the TechFinder screen will appear to help you to quickly assign the call to the optimal technician and best date and time. If the Equipment selected includes a Certification Id, only those technicians with a matching valid Certification will be listed when the TechFinder viewer appears.</p>
<p><font style="font-weight: bold;">Date Scheduled:</font> <font style="font-weight: bold;">Time Scheduled:</font><br/>
If you did not use TechFinder to do so, you may enter the date and time the work is scheduled for in these fields.</p>
<p style="margin-left: 29.50pt;">Enter the date in <font style="font-style: italic;">MMDDYYYY</font> format, double-click on the Date field to open SAMPro&#39;s calendar, or press the Spacebar to enter the current date.</p>
<p style="margin-left: 29.50pt;">Enter the scheduled time in 24-hour or military format or double-click on this field to access the Clock Viewer to do so. Press the Spacebar to enter the current time.</p>
<p>Note that the Date and Time fields are optional, and that the Date can be set from the Dispatch Board. If you do not enter a date, it will automatically default to January 1, 1900 unless a different default date is specified via a registry entry.</p>
<p><font style="font-weight: bold;">Technician Id:</font><br/>
Enter a valid Technician Id or double-click on this field to select from a list of active technicians. This field is optional; the technician may be assigned from the dispatch board.</p>
<p><font style="font-weight: bold;">Estimated Hours</font><br/>
This field defaults from the Work Code but may be modified by the user.</p>
<p><font style="font-weight: bold;">Priority:</font><br/>
The priority level for this call. Zero (0) is the highest priority (most critical), and 9 the lowest (least critical).</p>
<p><font style="font-weight: bold;">Job Id: Job Costing Code: Job Billing Item:</font></p>
<p>The Job Cost Code field is exposed in standard customizations, allowing the user to override the default Job Cost Code field that comes from the selected Site Template Equipment and use the select Cost Code for ONLY the new work order being created. The new Equipment generated from the template will continue to use the default job cost code/billing item, not the override entered in New Call COD Site.</p>
<p><img src="assets/images/image/TimeSlotWizard.gif" alt="image\TimeSlotWizard.gif" title="image\TimeSlotWizard.gif" width="88" height="28" border="0"/></p>
<p>Clicking this button will launch the wizard to select an available Time Slot for the new work order. Note that it is not necessary to assign a Technician to select a Time Slot.</p>
<p><font style="font-weight: bold;">Time Slot Id:<br/></font>This display-only field will be set when the Time Slot wizard is run.</p>
<p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"> </p>
<h2>Middle Section: List of Templates Sites</h2>
<p>The middle section of this screen lists only those sites that have been flagged as a template in the Site record. When you create a new COD Site using the selected template, copies of the Equipment records associated with the template site will be attached to the new site.</p>
<h2>Lower Section: List of Equipment</h2>
<p>This pane lists the equipment associated with the selected template site. Select the Equipment that should appear on the work order.</p>
<p style="margin-left: 36.00pt;"><font style="font-weight: bold;">Important Note:</font> the same job pointed to by the template equipment will also be pointed to by the new equipment that is created as by this function - not a new job created just for the new site. Therefore, this function is only applicable to sites created for COD jobs or specific types of one-off jobs or warranty jobs.</p>
