<h1>Inventory Item Adjustment Journal</h1>
<h2>Purpose:</h2>
<p>This function enables you to easily adjust the quantity of items at 
 a particular location or job, or to transfer items between jobs, locations, 
 or between locations and jobs. It may also be used to adjust the average 
 cost of an item.</p>
<h2>Usage:</h2>
<p>When Intercompany is enabled, changes 
 to a To or From line&#39;s GL Entity are validated to ensure that the new 
 GL Entity belongs to the same Company as the Job or Location on that same 
 line. </p>
<p>Adjustment and Transfer transactions cannot be changed or reversed directly: 
 you must create a new transaction to effect any desired adjustments since 
 no edits are allowed.</p>
<p>Use Tax calculations are implemented for job-related activity entered 
 in this Journal. Use tax will be included in material cost, material wip, 
 and total job cost in JCH. The computed use tax will also be posted as 
 additional expense and liability into the GLH.</p>
<p>This function posts the WO (when available) and Job references to Inventory 
 History for Job-Location and Location-Job entries for informational purposes.</p>
<p>Serialized items can be added if enabled via registry (see below). The 
 adjustment to add the item would be made with the Location on the &#39;To&#39; 
 line completed. The GL Entity would be required on the &#39;To&#39; line if Intercompany 
 was enabled.</p>
<h2>Registry:</h2>
<p>See <a href="Registry_Entry_Inventory_Adjustments_Journal.htm">Registry 
 Inventory Adjustments Journal (sys-viewer-vinvntryadjstmnt)</a> for registry 
 entries impacting this journal as well as the Return to Inventory Wizard 
 (in the Work Order viewer) and the Fill Lines Wizard. An entry pertaining 
 to the Wizards may be used to set the Quantity Billed from the To Return 
 quantity.</p>
<h2>Important Fields: Upper Section</h2>
<p class="Tab">Main Tab</p>
<p><font style="font-weight: bold;">Transaction Id:</font><br/>
This field is generated by the system when you save the transaction.</p>
<p><font style="font-weight: bold;">Period Id:</font><br/>
The Accounting Period to which this transaction is assigned. This field 
 should be completed if you are specifying GL Accounts.</p>
<p><font style="font-weight: bold;">Effective Date:</font><br/>
The Effective Date for this transaction: this date must fall within the 
 range defined by the Accounting Period you selected in the previous field.</p>
<p><font style="font-weight: bold;">Adjustment Description:</font><br/>
This optional field may be used to briefly describe this transaction.</p>
<p><font style="font-weight: bold;">Transaction Type:</font></p>
<p style="margin-left: 36.00pt;"><font style="font-weight: bold;">Loc-to-Loc<br/>
Loc-to-Job</font> <font style="font-weight: bold;"><br/>
Job-to-Job<br/>
Job-to-Loc<br/>
Adjustment</font></p>
<p>This field implements validation logic that ensures that the data entry 
 for Transfers is consistent with the selected Transaction Type.  For 
 example, entry of job-related data is not permitted on a Loc-to-Loc (Location 
 to Location) transfer transaction. Before entering your transfer data, 
 select the appropriate Transaction Type. The Loc-to-Job, Job-to-Loc, and 
 Job-to-Job also support Work Orders.</p>
<p>The Transaction Type of Adjustment permits data entry according to the 
 previous rules due to the wide variety of adjustments that may be made. 
  Validation has been added to this 
 journal in Version 9.1 to prevent incorrectly entered &#39;Adjustment&#39; transaction 
 types from generating out of balance GL and/or Job History entries. 
  During data conversion, existing records created before this field 
 was available will be displayed as Adjustments.</p>

<p>This button is designed to help you return inventory items entered on 
 a Job or Work Order to your stock location, or to transfer all items from 
 one location to another. This button currently supports the transaction 
 type of</p>
<p style="margin-left: 48px;">Job-to-Loc: See <a href="Inventory_Adjustment_Fill_Lines_Wizard.htm">Inventory 
 Adjustment Fill Lines Wizard</a> for details on completing the Wizard 
 screens to return stock from a Job or Work Order to a Location.</p>
<p style="margin-left: 48px;">Loc-toLoc: See <a href="Inventory_Adjustment_Location_to_Location_Fill_Lines_Wizard.htm">Inventory 
 Adjustment Location to Location Fill Lines Wizard</a>  for details 
 on transferring stock at one location to another.  </p>
<p style="margin-left: 48px;"> <font style="font-weight: bold;">IMPORTANT:</font> 
 After completing the Wizard, and making any changes needed, you must SAVE 
 the journal entry for the transfer to be made.</p>
<p><font style="font-weight: bold;">User Id: Date Posted:</font><br/>
These display-only fields are maintained by the system based on the User 
 Id of the individual entering the transaction and the system date when 
 the transaction is saved.</p>
<p> </p>
<p class="Tab">GLH Tab</p>
<p>This tab displays the GL History postings associated with this transaction. 
 The following columns appear on this tab:</p>
<p style="margin-left: 36.00pt;">Account - Account Name - Entity<br/>
Period – Company - Security<br/>
I/C (Yes if this post was generated by Intercompany Processing, No if not)<br/>
Journal - Trx Id – Date - Trx Count</p>
<h2>Important Fields: Lower Section</h2>
<p class="Tab">Inventory</p>
<p>The detailed information in this tab is grouped into three lines. The 
 first line defines which inventory item is being adjusted or transferred, 
 its quantity, cost, and price. The second line (Adjust:From) will be completed 
 for both Inventory Adjustments and Transfers. The third line, To:, should 
 only be completed for transfers.</p>
<p><img src="assets/images/image/Magnify.gif" alt="" style="border: none;" border="0"/> 
 Click the Magnify button to display the Full View of the selected line.</p>
<h2>Line 1: Inventory Item Information</h2>
<p><font style="font-weight: bold;">Inventory Item Id: Inventory Item Name:</font><br/>
Enter the Id of an item that is being adjusted or double-click to select 
 from a list. This field is required.</p>
<p><font style="font-weight: bold;">Serial Number:</font><br/>
This field is required for serialized or lot-controlled items. The system 
 checks if the serialized item is actually on-hand at the From location 
 when moving from a Location to a Job or Location when the journal entry 
 is saved. It does not test for its presence in the To Job or the From 
 Job. Validation prevents the transfer of more than 1 of a serial number 
 from a job into a location.</p>

	 the case where SAMPro thinks the item is in stock but actually it 
	 isn&#39;t.  This provides an alternative method of removing a serial 
	 item to the Physical Count functionality. To remove a serial item, 
	 your entry should be set up as follows:</span></span></p>
	<p style="margin-left: 88px;"><span style="font-weight: bold;">Transaction 
	 Type:</span> Adjustment<br/>
	<span style="font-weight: bold;">Inventory Item Id: Serial Number:</span>

	 but the Serial/Lot record is not deleted.</span></p></div>
<p style="margin-left: 8px;"><font style="font-weight: bold;">Quantity:</font><br/>
If this is a <font style="font-weight: bold;">transfer</font> transaction, 
 enter the quantity (as a positive number) that will be transferred out 
 of the From/Adjust: line and into the To: line.</p>
<p>If this is an <font style="font-weight: bold;">adjustment</font> transaction, 
 enter a positive number to increase the quantity of this item in the job 
 or location specified in the From/Adjust: line. Enter a negative number 
 to decrease the quantity of this item in the job or location specified 
 in the From/Adjust: line. The GL Account must be blanked since one-sided 
 GL transactions are not allowed.</p>
<p class="Body_Text" style="margin-left: 36.00pt;"><font style="font-weight: bold;">Tip:</font> 
 To take Inventory costs off (-) a progress Job - enter a POSITIVE quantity

 only valid quantities are 1 and -1.</p>
<p class="Body_Text"><font style="font-weight: bold;">Unit Cost:</font><br/>
This field defaults from the Inventory record for manually created entries. 
  The overall item last cost will default if the location-specific 
 cost is zero.  You may change this field in order to make adjustments 
 to Average Costs.</p>
<p class="Body_Text" style="margin-left: 48px;"><span style="font-weight: bold;">Serialized 
 Items:</span>  For serialized/lot controlled items, the Unit Cost 
 defaults when you enter the serial/lot number. The true cost (last and 
 average) of a Serialized time will always be the same; since it is serialized 
 it is always dealt with as being unique and always a quantity of one. Therefore, 
 when transferring a serialized item, the cost of the item will always 
 be its actual purchased price (or with sales tax included), regardless 
 of your costing method (last or average).  </p>
<p class="Body_Text">If this entry was generated via Wizard (using the 
 Fill Lines Button in the Adjustment Journal, or the Return To Inventory 
 button in the Work Order), the cost is based on the actual Job History 
 value recorded when the item was initially added to the Work Order / Job, 
 thus allowing the transaction to be &#39;undone&#39; using the exact values present 
 when it was initially created.</p>

<h3>Line 2: Transfer From and Adjustments: Adjustment Journal</h3>
<p><font style="font-weight: bold;">Work Order Id:</font><font style="font-weight: bold;"><br/>
</font>This field allows the transfer of inventory:</p>
<p style="margin-left: 36.00pt;">From a Location to a Work Order (Transaction 
 Type Loc-to-Job)</p>
<p style="margin-left: 36.00pt;">From a Work Order to Work Order (Transaction 
 Type Job-to-Job)</p>
<p style="margin-left: 36.00pt;">From a Work Order to a Location (Transaction 
 Type Job-to-Loc)</p>
<p>When the Inventory Adjustment transaction is saved, it will be written 
 to Job History. In the Work Order, the Get Costs button allows the user 
 to import these transactions into the Work Order, and make any desired 
 changes to the Quantity Billed (currently not set by this function).</p>
<p><font style="font-weight: bold;">Equipment Id</font><font style="font-weight: bold;">:<br/>
</font>You must click the Magnify button to see this field. The Equipment 
 Id from the Work Order will default, but may be changed by the user.</p>
<p><font style="font-weight: bold;">Job Id: Job Cost Code Id:</font> <font style="font-weight: bold;">Bill Item:</font> <font style="font-weight: bold;">Cost 
 Category Id:</font><br/>
Complete these fields if inventory is being adjusted at or transferred 
 out of this job. Note that the Location Id on this line must be blank 
 if these Job fields are filled in.</p>
<p>Cost Categories with a Selection Cost 
 Type of Equipment or Material are allowed. The Cost Category also supports 
 enhanced filtering provided by the Cost Code&#39;s Job Cost Category Usage 
 Filter. Cost Categories are validated (relative to Cost Codes) during 
 data entry upon leaving the Cost Category Id field.  The full relationship 
 is validated again when leaving a child line or saving a record.</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: bold;">On-Hand:</span><br/>
If the Location field is completed, the current On-Hand quantity (if any) 
 will appear these display-only fields.</p>
<p><font style="font-weight: bold;">Location Id:</font><br/>
Complete this field if inventory is being adjusted at or transferred out 
 of this location. Note that the Job Id, Job Cost Code, and Cost Category 
 fields on this line must be blank if the Location field is filled in.</p>
<p><font style="font-weight: bold;">GL Account:</font><br/>
This field is optional for transfer transactions. It must be blanked if 
 this is an adjustment entry since one-sided GL transactions are not allowed.</p>
<p>If the Location Id is completed on this line, this field will default 
 from the Inventory Asset Account specified in the Inventory Group record 
 associated with this Inventory Item. If the Job fields are completed on 
 this line, this field will default from the Job Cost Category&#39;s Expense 
 Account (e.g., COS Material), overriding the Account in the Inventory 
 Group record.</p>
<p><font style="font-weight: bold;">GL Entity:</font><br/>
If a Location is specified on this line, the system will look to the Location 
 record first to default this field: if the GL Entity in the Location record 
 is empty, the GL Entity will default from the Inventory Group record. 
 If a Job is specified on this line, this field will default from the Job 
 Cost Code record. When Intercompany is 
 enabled, changes to the GL Entity are validated to ensure that the new 
 GL Entity belongs to the same Company as the Job or Location.

<p><img src="assets/images/image/Magnify.gif" alt="" style="border: none;" border="0"/> 
 Click the Magnify button to see the following fields.</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: bold;">Quantity Billable:<br/>
</span>This field defaults from the Quantity field, and will be used to 
 update Job History if a Work Order or Job is being impacted. It may be 
 cleared by the user.</p>
<p>For example, if the Transaction Type is Job to Location, and you have 
 specified a Work Order, when you import costs in the Work Order, the item 
 will appear as a negative quantity AND a negative billable quantity even 
 though the quantities are entered as positive values in this journal. 
 </p>
<p>If this transaction was generated as a result of running a Wizard (from 
 the Work Order&#39;s Return to Inventory button or the Adjustment Journal&#39;s 
 Fill Lines button) the Quantity Billable will only default from the Quantity 
 if enabled via registry.  </p>
<p><span style="font-weight: bold;">Extra:<br/>
</span>This field should be flagged if the item should be flagged as an 
 Extra for Allow Extra Billing Items. </p>
<p><span style="font-weight: bold;">Billing Rate Id:<br/>
</span>This field will default to markup a Job or Work Order is specified 
 and the Inventory Item is NOT flagged as Use Unit Prices.  If a Job 
 or Work Order is specified and the Inventory Item is flagged as Use Unit 
 Prices, this field defaults to unit price.  </p>
<p><span style="font-weight: bold;">Revenue Rate:</span><br/>
If a Job or Work Order is specified and the Inventory Item is flagged as 
 Use Unit Prices, this field defaults to the Unit Price associated with 
 the Price Level specified in the Job.  If the item is not flagged 
 as Use Unit Prices, the Revenue Rate will be set according the Material 
 Markup specified in the Job/WO&#39;s Rate Schedule.  </p>
<p style="font-weight: bold;">Unit Price:<br/>
<span style="font-weight: normal;">If a Job or Work Order is specified 
 and the Inventory Item is flagged as Use Unit Prices, this field defaults 
 to the Unit Price associated with the Price Level specified in the Job. 
  If the item is not flagged as Use Unit Prices, the Unit Price is 
 calculated based on the current Cost, Billing Rate and Revenue fields 
 if this entry is being manually generated.</span></p>
<p style="font-weight: normal;">If this entry was generated via Wizard 
 (using the Fill Lines Button in the Adjustment Journal, or the Return 
 To Inventory button in the Work Order), the revenue values are based on 
 the actual Job History values recorded when the item was initially added 
 to the Work Order / Job, thus allowing the transaction to be &#39;undone&#39; 
 using the exact costs and revenues present when it was initially created.</p>
<p style="font-weight: bold;">Amount Revenue:<br/>
<span style="font-weight: normal;">This field defaults based on the Quantity 
 Billable and the Unit Price. Adjustments referencing Fixed Fee / Allow 
 Extra Billing Items will only calculate revenue if the user manually flags 
 the Extra box.</span></p>
<p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"> </p>
<h2>Line 3: Transfer To:</h2>
<p><font style="font-weight: bold;">Work Order Id:</font><br/>
Complete this field only if an item is being transferred to this Work Order. 
 The Job-related fields on this line will default from the Work Order header.</p>
<p><font style="font-weight: bold;">Equipment Id</font><font style="font-weight: bold;">:<br/>
</font>You must click the Magnify button to see this field. The Equipment 
 Id from the Work Order will default, but may be changed by the user.</p>
<p><font style="font-weight: bold;">Job Id: Job Cost Code Id:</font> <font style="font-weight: bold;">Bill Item:</font> <font style="font-weight: bold;">Cost 
 Category Id:</font><br/>
Complete these fields if inventory is being transferred to this job. Note 
 that the Location Id on this line must be blank if these Job fields are 
 filled in. If the Effective Date of the entry falls after the Date Closed 
 (if any) of the Job, a warning message will be displayed.</p>
<p>The Cost Category supports enhanced 
 filtering provided by the Cost Code&#39;s Job Cost Category Usage Filter. 
 Cost Categories are validated (relative to Cost Codes) during data entry 
 upon leaving the Cost Category Id field.  The full relationship is 
 validated again when leaving a child line or saving a record. Cost Categories 
 with a Selection Cost Type of Equipment or Material are supported.</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: bold;">On-Hand:</span><br/>
If the Location field is completed, the current On-Hand quantity (if any) 
 will appear these display-only fields.</p>
<p><font style="font-weight: bold;">Location Id:</font><br/>
Complete this field if inventory is being transferred to this location. 
 Note that the Job Id, Job Cost Code, and Cost Category fields on this 
 line must be blank if the Location field is filled in.</p>
<p><font style="font-weight: bold;">GL Account:</font><br/>
If the Location Id is completed on this line, this field will default from 
 the Inventory Asset Account specified in the Inventory Group record associated 
 with this Inventory Item. If the Job fields are completed on this line, 
 this field will default from the Job Cost Category Expense Account (e.g., 
 COS Material), overriding the Account in the Inventory Group record.</p>
<p><font style="font-weight: bold;">GL Entity:</font><br/>
If a Location is specified on this line, the system will look to the Location 
 record first to default this field: if the GL Entity in the Location record 
 is empty, the GL Entity will default from the Inventory Group record. 
 If a Job is specified on this line, this field will default from the Job 
 Cost Code record. When Intercompany is 
 enabled, changes to the GL Entity are validated to ensure that the new 
 GL Entity belongs to the same Company as the Job or Location.</p>

 being impacted. It may be cleared by the user.</span></p>
<p style="font-weight: normal;">For example, if the Transaction Type is 
 Location to Job, and you have specified a Work Order, when you import

 Cost Adjustment Examples</h2>
<h3>Example 1: Average Cost Adjustments (impacting GL)</h3>
<p>To change the average cost at a location, you will make an Adjustment 
 type entry with two lines. The first effectively zeros out the on-hand 
 stock at the location of interest at its current cost. For example, if 
 I had 14 items of 123106 on hand at Main, my first line will show a quantity 
 of -14. The second line would add the inventory back (14) in at the desired 
 cost. Note that in this example these entries also impact GL.</p>
<p>For positive quantities, the GL Account on the FROM/ADJUST line is used 
 for the “CREDIT” entry &amp; the “TO” line is used for the DEBIT 
 entry. For minus quantities, the rules change a bit since MINUS CREDIT 
 = DEBIT.</p>
<p><font style="font-weight: bold;">Line 1: Zeroing stock at old average 
 cost</font></p>
<p>Inventory Item Id: 123106       Quantity: 
 -14   Cost: 55.232  (the cost defaults in when you 
 select a location)</p>
<p>From/Adj: Main    GL Account: 50111        (creates 
 MINUS CREDIT which will DEBIT inventory adj, restock or COS)</p>
<p>To: Main             GL 
 Account: 10150        (creates 
 MINUS DEBIT which will CREDIT  inventory)</p>

<p><font style="font-weight: bold;">Line 2: Reentering stock at new average 
 cost</font></p>
<p>Inventory Item Id: 123106       Quantity: 
 14   Cost: 57.000  <font style="font-weight: bold;">(manually 
 enter the cost AFTER you select a location)</font></p>
<p>From/Adj: Main    GL Account: 50111         (creates 
 CREDIT to inventory adj, restock or COS)</p>
<p>To: Main            GL 
 Account: 10150        (creates 
 DEBIT to inventory)</p>
<p style="margin-left: 36.00pt; margin-top: 0.00pt;"> </p>
<h3>Example 2: Average Cost Adjustments (NOT impacting GL)</h3>
<p>In this example, NO GL accounts are required to make the average cost 
 adjustments.  This would leave the GL unchanged during these 
 transactions and a GL Journal entry may be entered if necessary to affect 
 the proper accounts.</p>
<p>To adjust the average cost, you will need to make an Adjustment type 
 entry with two lines. The first effectively zeros out the on-hand stock 
 at the location of interest at its current cost. For example, if I had 
 14 items of 123106 on hand at Main, my first line will show a quantity 
 of -14. The second line would add the inventory back (14) in at the desired 
 cost. Note that in this example both lines are adjustments, and they do 
 not impact GL.</p>
