<h1>Deductions Viewer</h1>
<h2>Purpose:</h2>
<p>Create and maintain the Deductions records for Miscellaneous, 401(k) 
 Section 125 and Pre-Tax payroll deductions.</p>
<h2>Example:</h2>
<p>Vacation, 401(k), Section 125, etc.</p>
<h2>Registry:</h2>
<p><span><a href="Registry_Entry_Global_Settings__Column_Compression__Dispatch_Board_Rows__History_Log_Inventory_Markup.htm#Use_Control_Records_GL_Entities_for_PR">Use 
 Control Records&#39; GL Entities for PR Deductions, Earnings, Taxes, etc,.Instead 
 of Employees&#39;</a>.</span></p>
<h2>Usage:</h2>
<p>Deductions records are required for Deduction Group records, and are 
 referenced on the DED tab of the Payroll Adjustment Journal, and the Employee 
 Record Deduction tab.</p>
<p><font style="font-weight: bold; text-decoration: underline; ">Can</font><font style="font-weight: bold; text-decoration: underline; ">a</font><font style="font-weight: bold; text-decoration: underline; ">dian Users</font></p>
<p>In order for Union Dues and Charitable Deductions to correctly print 
 on the T4, the user must populate the field ‘Deduction User 1’ with Dues 
 or Charitable, respectively, and ensure that the Deduction Type is Other 
 Pre-Tax.</p>
<p>Canadian T4&#39;s now also use the W2 Category fields in the Deductions 
 &amp; Earnings records to populate the Other Information boxes on the 
 T4. The W2 category must be filled in as OI:(Code # for T4). The Employee 
 User 7 field is used to print the registration number in box 50 on the 
 T4.</p>
<h2>Important Fields:</h2>
<p><font style="font-weight: bold;">Note:</font> this Help Topic lists 
 the standard configuration of all fields that may be included in this 
 record. If you are using a customized system, the fields displayed on 
 your screen may not exactly match the order or status (required, optional, 
 default, display-only, hidden, etc.) of the fields described in this Topic.</p>
<p><font style="font-weight: bold;">Deduction Id:</font> (15 character, 
 only . and - special characters)<br/>
A unique Id for this payroll deduction. This field is required.</p>
<p><font style="font-weight: bold;">Description:</font> (40 character)<br/>
A brief description. This field is optional but recommended.</p>
<p><font style="font-weight: bold;">Security Id:</font><br/>
If multiple location security is implemented on your centralized database 
 system, this informational field displays the Security Id of the local 
 user that created this record. If multiple location security is not implemented 
 on your system, or if this record was created by a global user, this field 
 will be blank.</p>
<p><font style="font-weight: bold;">Check Label:</font> (10 character)<br/>
The label you wish to appear on payroll checks for deductions of this type.</p>
<p><font style="font-weight: bold;">Type:</font><br/>
Select Miscellaneous (by double-clicking on its radio button) if this record 
 pertains to taxable deductions such as union dues (US installations). 
 Select 401(k) only if this is a 401(k) deduction, or Section 125 if this 
 is a Section 125 deduction. If you select Other Pre-Tax, this deduction 
 will be taken before tax is computed. </p>
<p style="margin-left: 48px;"><span style="font-weight: bold;">Canadian 
 Installations:</span> In order for Union Dues and Charitable Deductions 
 to correctly print on the T4, the user must populate the field ‘Deduction 
 User 1’ with Dues or Charitable, respectively, and ensure that the Deduction 
 Type is Other Pre-Tax.</p>
<p style="margin-left: 48px;"><font color="#000000">RRSP (Registered Retirement 
 Savings Plan) is for Canadian firms only.</font></p>
<p><font style="font-weight: bold;">Amount:</font><br/>
Specifies the default amount of the deduction as a fixed dollar amount, 
 dollar amount per hour, or percentage. Unless this amount is exactly the 
 same for all employees entitled to this deduction, this field should remain 
 blank. Instead, the Amount field in the Deduction tab of the Employee 
 record (for non-union deductions) or the Deductions Group record would 
 be used to default the deduction amount.</p>
<p><font style="font-weight: bold;">Amount Type:</font><br/>
If the Amount to be deducted is a flat amount regardless of pay rate or 
 salary, select Fixed by double-clicking on its radio button. If the Amount 
 to be deducted is a dollar amount to be assessed each hour the employee 
 works, select Hourly. If this deduction is calculated as a percent of 
 wages, select Percent.</p>
<p style="margin-left: 36.00pt;"><font style="font-weight: bold;">Important 
 Note:</font> the Deduction Amount Type of ‘Standard’ is reserved for future 
 use, and should NOT be selected.</p>
<p><font style="font-weight: bold;">Limit:</font> (numeric format 000000.00)<br/>
The dollar limit (if any) for deductions of this type.</p>
<p style="margin-left: 36.00pt;"><font style="font-weight: bold;">IMPORTANT 
 NOTE:</font> If the Employee&#39;s Deduction limit is 0, compute payroll uses 
 the Deduction Limit and Deduction Limit Type from the BASE Deduction record. 
  This being the case, then when setting the Deduction Limit Types 
 (n/a, annual, pay period, etc) in the BASE Deduction, the BASE Deduction 
 should contain the UNIVERSAL RULE that apply to ALL employees,  if 
 the deduction limit type varies by employee, then set the Deduction Limit 
 Type to &quot;N/A&quot; in the BASE Deduction.</p>
<p><font style="font-weight: bold;">Limit Type:</font><br/>
If deductions of this type have no dollar limit, select N/A by double-clicking 
 on its radio button. If deductions are capped by law or company policy, 
 select the appropriate time period for the Limit (Pay Period, Monthly, 
 Annual, or Quarterly).</p>
<p><font style="font-weight: bold;">GL Account Id:</font><br/>
Enter the account to be credited with this deduction.</p>
<p><font style="font-weight: bold;">GL Entity Id</font><br/>
Optional. The Entity (department or profit center) assigned to this Deduction. 
 However, if a GL Entity Id has been entered in the Employee record, the 
 debit will be applied to the GL Entity in the Employee record. If the 
 GL Entity Id field is blank in the Employee record, the system will credit 
 the GL Entity in the Deduction. If the GL Entity is blank in both the 
 Employee and Deduction records, a GL Entity will not be credited during 
 Compute Payroll.</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: bold;">This behavior may be overridden via</span><span> 
 <a href="Registry_Entry_Global_Settings__Column_Compression__Dispatch_Board_Rows__History_Log_Inventory_Markup.htm#Use_Control_Records_GL_Entities_for_PR">Use 
 Control Records&#39; GL Entities for PR Deductions, Earnings, Taxes, etc,.Instead 
 of Employees&#39;</a></span><span>.</span></p>
<p><font style="font-weight: bold;">W-2 Category:</font><br/>
The purpose of this field is to enable the user to write to various W2 
 boxes by entering a 2-character box number (in the case of box 12, followed 
 by a code) in the appropriate W-Category box. Note that only those boxes 
 that can be controlled by an Earnings or Deduction entry to PR History 
 (via normal processing Compute or PR Adjustment entries) are supported.</p>
<p><font style="text-decoration: underline; ">Note: please consult the 
 IRS website / your firm’s CPA before proceeding.</font> The system does 
 NOT validate that a particular earning or deduction is configured correctly 
 for particular box/code as far is IRS rules are concerned. The W2 functionality 
 is implemented by querying PR History for entries when the Earning or 
 Deduction record’s W-2 Category is completed, and then summing the entries 
 for each particular category. The user MUST ensure and test that the W-2 
 Category field is configured in such a way as to give the desired result.</p>
<p style="margin-left: 36.00pt;"><font style="font-weight: bold;">Value Use</font></p>
<p> 10 Dependent Care benefits</p>
<p style="margin-left: 72.00pt;">Previously, this functionality was only 
 supported by entering DC in the User 1 field. The old functionality is 
 still supported in his image, but will be overridden by the use of the 
 new W-2 Category field.</p>
<p> 12<font style="font-style: italic;">:code</font>  Non-taxable 
 elective salary deferrals to various retirement plans.</p>
<p>  For the 2009 taxes, these would be codes E-J, S, and Y (taxable???).</p>
<p style="margin-left: 72.00pt;">401(k) Note: it is not necessary to specify 
 your 401(k) deduction in this manner as it is handled as a special deduction 
 type.</p>
<p> 12:<font style="font-style: italic;">code</font> After tax 
 contributions to Roth retirement plans</p>
<p>  For the 2009 taxes, these would be codes AA and BB.</p>
<p> 14:<font style="font-style: italic;">label</font> The preferred 
 functionality for Box 14 is implemented by entering SDI in the</p>
<p style="margin-left: 72.00pt;">Tax Table User 1 field or the Tax Authority 
 1 field). This overrides its implementation in an Earnings or Deduction 
 record.</p>
<p><font style="font-weight: bold;">Deductions  <span>User1-5:</span></font><br/>
These optional fields may be used for information your company wishes to 
 retain and for payroll setup.</p>
<p style="margin-left: 48px;"><span style="font-weight: bold;">Canadian 
 Installations:</span>  In order for Union Dues and Charitable Deductions 
 to correctly print on the T4, the user must populate the field ‘Deduction 
 User 1’ with Dues or Charitable, respectively, and ensure that the Deduction 
 Type is Other Pre-Tax.</p>
<p style="margin-left: 36.00pt;"><font style="font-weight: bold;">Tip: 
 Dependent Care Benefits - US:<br/>
</font>Dependent Care Benefits (Box 10) has been implemented for W-2 reporting. 
 You must set User 1 field in the appropriate Deduction Record to 
 DC.</p>
<p style="font-weight: bold;">Disposable Income:</p>
<p>These fields allow you to refine<span style="font-weight: bold;"> </span>disposable 
 pay garnishment calculations for US and Canadian Payroll users where the 
 garnishment is a percentage of disposable pay. These are now based on 
 the settings of the new Disposable Income fields in the Deductions record. 
  Note that the Disposable Limit must be set on the <a href="../../../../../Employee_Deductions_Tab.htm#Disposable_Limit:">Employee 
 Deductions tab</a>: if this field is blank for a garnishment deduction, 
 payroll taxes will NOT be deducted before the garnishment is assessed.</p>
<p style="margin-left: 48px;"><span style="font-weight: bold;">Statutory? 
 (set only for mandatory non-garnishments)</span><br/>
This field would only be checked if this non-garnishment deduction is a 
 mandatory (not voluntary) deduction. For example, Health Insurance or 
 involuntary retirement or pension contributions would be Statutory in 
 the US. In Canada, Canadian Pension Plan and Union Dues would be considered 
 Statutory. </p>
<p style="margin-left: 48px;"><span style="font-weight: bold;">Non-Statutory? 
 (set only for voluntary non-garnishments)</span><br/>
 All voluntary, non-garnishment deductions. For example most 401K contributions 
 (US), loan repayments, and uniform type deductions.  </p>
<p style="margin-left: 48px;"><span style="font-weight: bold;">Allow Statutory? 
 (set only for garnishments based on current regulations)</span><br/>
 This field would be checked if this is a garnishment type deduction (e.g., 
 child support) AND that Statutory Deduction should be applied to the disposable 
 pay for this garnishment. </p>
<p style="margin-left: 48px;"><span style="font-weight: bold;">Allow Non-Statutory? 
 (set only for garnishments based on current regulations)</span><br/>
This field would be checked if this is a garnishment type deduction (e.g., 
 child support) AND that Non Statutory Deductions should be applied to 
 the disposable pay for this garnishment. </p>
<p style="margin-left: 88px; text-decoration: underline; ">Validation:</p>
<p style="margin-left: 88px;">Deductions CAN be marked as either Statutory 
 or Non-Statutory (but not both) <br/>
Deductions CAN be marked as Allow Statutory, Allow Non-Statutory or both 
 <br/>
Deductions can NOT be marked as both (Statutory or Non-Statutory) &amp; 
 (Allow Statutory or Allow Non-Statutory). In other words, if you mark 
 one of the top two you are not allowed to mark one or both of the bottom 
 two, or vice versa. </p>
<p><font style="font-weight: bold;">Obsolete</font><font style="font-weight: bold;">?</font><font style="font-weight: bold;"><br/>
</font>If this field is checked, the record is considered Obsolete, and 
 it may not be directly specified during data-entry (either by entering 
 the Id or selecting it from a list). Obsoleted records can be edited and 
 the Obsolete option can be un-done when necessary. When you check the 
 Obsolete field, the following message box will be displayed:</p>
<p style="margin-left: 36.00pt;">“You have elected to obsolete this record. 
 Would you like to see existing references to this record?”</p>
<p>If you click Yes, the system will display a viewer that provides click-through 
 access to all tables referencing this record: see <a href="References_List.htm">References 
 List</a> for details.</p>
