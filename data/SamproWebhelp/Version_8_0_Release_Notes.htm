<h1>Version 8.0 Release Notes Version 8.0.510.058</h1>
<p>If you were already on Version 8.0, click <a href="Version_8_0_Release_Notes.htm#Version_8.0_Recent_Updates">Version 8.0 Recent Updates and Enhancements</a> for a brief synopsis of the most recent changes to this version. If you have just updated to Version 8.0, be sure to review all of the release notes.</p>
<h1>1 System</h1>
<p>Performance enhancement when data is being retrieved.&#160;</p>
<p><font style="font-weight: bold;">XMLToPDF Processing:</font> Corrects a sporadic problem with source file paths containing spaces when creating PDFs.</p>
<p style="margin-left: 6.50pt; margin-right: 1.50pt;"><font style="font-weight: bold;">New</font> <font style="font-weight: bold;">XMLToPDF.jar file:</font> The file dated 11/06/2013 or later checks and deletes temp files generated when a SAMPro e-mail with no .pdf attachment is sent. This file also better supports scheduled report emailing, and emailing SAMPro viewer lists.</p>
<p><font style="font-weight: bold;">Important Installation Note</font><font style="font-weight: bold;">:</font> The zip file for this release includes a file containing all bitmap definitions in the image (master~pushbuttons.obj) and an executable image (v.exe) stripped of all bitmaps. The bitmaps will be loaded at runtime from the master~pushbuttons.obj file and the SKIN1 directory (if bitmap skinning is in effect). Running this release requires the presence of the change.log, recover.log and master~pushbuttons.obj files in the same directory as the image (v.exe) file.</p>
<p><font style="font-weight: bold;">Important</font> <font style="font-weight: bold;">Note on Colors:</font> In order to fully support Bitmap Skinning, users’ computer display settings must be set to 24 or 32 bit color. If the Color Quality is set to 16 bit (High Color in Windows 7), the bitmaps will appear with their standard, pale gray background, but the registry-defined background and mouse over color changes will not appear. Setting the Color Quality to 24 or 32 bit should provide the full bitmap skinning functionality.</p>
<h2>1.1 Updated/New Reports</h2>
<h3>1.1.1 Report Asset Profitability (RASSTPRFTBLY.rpt)</h3>
<p>This report compares Earned Revenue with Overhead Costs for the time period the user selects to calculate the Asset Profitability and Asset Cost/Hour for each Asset on the report, as well as a report total profitability.</p>
<p><font style="font-weight: bold;">Report Description:</font></p>

<h3>1.1.2 Asset Usage (RASSTUSGE.rpt)</h3>
<p>This report provides Overhead and Distributed usage for the time period the user selects.</p>
<p><font style="font-weight: bold;">Report Description:</font></p>

<h3>1.1.3 Report Customer Statement (RCUSTSTMNT.rpt)</h3>
<p>The Customer Statement report (RCUSTSTMNT.rpt) dated 8/30/2011 or later supports auto-emailing. If an e-mail address exists in the Client Collections Email Address field, a copy of their section of the report will be emailed to that address. In addition to installing the updated report, the following registry options must be added to the sys-report-rcuststmnt registry to enable this behavior.</p>
<p><font style="font-weight: bold;">Setting Key:</font> emailbysection <font style="font-weight: bold;">Setting Value:</font> true</p>
<p><font style="font-weight: bold;">Setting Key:</font> autoemail <font style="font-weight: bold;">Setting Value:</font> true</p>
<h3>1.1.4 Service Billing Worksheet</h3>
<p>The Service Billing Worksheet report has been modified to display a very noticeable warning for each WO/Job invoice that would result in a template-type client being billed for any amount other than zero. The Service Worksheet report (SERVICEWORKSHEETv73b032.rpt dated 11/22/2011) must be imported to support this functionality. See user note 5.2.1 for additional details.</p>
<p>The Service Worksheet report (SERVICEWORKSHEETv73b032.rpt dated 8/8/2012) has been enhanced to include a Total Revenue Plus Tax field just below the Total Tax.</p>
<p>The Service Billing Worksheet Report (SERVICEWORKSHEETv80b017.rpt) dated 1/28/2013 supports enhanced text box handling which allows the entire contents of the 3000 character Work Order Work Performed and Work Order Work Requested to print. This enhancement also allows the contents of these text box fields to be split between pages.</p>
<p>The Service Billing Worksheet (SERVICEWORKSHEETv80b017.rpt) dated 4/19/2013 supports a new option, Equipment Detail. When set to On, the Equipment Name and Serial Number will be printed on the Worksheet following the Work Requested. By default, this option is set to Off.</p>
<h3>1.1.5 Revised Report W2 Electronic Files</h3>
<p><font style="font-weight: bold;">Report W2</font> <font style="font-weight: bold;">Electronic File (RW2EF.rpt) (02/21/2012</font><font style="font-weight: bold;">)</font></p>
<p>In this version, a registry entry is now <font style="font-weight: bold;">required t</font>o set Position 174 on the RE line as the default has been changed to blank to accommodate special processing for the state of Maryland. The following option is now required for federal processing with this report.</p>
<p><font style="font-weight: bold;">Id: sys-w2-ef</font></p>
<p><font style="font-weight: bold;">Setting Key:</font> reEmployerKind&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;<font style="font-weight: bold;">Setting Value:</font> N</p>
<p>This entry is REQUIRED for federal processing; the value will default to blank if no entry is made.</p>
<p><font style="font-weight: bold;">Most companies will use a Setting Value of N</font>; if your organization is tax exempt or a government agency, see the following for other options:</p>
<p style="margin-left: 36.00pt;">F – Federal Government</p>
<p style="margin-left: 36.00pt;">S- State and Local Government</p>
<p style="margin-left: 36.00pt;">T – Tax exempt Employer</p>
<p style="margin-left: 36.00pt;">Y – State and Local Tax Exempt Employer</p>
<p style="margin-left: 36.00pt;">N – None Apply</p>
<p>The Audit Report option of Report W2 Electronic File (report RW2EF.rpt dated 2/21/2012) has been modified so that the totals row is offset so that larger payroll amounts do not overlap. This change impacts the Audit option only. This report is suitable for version 7.2 and up.</p>
<h3>1.1.6 Drill Down AP Aging:</h3>
<p>The updated report (DAPVAGEv73b033.rpt dated 2/28/2012) corrects a problem that only occurred if you ran this report with the Invoice Detail option set to Yes. Previously, this resulted in the associated drill-down displaying the incorrect Vendor Name; this has been corrected.</p>
<h3>1.1.7&#160;AIA Report with Retainage</h3>
<p>A new report, RAIA-R.rpt, calculates retainage (shows the % instead of N/A) on G702 form (1st page) and has subtotals for billing items and change orders on G703 form (pages &gt;1). Note that this report also supports the sectionkeyvalue functionality described above.</p>
<p><font style="font-weight: bold;">If you want to use this new report INSTEAD of RAIA.rpt, you will need to:</font></p>
<p style="margin-left: 36.00pt;">1. Install the report.</p>
<p style="margin-left: 36.00pt;">2. Point the Report Id in the User Defined Functions (for the CM, Owner and Architect) to RAIA-R.rpt instead of RAIA.rpt</p>
<p style="margin-left: 36.00pt;">3. Install the Standard Construction Bitmaps in the standard_construction_03082012.zip in appropriate bitmaps directory. These bitmaps support both RAIA.rpt and RAIA-R.rpt, and do not require x / y placement modifiers.</p>
<p><font style="font-weight: bold;">If you want to be able to run both RAIA.rpt and RAIA-R.rpt</font></p>
<p style="margin-left: 36.00pt;">1. Install the report.</p>
<p style="margin-left: 36.00pt;">2. Create three new, unique User-Defined Functions (for the CM, Owner and Architect) for RAIA-R.rpt:</p>
<p style="margin-left: 36.00pt;">Function Id: RAIA-R_owner&#160;<br />
Report Id: RAIA-R Menu Category: Report</p>
<p style="margin-left: 36.00pt;">Function Id: RAIA-R_architect&#160;<br />
Report Id: RAIA-R Menu Category: Report</p>
<p style="margin-left: 36.00pt;">Function Id: RAIA-R_cm<br />
Report Id: RAIA-R Menu Category: Report</p>
<p style="margin-left: 36.00pt;">3. Create three new, unique registry settings to specify th``e bitmaps for the CM, Owner and Architect for the RAIA-R.rpt, each with the applicable bitmap, bitmap backer and autosave (if desired) entries:</p>
<p style="margin-left: 36.00pt;"><font style="font-weight: bold;">Registry Id:</font> sys-report-RAIA-R_owner<br />
<font style="font-weight: bold;">Registry Id:</font> sys-report-RAIA-R_architect&#160;<br />
<font style="font-weight: bold;">Registry Id:</font> sys-report-RAIA-R_cm</p>
<p style="margin-left: 36.00pt;">4. Install the Standard Construction Bitmaps in the standard_construction_03082012.zip (available from your support rep) in appropriate bitmaps directory. These bitmaps support both RAIA.rpt and RAIA-R.rpt, and do not require x / y placement modifiers.</p>
<p style="margin-left: 36.00pt;">5. Add the appropriate links to the Folders viewer.</p>
<h3>1.1.8 Employee Paid Time Off Report 2 (RPREPTO2v73b041.rpt)</h3>
<p>This report was designed for our Canadian payroll users. The report breaks out PTO by employee. The check boxes on the input screen Show Vacation, Show Sick, Show Holiday &amp; Show Other determine the pay type categories which are to be included on the report. Each of these pay type categories is broken out by section for each employee.</p>
<p>This report includes the following columns:</p>
<p>Pay Period Id - Date - Pay Type - Current Period Accruals – Accrued $ – Used $ – Balance – Hours Used</p>
<p>The report is sorted by date. Totals of the Accrued, Used and Balance column allow for a cross check to the totals being printed on the employee cheque. This report is suitable for version 7.3.496.041 and above.</p>
<h3>1.1.9 Quote (RQTEFRMv73b102.rpt)</h3>
<p>The standard Quote form dated 5/4/2012 supports enhanced text box handling which allows the contents of the Scope text (including Scope Notes) to be split between pages. This allows quote scope text (including notes) to exceed one page in length. This revision also includes a new checkbox, Omit Approved Options that may be flagged to omit Approved scope options from the printed Quote and Quote total. See user note 2.21 for a registry option to flag the Omit Approved Options.</p>
<p>When document archiving is turned on, and quotes are set to autosavewhenprinted or autosave in the sys-report-rqtefrm registry, the Report Quote Form (RQTEFRMv73b102.rpt dated 8/7/2012) will be correctly archived and attached to the Quote record.</p>
<p>The Report Quote Form (RQTEFRMv73b102.rpt dated 8/23/2012) now includes the Quote Id above the page number on all pages of the quote.</p>
<p>The quote report RQTEFRMv73b102.rpt dated 1/14/2013 includes the price fields expanded to handle amounts up to 99,999,999.99. Changes to ensure total amount fields are in alignment have also been made.</p>
<p>The quote report RQTEFRMv73b102.rpt dated 7/11/2013 supports the printing of quote options with leading blanks, and correctly associates detail lines with them. It also supports the rounding of Revenue amounts so the Quote viewer and standard report match.</p>
<p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">&#160;</p>
<h3>1.1.10 Report Job Account Manager GM Report (RJBGMRPRT.rpt)</h3>
<p>In the updated report dated 5/1/2012, sales tax has been removed from the calculation of Amount Invoiced and Gross Margin.</p>
<h3>1.1.11 Report Bank Reconciliation (RBKRECN.rpt)</h3>
<p>The version of this report dated 5/31/2012 has been enhanced to warn the user if any transactions were saved with an un-reconciled balance. The following message will appear on the report:</p>
<p style="margin-left: 36.00pt;">*** WARNING – THE FOLLOWING TRANSACTIONS WERE SAVED WITH UNRECONCILED BALANCES ***</p>
<p>The message will be followed by the Transaction Id, Description, and Un-reconciled Balance of the transaction.</p>
<h3>1.1.12 Report PR Time</h3>
<p>Report RPRTIMEv73b021.rpt dated 8/10/2012 corrects a problem where page breaks were inserted when the employee Id changed. In this version, multiple employees may appear on the same page.</p>
<h3>1.1.13 New Report: Report Change Order (RCOv73b016.rpt)</h3>
<p>This report is designed to be run from the Quote viewer to produce a Change Order document for construction type jobs. It closely resembles the standard quote form, but with labeled as “Change Order” instead of Quote. Most users will be able to use their ‘header’ or ‘general’ bitmap with this report.</p>
<p>The Change Order report RCOv73b102.rpt dated 1/14/2013 includes the price fields expanded to handle amounts up to 99,999,999.99. Total amount fields are correctly aligned.</p>
<h3>1.1.14 Next Invoice Amount Handling</h3>
<p>The following reports updated 9/24/2012 provide improved handling for the Next Invoice amount and should be installed in your database:</p>

<p style="margin-left: 36.00pt;"><font style="font-weight: bold;">Report Profitability Analysis (RPRFTRPT.rpt)<br /></font>Revised on 11/01/2012 so that it correctly picks revenue when a pm is fully earned when invoiced.</p>

<h3>1.1.15 New Report: Payroll Period (RPYRLLPRDRPRT.rpt)</h3>
<p>This report may be used to quickly scan the contents of a range of Payroll Periods to verify their fields (including Start and End dates, and the Year) are completed correctly.</p>
<h3>1.1.16 New Report: Earnings Group Report Period (RERNNGSGRTRPRT.rpt)</h3>
<p>This report may be used to quickly scan the contents of one or more earnings groups for the Report Date that you enter to ensure that the Earnings and Rates applicable to this date have been entered correctly. Filtering by Earnings Group Id, Union Id, and Union Class Id are supported. By default, the Obsolete range is set to N so that only active Earnings Groups appear.</p>
<p style="margin-left: 36.00pt;">For each Earnings Group, all Earnings lines with a Start - End Date range which includes the Report Date will be printed, including the following information:</p>
<p style="margin-left: 36.00pt;">Earnings Id: Amount: Start Date:&#160;Add Pay Rate Factor: Taxable: JobCost Labor Entry:</p>
<p style="margin-left: 36.00pt;">Cost Category: Amount Type: End Date: Earnings Type: Accrue: JobCost PR Check:</p>
<p style="margin-left: 36.00pt;">This report is valid for versions 7.2 and up.</p>
<h3>1.1.17 New Report: Report Vendor Payment History (use for Vendor 1096)</h3>
<p>This new report (RVNDRPYMNTS.rpt) dated 01/15/2013 may be imported and run to assist with the completion of the Federal Form 1096 which summarizes the 1099 Vendor forms for that year. The Vendor Limit should be currently be set to $500 to conform to the 1099 requirements. The Start and End Dates should specify the calendar year reported on.</p>
<h3>1.1.18 Report Service Invoice</h3>
<p>The Service Invoice Report (SERVICEINVOICEv80b017.rpt) dated 1/28/2013 supports enhanced text box handling which allows the entire contents of the 3000 character Work Order Work Performed, Work Order Work Requested, Work Order Equipment Work Performed, and Work Order Equipment Work Requested to print. This enhancement also allows the contents of these text box fields to be split between pages.</p>
<h3>1.1.19 PR 401k Report</h3>
<p>We added logic in version 7.3 which resulted in the employee's gross wages being reduced by the amount of any Section 125 deductions before applying the 401`k deduction percentage when the following registry entry is in place:</p>
<p>Registry: sys-compute-payroll</p>
<p>Setting Key: 401KGrossLess125Deductions Setting Value: true</p>
<p>In this release, if the above registry in place, this logic is now also applied to the calculation of the Match column on the 401(k) Report. This is a system report, and does not need to be imported to your database.</p>
<h3>1.1.20 CanadianT4 Report</h3>
<p>This release updates the T4 report to conform to the 2012 T4 form.</p>
<p>Canadian T4's now also use the W2 Category fields in the Deductions &amp; Earnings records to populate the Other Information boxes on the T4. The W2 category must be filled in as OI:(Code # for T4). The Employee User 7 field is used to print the registration number in box 50 on the T4.</p>
<p>This is a system report, and does not need to be imported to your database.</p>
<h3>1.1.21 Report IM Cost of Sales (obsoleted)</h3>
<p>The report processes data posted to IMH and JCH from Shop Orders, Shop Order Transfers, the Shop Order Journal and the AR Sales Journal and was designed. It has an unusual set of requirements: items must be manufactured, items must be reported as sold in the AR Sales Journal (Costs child tab).&#160;Due do the confusion it caused, this report has been obsoleted. If upgrading to this version did not trigger a database conversion, it will be necessary to run Start Function Update to remove it from the list of reports.</p>
<h3>1.1.22 Report PR Verification</h3>
<p>In earlier versions, if this report was run with the PR Period range blank, job history entries not associated with an employee (e.g., WO Other) could be displayed. The Report PR Verification Report (RPRVERI.rpt) dated 4/12/2012 has been <font style="font-weight: bold;">m</font>odified to skip these entries.</p>
<h3>1.1.23 Report PR Check Register</h3>
<p>The Report Check Register (RPRREGR.rpt) dated May 6, 2013 has been updated so that it now prints the check numbers and check date when the Gross Earnings = Net Pay.&#160;</p>
<h3>1.1.24 Report Vendor Invoice</h3>

<h3>1.1.25 Revised Report PR Employee Wage Analysis</h3>
<p>The revised report RPRWAGE.rpt dated 7/19/2013 has been enhanced to support Canadian installations by using the SIN (along with the US SSN) when grouping / sorting the report.</p>
<h3>1.1.26 Reorder Advice Report:</h3>
<p><font style="font-weight: bold;">New Field</font> <font style="font-weight: bold;">- Restrict to Location</font> <font style="font-weight: bold;">Filter</font> <font style="font-weight: bold;">Only</font><font style="font-weight: bold;">?<br /></font>If you check this field the items on this report will be restricted to those needed at locations defined by the Location Id: range. Other stock locations that have the item available for possible transfer will NOT appear on the report if this box is checked.</p>
<p>Note that this is a system report and does NOT need to be imported into your database.</p>
<h3>1.1.27 W2 Processing for Medicare Additional Tax</h3>
<p>This build supports correct W2 processing of Medicare Additional Tax (specified in the FICA MCAD tax table) which may have been assessed on employees earning more than 200,000 in 2013. In previous releases, the W2 FICA Medicare totals would have only included amounts entered on the FICA MC tax table; in this release, W2’s include amounts from both the FICA MC AND the FICA MCAD tables.</p>
<h3>1.1.28 Report PR Federal Tax (RPRTAXF.rpt)</h3>
<p>The revised report dated 1/20/2014 now supports Medicare Additional Tax for high wage workers.</p>
<h3>1.1.28 Report PR 941 Quarterly Summary (RPR941S.rpt)</h3>
<p>The revised report dated 10/18/2013 or later supports Medicare Additional Tax for high wage workers. The current version of this report may already have been installed in your database.</p>
<h3>1.1.29 Report PR Certified PR</h3>
<p style="margin-left: 8px;">The Certified PR Report (RPRCRPR.rpt) dated 2/21/14 has been modified to better support fringe calculations. &#160;</p>
<p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">&#160;</p>
<h3>1.1.30 Report PR Worksheet (RPRWRKSv73b041.rpt) (U.S. Payroll)</h3>
<p class="MsoNormal">The Additional Medicare Tax statute requires U.S. employers to withhold Additional Medicare Tax on wages it pays to an employee in excess of $200,000 in a calendar year. For SAMPro users, this requires adding the FICA MCAD Tax Table to an Employee's Tax tab when he/she is projected to exceed $200,000 in the next payroll (NOT before).</p>
<p class="MsoNormal">The revised PR Worksheet report (dated 06/04/2014) includes a new input field, FICA MC Wage Threshold. &#160;When this field is completed, the following warning will appear in the report in red, bold text if the threshold is exceeded:</p>
<p class="Support">*** YTD FICA MC WAGES OF $ (employee's wages) HAVE EXCEEDED THE WAGE THRESHOLD of $ (value entered on input field) ***</p>
<p class="MsoNormal">Remember, the <span style="font-family: Arial, sans-serif;">table FICA MCAD should not be added to the Employee's Tax Tab UNTIL the employee is going to breach the 200K threshold.</span> This report is suitable for version 7.3 and above.</p>
<p class="MsoNormal">A registry setting may be used to set the report's FICA MC Wage Threshold input field to either the $200,000 or a lesser value (to provide a warning before the next paycheck or bonus is generated). &#160;</p>
<p class="MsoNormal"><span style="font-weight: bold;">Registry Id:</span> sys-report-rprwrks</p>
<p class="MsoNormal"><span style="font-weight: bold;">Setting Key:</span> InitialValueFor~p_fica_wge_thrshhld &#160;&#160;<span style="font-weight: bold;">Setting Value:</span> <span style="font-style: italic;"><i>threshold amount</i></span></p>
<p class="MsoNormal">This Setting Value should be set to the default threshold amount for the report. For example,</p>
<p class="MsoNormal" style="margin-left: 48px;">Setting Value: 180000 &#160;(to display the warning BEFORE computed pay exceeds the US government threshold)</p>
<p class="MsoNormal" style="margin-left: 48px;">Setting Value: 200000 &#160;(to display when computed pay exceeds the US government threshold)</p>
<h3>1.1.31 Report AP Vendor History</h3>
<p class="MsoNormal" style="margin-left: 8px;">A new range field, Invoice Date, has been added the system Report AP Vendor History. This range enables the user to filter data based on the Vendor Invoice Date.</p>
<h2>1.2 Expanded VM</h2>
<p>SAMPro’s Smalltalk virtual memory has been expanded to 600MB to better accommodate the running of extremely long reports and the unfiltered display of history viewers.</p>
<h2>1.3 Viewers (general)</h2>
<p>Corrects a sporadic 'key is missing' error that could occur if the column compression limit was exceeded on very long double-click lists, and the user then clicked the All button, Find Data, and finally the List button.</p>
<p>This release eliminates ‘Receiver is not a boolean’ errors that occurred when clicking the Cancel (or X close) button of a warning box that appeared when leaving a record without saving changes.</p>
<p>New code reduces/eliminates 'system primitive failed' errors.</p>
<p>The list display has been corrected so that if horizontal lines are disabled via registry, the graybar/numbers end with the last record.</p>
<p>Previously, named global ranges (prefixed by a *) for viewers and reports could only be deleted by the user that created them. If that user left the firm, the range could not be deleted. In this release, users flagged as a Notes Administrator may delete global ranges defined by other users. Note that ranges are deleted by double-clicking and answering Yes to Remove Selected Range prompt.</p>
<p>Improvements to the trapping and reporting of ODBC/connectivity issues, such as the ‘Unknown User’ error.</p>
<p>This release corrects a sporadic problem where SAMPro did not always select the correct record when switching between the list and record views if a hyphen was included in the record id.</p>
<p>This release corrects an obscure problem deleting records opened via right-click. See case for details.</p>
<p>More efficient right-click open of viewers implemented.</p>
<p>In this release, History record viewers will start at the Range screen to avoid the unnecessary load time need to display the entire list of entries. In previous releases, the registry entry sys-startscreen-filter was required to implement this functionality.</p>
<p>This release eliminates a sporadic problem where the Change Record message displayed twice when leaving a record without saving your changes.</p>
<p>This release corrects a problem where the wrong sidebar appeared when the Refresh button was clicked in the Client Site Equipment and Job Billing Item viewers</p>
<p>The error ‘Not enough storage is available to process this command. ( OS error 16r8 )’ may occur if the user’s systems do not support the bitmap cloning associated with the new skins. In this release, bitmap cloning is disabled when the 'sys-gui' registry not available, a Skin Id is not specified, and when logging in as the support user. Note that the User’s Registry Tab may be used to turn skinning off or on by user.</p>
<p>In previous releases, the mouse over box drawn around bitmaps was not always removed when the mouse was quickly run over a series of buttons. This problem has been corrected so that these “leftover” boxes no longer appear when the mouse has moved off of the button.</p>
<p>This release extends the ability to successfully create a named range to history viewers opened at the filter screen.</p>
<h3>1.3.1 Notes</h3>
<p>This release corrects spurious "Change Record?" and "You cannot change the record" messages when using the Next/Previous buttons to scroll through regular Notes records.</p>
<p>This release corrects a problem pasting text with embedded spaces which resulted in the note text not being saved. This release also eliminates the pipe symbol from text being pasted (Ctrl+v) into the body of a note (anything following the pipe | is not retained after saving and reopening the Note).</p>
<p style="margin-left: 36.00pt;"><font style="font-weight: bold;">Important:</font> the menu function Edit&gt;Paste does NOT support this fix. Always use Ctrl+v to paste into the Notes body, NOT Edit&gt;Paste.</p>
<p>The detail text is now cleared when you click the New button from an existing Note. In previous releases, the Note header was cleared / updated, but the detail text from the previous Note was not cleared.</p>
<p>If a user (not a notes administrator) accessed a private note created by someone else, and attempted to change it, the message “you cannot change the record because the change button is disabled” would appear and the user would be unable to exit SAMPro correctly. In this release, the message appears, but the user is allowed to close the notes viewer.</p>
<p><font style="font-weight: bold;">Setting Viewer Attributes for Notes:<br /></font> The Save Viewer Attributes of the File Menu may be used to save the Size and Position of open viewer. If you are doing so for the Notes viewer, you must log off and on again to see the results.</p>
<p><font style="font-weight: bold;">Tip: Resetting Viewer Attributes<br /></font>To reset Viewer Attributes, first select File=&gt;Set Viewer Attributes, clear the check boxes, and click OK. Next, reset them by selecting File=&gt;Set Viewer Attributes, and checking the appropriate boxes.</p>
<h3>1.3.2 Status Pane</h3>
<p>The Status Pane now shows the field the Mouse Pointer is over or the field with focus if the mouse cursor is not over a button or field. For example, if the mouse is over the Add line button, the Status line displays:</p>
<p style="margin-left: 36.00pt;">PointerOver&gt;&gt;&gt;AddLine: Click or press ctrl+O to add a new line of data</p>
<p>The status pane text is based on the field in focus if the mouse cursor is not over a field or button:</p>
<p style="margin-left: 36.00pt;">InFocus&gt;&gt;&gt;(1:15)clntsteeqmnt_id</p>
<h3>1.3.4 New Help Menu Option - SQL History:</h3>
<p>There may be times when your support representative needs to see the SQL generated by certain actions: the SQL History option has been added to the Help menu to enable this.</p>
<p><font style="font-weight: bold;">To capture SQL History</font><font style="font-weight: bold;">:</font></p>
<p style="margin-left: 36.00pt;">Select Help &gt; SQL History. This menu provides three options: Capture SQL History, View SQLHistory and Clear SQL History. If a check mark does not yet appear next to Capture SQL History select this option to turn this feature on. Next, perform the steps that your support representation tells you.</p>
<p><font style="font-weight: bold;">To View SQL History:</font></p>
<p style="margin-left: 36.00pt;">Use the menu option Help&gt;SQL History&gt;View SQL History</p>
<p style="margin-left: 36.00pt;">A workspace window will appear with the SQL history that has been logged. In the workspace with, select File &gt; Save As. A browser window will appear: browse to a location you will be able to retrieve the file from, and save it using a appropriate name.</p>
<p><font style="font-weight: bold;">To Clear SQL History:</font></p>
<p style="margin-left: 36.00pt;">The Help&gt;Clear SQL History option may be used to clear SQL history before making another test.</p>
<p><font style="font-weight: bold;">To Turn Off SQL History:</font></p>
<p style="margin-left: 36.00pt;">It a check mark appears next to the Capture SQL History menu option, is it toggled on. To toggle Capture SQL History off, select Help&gt;SQL History&gt; Capture SQL History. Note that even if you do not explicitly turn this feature off, it will be disabled when you log off.</p>
<h3>1.3.4 Windows Menu</h3>
<p>Previously, SAMPro’s Windows menu did not list the TechFinder window. In this release, a TechFinder entry is added to the Windows menu when a TechFinder window is opened, and removed when the window is closed.</p>
<h3>1.3.5 Type-Ahead/Autosearch Enhancement</h3>
<p>The 'Type-Ahead' feature allows the user to position the caret to a specific row of a list just by typing the first few characters of the desired row. In previous versions, this only worked only on first column of the list. This release extends this functionality so that it works on whatever the column the cursor is positioned in IF the target column has been pre-sorted in ascending order by clicking the column header of the desired column.<br />
<br />
For example:</p>
<p>&#160;&#160;1) the user sorts column three in ascending order<br />
&#160;&#160;2) the user positions the cursor at the first character in column three<br />
&#160;&#160;3) the user types the characters b, o, and b.<br />
&#160;&#160;4) the cursor will automatically positioned on the forth character of the first line having column three beginning with 'bob'.</p>
<h3>1.3.6 Record Validation (WO Inventory and other journals)</h3>
<p>This release implements enhanced journal validation logic to prevent sporadic posting reversals with inappropriate Transaction Ids. If this situation is about to occur, the erroneous reversal is suppressed AND an error is written to the error log noting the reversal suppression.</p>
<h3>1.3.7 Viewers (general) / New Call</h3>
<p>Corrects an error 8114 experienced by MSSQL database users when right-clicking the Web Log Id in New Call (and possibly other areas).</p>
<h3>1.3.8 Logging On</h3>
<p>The file master~pushbuttons.obj file must be located in the same directory as the image file, v.exe. This release improves the error if starting an image without the bitmap object file: “Warning: SAMPRO’s bitmap file (master~pushbuttons.obj file) is either missing or corrupted. Contact your Support Representative.”</p>
<h3>1.3.9 Email Pager Label</h3>
<p>The label, Email Pager, has been changed to Email Address 2 in the following records:</p>
<p style="margin-left: 36.00pt;">Account Manager<br />
Client<br />
Client Site<br />
Contact<br />
Dispatcher<br />
Sales Rep<br />
Service Account Manager<br />
Technician<br />
User<br />
Vendor.</p>
<p>This change only impacts the label - the field names/functionality has not changed. The Custom Fields functionality may be used to change the label back to its previous form.</p>
<h3>1.3.10 New Record button</h3>
<p>This release corrects a problem that could occur in journals with detail child tabs displaying the Magnify button. Specifically, if a user did not click Add to create a new record but instead clicked the New record button, and answered Yes to the save changes, it could result in problems such as a manual sales journal entry being saved with an invoice total header amount but no corresponding amount on the Prices tab.</p>
<p>In this release, when you click the New record button with unsaved changes, the system will display the following message:</p>
<p style="margin-left: 36.00pt;">Warning: the changes made to the current record has not been saved.<br />
Do you wish to return to save your changes?</p>
<p>If you click Yes, you will be returned to the record you were editing to Add or Save it.<br />
If you click No, your changes will be discarded, and a new record form will appear.</p>
<h3>1.3.11 Report Preview</h3>
<p>This release includes improved handling of 'index is outside of collection bounds' errors which sometimes appeared if the ReportAutoScroll registry setting was enabled and the user scrolled through the report very rapidly.</p>
<p><font style="font-weight: bold;">New Report Comments Enhancement</font></p>
<p>Functionality added to this version may be used to enable the user to add his or her comments to a report in the DB Report viewer. Currently, report comments are limited the Service Billing Worksheet (SERVICEWORKSHEETv80b107.rpt) and to a custom report, but can be added to other reports as needed.</p>
<p>&#160;<img src="image/SKIN1_AddComments.gif" alt="image\SKIN1_AddComments.gif" title="image\SKIN1_AddComments.gif" width="94" height="28" border="0" /><br />
If Report Comments are supported within a report, the Add Comments button will appear in the left-hand button bar of the DB Report Viewer. If they are not supported, the grayed-out version of the button will appear.</p>
<p>To add your comments to the displayed page of the report, click Add Comments to the Enter Page Comment box will appear. Enter your remarks in the Page Comment field, and then click OK; a maximum of 5 lines of 50 characters is supported. The box will close, and your comments will preview on the report screen; simply click Add Comment again to revise your Comments. To add comments to other pages, simply display that page, and click Add Comment button.</p>
<p>The comments you entered will appear on the report when you print, email or save it.</p>
<h3>1.3.12 SAMPro Email Form</h3>
<p><font style="font-weight: bold;">New Option: Email Current Section Only</font></p>
<p>This new field will appear if the report to be emailed supports section key logic, and more than one section appears in the previewed report. If you flag this field, only the current section of the report will be sent. If this field remains blank, the entire report will be sent. The following standard reports support section key logic:</p>
<p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">&#160;</p>

<h3>1.3.13 Required Field Processing</h3>
<p>The registry entries (requiredFieldsChild) that allow child tab fields to be defined as required have been enhanced so the all lines are checked for the required field when the record is saved, not just the one the user was ‘on’. In addition, the message alerting the user to an empty required field on a child tab now includes the tab label.</p>
<h3>1.3.14 Switch Database</h3>
<p>A new option, Switch DataBase, has been added to the File menu. When selected, all viewers will be closed and the Login form will reappear. Since the image itself remains loaded, users with multiple databases to switch between them more quickly.</p>
<p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">&#160;</p>
<h2>1.4 Startme.exe</h2>
<p>This release includes a new startme.exe file. When the first user (of a particular OS) accesses a new image, the underscore version of the v.exe runtime will be generated with the user’s OS designation. For example, if you have XP and Windows 7 users, you would expect to see two runtime images:</p>
<p>V_2011_9_16_12_13__18_[Microsoft_Windows_XP].exe and</p>
<p>V_2011_9_16_12_13__18_[Microsoft_Windows_7_Professional].exe</p>
<p>XP users will be directed to the XP runtime, and Windows 7 Professional users will be access the Windows 7 runtime.</p>
<h2>1.5 Start View DB Reports</h2>
<p>This release corrects a 262 error encountered by MS SQL Server users. This release also clarifies other messages generated by this viewer, and adds a progress indicator that appears while the list of reports is being compiled.</p>
<p>In this function, path names were previously restricted to 60 characters, resulting in some reports with lengthy titles/paths not being viewable. The maximum size has been changed to 160 characters. This release also corrects an SQL Server issue with the size of the time field in the temp table.</p>
<h2>1.6 Email</h2>
<p>This release adds a 'Date:' header line to email messages to support email servers that require it. An updated version of the XmlToPdf.jar file is included in the zip file for this release that also supports the Date header line for emails with .PDF attachments sent from SAMPro.</p>
<p>See user release note 2.16 for registry options to implement an alternate port and/or secure server.</p>
<h2>1.7 Printer Selection</h2>
<p>Previously, an error was generated when the user tried to print to certain unusable printers on SAMPro’s printer list. In this release, unusable printers no longer appear on the list.</p>
<h2>1.8 User Groups and Functions</h2>
<p>The standard Check viewer now allows entry for initial check entry. After the initial checks have been loaded in new systems, and for existing systems, all User Groups and Functions records should be updated as follows:</p>
<p>For User Groups allowed to View Checks:</p>
<p style="margin-left: 36.00pt;">Access box checked: Add, Change, Delete and Export boxes cleared.</p>
<p>For User Groups that should NOT View Checks:</p>
<p style="margin-left: 36.00pt;">Access, Add, Change, Delete and Export boxes cleared.</p>
<p>A registry entry (see user note 2.10) is also available to disable all fields in the Check viewer.</p>
<h2>1.9 Report Output Names</h2>
<p>This release corrects a problem that could occur when SAMPro builds a file name which contains characters that not be allowable for windows file names (*/\:?"&gt;&lt;). SAMPro now replaces the illegal windows filename character with an underscore. For example, if the Client Id is Star*Pro, a Statement for January 15, 2012 could be constructed as Star_Pro_20120115.dbr.</p>
<h2>1.10 Custom Index</h2>
<p><font style="font-weight: bold;">New Field: Description</font></p>
<p>This 400 character field should be used to document the need for / purpose of this index.</p>
<p><font style="font-weight: bold;">New Field: Reference</font></p>
<p>This field may be used to cross-reference the index to a specific D-B WO# or Case#.</p>
<h2>1.11 Document Management</h2>
<p>In this release, the Show Document button successfully checks for child subfolders when looking for the OtherFiles tab documents to display.</p>
<p>This release corrects a resource locking issue when attaching documents. In addition, an error will be displayed (and written to the error log) if an archived report fails to be attached to a Document record.</p>
<p>This release restricts Document Filer Processing to XML-type files to avoid erring on extraneous files (such thumbs.db) that may occur in the XML folder.</p>
<p>An improved message appears if the user attempts to show a document before adding the document record: “Document must be added to be available to show.”</p>
<h3>1.11.1 Start Document Archive Maintenance</h3>
<p><font style="font-weight: bold;">New Option: Move to Subfolders?</font></p>
<p>This new option can be used to automatically generate a subfolder structure for your archived documents, resulting in a more manageable number of files in each folder. Documents will be processed beginning with the most recently saved documents which have not yet been moved to a Subfolder.</p>
<p>Checking this new option instructs the Start Document Archive Maintenance function to automatically create subfolders (based on the month and year the document was archived e.g, 2012-06) and then move the archived files from the main document archive folder to the subfolder.</p>
<p><font style="font-weight: bold;">New Option: Convert DBR to PDF?</font></p>
<p>The Convert DBR to PDF option will convert your archived reports from the propriety DBR format to PDF’s. DBR files are not supported in the new DBAnalytics-based web functionality; this option provides a simple way of managing the conversion to PDF’s. Documents will be processed beginning with the most recently saved DBR documents (documents with the greatest Rn) which have not yet been converted to PDF format.When this option is enabled, a copy of the converted DBR files will be placed in the auto-created ConvertedDBRs folder (within the main archive folder). <font style="font-weight: bold;">These files should be backed up/deleted on a regular basis.</font></p>
<p><font style="font-weight: bold;">New Field: Maximum Number of Documents to Process:</font></p>
<p>This required field controls the number of documents that will be processed when this function is run. When using the Move to Subfolders or Convert DBR to PDF for the first time, we recommend limiting the number of files to 5000 and checking the time required to process them.</p>
<h3>1.11.2 Start Document Archive Maintenance (Automated)</h3>
<p>It may be necessary to run Start Function List Update to access this function. It must then be enabled for the applicable User Groups.</p>
<h3>Purpose:</h3>
<p>This function is typically used to automatically generate a subfolder structure for your archived documents, resulting in a more manageable number of files in each folder. Documents will be processed beginning with the most recently saved documents which have not yet been moved to a Subfolder. It can also be used to convert the DBReport files on your system to PDF’s.</p>
<p>This function was designed to be run from the Scheduled Event Manager. Documents will be processed beginning with the most recently saved. Contact your support representative for assistance in setting this up.</p>
<h3>Registry Entries:</h3>
<p>This function runs ‘headless’ (without an initial range screen) using the defaults provided in the required sys-start-sdcmntarchvemntnnce registry (see customer release note 2.25 for details).</p>
<h3>Usage:</h3>
<p>It may take some time for this function to process a large numbers of documents; scheduling it to run at night or during off hours is strongly recommended. &#160;</p>
<p>Before running this function, check the available disk space of the drive on which you are archiving. This is especially important if you will be converting DBReport files to PDFs. When this option is enabled, a copy of the converted DBR files will be placed in the auto-created ConvertedDBRs folder (within the main archive folder). <font style="font-weight: bold;">These files should be backed up/deleted on a regular basis.</font></p>
<h3>1.11.3 Book Viewer</h3>
<h3>Purpose:</h3>
<p>This viewer makes it easier for users to create a "package" of documents that can be easily transmitted to their customers. For example, service invoices along with supporting collateral such as scanned paper work orders or TechAnywhere receipts for a specific customer may be assembled into a .PDF Book and emailed to that customer. Currently, this function supports Invoice related documents as well as any attachments to the work order associated with the invoice.</p>
<p>Invoices for two Clients may be generated from one work order (e.g., Warranty / Non-Warranty). &#160;In this release, only invoices for the Client specified in the Book are auto-filled.</p>
<p>The Book viewer is security-aware based on the Security Id in the Invoice Master Record.</p>
<p>Books were designed to be used for assemble a discrete batch of documents (such as all invoices w/associated collateral for January 2013 for a particular client).</p>
<h3>Registry Entry: Specify Base Directory for PDF Folders</h3>
<p class="Normal_Indent" style="margin-left: 5.75pt;"><font style="font-weight: bold;">Registry Id:</font> sys-viewer-vbk</p>
<p class="Normal_Indent" style="margin-left: 5.75pt;">See the Standard Registry section additional Registry Id formats to allow entries for specific Users, Branches, Security, or User Groups to override the main entry.</p>

<h3>Usage:</h3>
<p style="margin-left: 36.00pt;">1. Complete the required fields on the Main and User fields tab as discussed below.</p>
<p style="margin-left: 36.00pt;">2. On the Select Documents tab, set the Client Id, Start and End Dates, and PDF by Chapters field (if desired). Also complete any desired Range fields.</p>
<p style="margin-left: 72.00pt;"><font style="font-weight: bold;">Tip:</font> The Save Model button lets you save your Chapters, PDF and Ranges settings. The Select a Model button may then be used as a shortcut to setting these fields.</p>
<p style="margin-left: 36.00pt;">3. Click the Autopopulate button to generate the list of documents in the lower section that will be used to create the Book.</p>
<p style="margin-left: 72.00pt;"><font style="font-weight: bold;">Important Note:</font> Workorders Invoiced More than Once<br />
If a Work Order has been invoiced more than once, and one of the invoices falls within the Start and End Date, ALL Invoices and other allowed documents for that Work Order will be included when the Autopopulate button is clicked. The user should carefully review the documents added to the list, and delete the lines for those that do NOT pertain to the selected invoices.</p>
<p style="margin-left: 36.00pt;">4. Add or Save the Book record.</p>
<p style="margin-left: 36.00pt;">5. Click the Make PDF button; the system will generate one or more PDF files consisting of the documents specified below, and display them for you.</p>
<p style="margin-left: 36.00pt;">6. You may email your pdf’s directly from the Adobe Reader windows, or via the Book Viewer’s Email button (which attaches all saved PDF’s for this Book to the email).</p>
<h3>Important Fields: Upper Section</h3>
<p class="Tab" style=" background-color:#e5e5e5; border-top:1.50pt solid #000000; border-bottom:1.50pt solid #000000; border-left:1.50pt solid #000000; border-right:1.50pt solid #000000; border-width:4px;"><span style="background-color: #e5e5e5;">Main Tab</span></p>
<p><font style="font-weight: bold;">Book Id:</font> <font style="font-weight: bold;"><br /></font>This field is required, and should uniquely identify this Book record.

<p><font style="font-weight: bold;">Book Name:</font><font style="font-weight: bold;"><br /></font>This 60-character field allows additional description of the Book’s purpose/contents for lookup and documentation purposes. For example, if your Book Id begins with a Client or Site Id, you might was to start the Name with Invoices or Job Invoice.</p>
<p><font style="font-weight: bold;">Book Description:<br /></font>This field allows for a more detailed description of this Book to be entered by the user.</p>

<p><font style="font-weight: bold;">Start Date: End Date:<br /></font>The system uses the effective date of posted invoices to control which documents are selected. Unless limited by the range fields below, all documents associated with the invoice, plus those associated with the invoice’s work order are eligible for inclusion.</p>
<p>Note that the Date fields are NOT stored in the Book record or range Models.</p>
<p><font style="font-weight: bold;">Category:</font> <font style="font-weight: bold;">Description:</font> <font style="font-weight: bold;">Site Id:</font> <font style="font-weight: bold;">Job Id:</font> <font style="font-weight: bold;">Invoice Number:</font><br />
These range fields allow for additional filtering.</p>
<p style="margin-left: 36.00pt;"><font style="font-weight: bold;">Example</font><font style="font-weight: bold;">: Invoices Only</font><br />
If this Book is being used to assemble only SAMPro invoices, the Category should always be set to Invoice to avoid including worksheets or other documents in the run to the work order in the run.</p>
<p style="margin-left: 36.00pt;"><font style="font-weight: bold;">Example: TechAnywhere Attachments and Invoices<br /></font>If TechAnywhere is implemented for your company, you may wish to set the Category range to pick up invoices as well as those TechAnywhere document categories your customer requires for payment. The following list specifies the standard document categories used by TechAnywhere:</p>
<p style="margin-left: 72.00pt;"><font style="font-weight: bold;">Document Category (</font><font style="font-weight: bold;">Description</font><font style="font-weight: bold;">)</font></p>
<p style="margin-left: 72.00pt;">Receipt &#160;&#160;(Completed TA non-COD workorders)</p>
<p style="margin-left: 72.00pt;">Invoice &#160;&#160;(Completed TA COD workorders)</p>
<p style="margin-left: 72.00pt;">Signature &#160;(Signature captured at time of completing workorder)</p>
<p style="margin-left: 72.00pt;">TA Attachments &#160;(Document/File attached from TA Android)</p>

<p style="margin-left: 72.00pt;">CC Authorization&#160;&#160;(Credit card authorization forms from TA Android)</p>
<p style="margin-left: 36.00pt;">In this example setting the Category range to: Invoice,Receipt,Picture</p>
<p style="margin-left: 36.00pt;">would include SAMPro invoices, TechAnywhere receipts, and photos from the TechAnywhere Android app.</p>
<p style="margin-left: 36.00pt;"><font style="font-weight: bold;">Tip:</font> Be sure to save your ranges as a Model: your next batch of documents will be quicker to assemble because you can simply Select a Model with the click of a button. Models will also ensure consistency in the document selection process between runs.</p>
<p style="margin-left: 36.00pt;"><font style="font-weight: bold;">Tip:</font> These fields are NOT stored in the Book record. They should be completed (by keying them in, or selecting a Model) AFTER the Book record is saved/added but BEFORE clicking Autopopulate.</p>

<p>This field displays the list of documents that will be used to assemble the PDF book. You may view the document itself by clicking the Magnify button.</p>
<p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">&#160;</p>
<h2>1.12 User Record</h2>
<h3>1.12.1 Licensing</h3>
<p>A new Access Type, Special, has been added to the User record. It is designed for support and agent log on’s so that the count of user’s purchased licenses can be maintained more accurately. A master log in is required to create or edit this type of user.</p>
<h3>1.12.2 Notes Administrators and Global Ranges</h3>
<p>Previously, named global ranges (prefixed by a *) for viewers and reports could only be deleted by the user that created them. If that user left the firm, the range could not be deleted. In this release, users flagged as a Notes Administrator may delete global ranges defined by other users. Note that ranges are deleted by double-clicking and answering Yes to Remove Selected Range prompt.</p>
<h2>1.13 Quick Pick List</h2>
<p>This list appears when the user is asked to select a value (e.g, using the Dispatch Board’s Set Status button). The width of the box is now accommodates wider, uppercase text instead of truncating it.</p>
<h2>1.14 Sybase Resource Governor</h2>
<p>Corrects a problem encountered in previous releases when Sybase users exceeded the Sybase resource governor default limit of 50.&#160;&#160;In this release, MAX_CURSOR and MAX_STATEMENT are both set to 0 (unlimited) for each connection.</p>
<h2>1.15 Colors Button</h2>
<p>All obsolete entries have been removed from the list that appears then the Colors button (accessed by scrolling down the top button bar) is selected. The remaining entries (Background, Focus, Focus Text, Input, Input Text, Text, Title, ListEven, ListOdd and Required) may be used to control the color of these screen elements.</p>
<h3>1.15a Copy Colors</h3>
<p>Members of user group 'All' may now copy a selected user's colors to all users - previously, only support could do this. Regular users not belonging to user group All are still prevented from copying colors to all users.</p>

<h2>1.18 Custom Fields</h2>
<p>In this release, the Custom Fields functionality has been enhanced to allow the initial default value of a Check Box to be set to Checked in SAMPro Viewers.</p>
<p>To so do:</p>
<p>1. Custom Fields must be enabled in the user's User Groups and Functions (typcially, only an Admin would have this privilege).</p>
<p>2. Go to the applicable viewer, select and then right-click on the Check Box field you wish to default to checked. Click 'Yes' when the system asks if you wish to customize this field.</p>
<p>3. When the Custom Fields record opens, enter a Y in the Default Value header field, and save the Custom Fields record (NOTE: for Boolean-type fields, only the first character of the Default Value field is evaluated. If the first character is 't', 'T', 'y' or 'Y', then the field defaults to True.)</p>
<p>4. Close and reopen your original viewer, and click the New button. The check box you customized should now default to checked when you start a new record.</p>

<h2>2.2 Recurring AP Journal (sys-viewer-vrcrrngapjrnl)</h2>
<p>By default, the Recurring AP Journal prohibits the entry of AR Control, AP Control &amp; Bank accounts on GEN lines. Some users have found that these validations conflict with their internal processing procedures: the following registry entry may be implemented turn the default error behavior into a warning. This option should only be set if a corresponding one exists in sys-viewer-vapjrnl.</p>
<p><font style="font-weight: bold;">Id:</font> sys-viewer-vrcrrngapjrnl<br />
<font style="font-weight: bold;">Setting Key:</font> IgnoreCase3193 <font style="font-weight: bold;">Setting Value:</font> true</p>
<h2>2.3 Global Settings (sys-ffv-global-settings)</h2>
<p><font style="font-weight: bold;">Id: sys-ffv-global-settings</font></p>
<p>Note: global settings may be overridden for a specific user by entering the override on the User record’s Registry tab.</p>
<h3>2.3.1 Option to Define Statuses to Release to Tech</h3>
<p><font style="font-weight: bold;">Setting Key:</font> TechReleaseFromStatuses <font style="font-weight: bold;">Setting Value:</font> <font style="font-style: italic;">list of from statuses</font> (default is Pending)<br />
<br />
By default, clicking the Release to Tech button changes the status of the selected Technician line from ‘Pending’ to the application status for the Technician (most likely Unacknowledged). This enhancement allows the customization of the release to tech button located on the dispatch board and the workorder technician line to specify the "from" status (statuses) so that they no longer are forced to used just the status of "Pending". The "to" status will continue to follow the same rules as it always has.</p>
<p>Example: Setting Key: TechReleaseFromStatuses Setting Value: pending, waitcustapprvl</p>
<h3>2.3.2 Update Work Order Escalation Status in absence of Escalation Profile</h3>
<p>In the past, the WO Escalation status was only updated if an Escalation Profile existed in the system. For a variety of reasons (including invoicing and credit hold processing), the WO Escalation status/Status Category should be updated for all systems. The following registry option results in the work order escalation status always being updated, regardless of whether or not an Escalation Profile exists.</p>
<p><font style="font-weight: bold;">Setting Key:</font> EscalationManager <font style="font-weight: bold;">Setting Value:</font> <font style="font-weight: bold;">always</font></p>
<h3>2.3.3 Alternate Prevailing Wages Calculations</h3>
<p><font style="font-weight: bold;">Id:</font> sys-ffv-global-settings</p>
<p><font style="font-weight: bold;">Setting Key:</font> AlternatePrevailingWageMethod</p>
<p><font style="font-weight: bold;">Setting Value:</font> true</p>
<p>The State of New York uses a different method to calculate the prevailing rate: if either the employee’s base wage and/or the employees fringe package is less than the Prevailing Wage base wage and/or fringe package the difference must be added as additional wages paid to the employee. NOTE: if this registry option is enabled, it will be used for ALL Labor Rate based prevailing wage calculations, regardless of the location of the Job.</p>
<p style="margin-left: 36.00pt;"><font style="text-decoration: underline;">Example:</font></p>
<p style="margin-left: 36.00pt;">The following compares the new methodology (with the above registry enabled) with the standard methodology.</p>
<p style="margin-left: 36.00pt;">Employee Pay Rate = $49.00<br />
Employee Fringe Rate = $15.00<br />
Employee Total Package Rate = $64.00<br />
<br />
Prevailing Pay Rate = $48.00<br />
Prevailing Fringe Rate = $30.00<br />
Prevailing Total Package Rate = $78.00<br />
<br />
SAMPRO Standard Calculation ...<br />
Excess of Prevailing Package vs Employee Package = $14.00 (78.00 – 64.00)<br />
<font style="font-weight: bold;">Revised Effective Pay Rate = $63.00 (49.00 + 14.00)<br /></font><br />
Revised Calculations ...<br />
Larger of the pay rates = $49.00<br />
Larger of the fringe rates = $30.00<br />
Revised Total Package Rate = $79.00 (49.00 + 30.00)<br />
Excess of Revised Package vs Employee Package = $15.00 (79.00 – 64.00)<br />
<font style="font-weight: bold;">Revised Effective Pay Rate = $64.00 (49.00 + 15.00)</font></p>
<h3>2.3.3a Work Order Release-to-Tech Status</h3>
<p>This option provides an override for the status the Work Order Technician line is set <font style="text-decoration: underline;">to</font> when the Release to Tech button is clicked.</p>
<p>Id: sys-ffv-global-settings</p>
<p>Setting Key: TechReleaseToStatus Setting Value: Unacknowledged (or another log type status)</p>
<p style="margin-left: 36.00pt;">Example:</p>
<p style="margin-left: 36.00pt;">Id: sys-ffv-global-settings</p>
<p style="margin-left: 36.00pt;">Setting Key: TechReleaseToStatus Setting Value: Unacknowledged (or another log type status)</p>
<p style="margin-left: 36.00pt;">Id: sys-web-access-technician</p>
<p style="margin-left: 36.00pt;">Setting Key: DefaultStatus Setting Value: Pending</p>
<p style="margin-left: 36.00pt;">Setting Key: NewWorkOrderStatus: Setting Value: Pending<br />
<br />
With this setup, if the tech ID is changed on the workorder it will not automatically switch to unacknowledged thereby releasing the workorder to the technician. It allows the status to stay at pending while changing the tech on the workorder rather than releasing it to TechAnywhere.</p>
<p>Background:</p>
<p class="Tip_Note_Heading" style="margin-top: 4.00pt;"><font style="font-weight: normal;">Prior to this</font> <font style="font-weight: normal;">release</font><font style="font-weight: normal;">, the sys-web-access-technician registry option DefaultStatus drove what status the ‘Release To Tech’ button would change to. This registry also provided the status used when you changed the Tech Id</font> <font style="font-weight: normal;">(</font><font style="font-weight: normal;">on the Work Order Tech tab</font> <font style="font-weight: normal;">or on</font> <font style="font-weight: normal;">the Dispatch Board</font><font style="font-weight: normal;">)</font><font style="font-weight: normal;">. Typically, the registry option</font> <font style="font-weight: normal;">to set new lines added to the work order to pending so the dispatcher could release the work order to the technician when appropriate.</font></p>
<p class="Tip_Note_Heading" style="margin-top: 4.00pt; text-indent: 30.25pt;"><font style="font-weight: normal;">Setting Key: NewWorkOrderStatus Setting Value: Pending&#160;</font></p>
<p>The problem with this is that the DefaultStatus registry setting was dual purpose, so if you always needed the ‘Release To Tech’ button to change the status to Unacknowledged (needed for TechAnywhere), the registry option for sys-web-access-technician had to be:</p>
<p style="margin-left: 36.00pt;">Setting Key: DefaultStatus Setting Value: Unacknowledged.</p>
<p>Here is the problem with the old way:</p>
<p style="margin-left: 36.00pt;">Say I have 2 TechAnywhere technicians (TechA/TechB). I create a new workorder for TechA and his WO tech line is added at the status of “Pending”.</p>
<p style="margin-left: 36.00pt;">Now let's say we needed to change the tech on the WO from TechA -&gt; TechB. If you took the method of marking TechA to completed/cancelled, and then <font style="text-decoration: underline;">added</font> TechB as a second tech to the WO, TechB’s status would come in at “Pending” which is good.</p>
<p style="margin-left: 36.00pt;">If you used another method, like going to the TechA tech line and change the tech ID to TechB (or using Classic board to re-assign the WO), this is treated differently and then uses the DefaultStatus registry setting, which sets it to “Unacknowledged”. At this point, it has now automatically released the workorder to the technician in TechAnywhere without the dispatcher realizing.</p>
<p>The new TechReleaseToStatus registry setting allows us to set the default status to pending, so that if the WO is reassigned, it is not automatically releasing the workorder, and have an override on the release to tech button so that it always changes the workorder to the certain status it is set to regardless of the DefaultStatus registry setting.</p>
<h3>2.3.4 Work Order Escalation / Date Work Completed</h3>
<p>Initially, the WO Date Work Completed was set from the most recent Tech Tab date when the WO Escalation status went to completed. This made sense in the days before Techanywhere.&#160;&#160;With TechAnywhere, scheduled dates do not always get rolled over, so the Date Work Completed may be days earlier (when the tech first got his wo) than when he actually sent the completed status change. Due to timing issues with sending labor lines from TA, the latest labor date cannot be used for the date completed.</p>
<p>In this release, this registry entry will only set the Work Order Date Work Completed to today if it is initially blank (set to 01011900) AND if the WO Escalation Status goes to Completed.</p>
<p><font style="font-weight: bold;">Setting Key:</font> DateWorkCompletedToday</p>
<p><font style="font-weight: bold;">Setting Value:</font> true (default false preserves current behavior)</p>
<h3>2.3.5 Document Management</h3>
<p>Although SAMPro supports saving/archiving Invoices as PDFs there is a downside.&#160;&#160;Specifically, viewing saved PDF documents is not done 'within' SAMPro; this means that SAMPro’s Email Report option is not available from the PDF document reader.</p>
<p>The registry setting described below allows for the DBR and the PDF versions of saved report to co-exist.&#160;&#160;Viewing the saved document from within SAMPro uses the DBR version.&#160;&#160;Viewing from the DBAnalytics framework uses the PDF version.&#160;&#160;This feature eliminates the need to have DBRs converted to PDFs before emailing to DBAnalyics and FMAnywhere users.&#160;&#160;Instead, the PDF can be viewed instantly from within the browser.</p>
<p>To use this new feature you must add the following registry entry:<br />
Id: sys-ffv-global-settings</p>
<p>Setting Key: UseConvertedDBRs &#160;Setting Value: true<br />
<br />
When implemented, the system converts DBR documents to archived pdf documents and saves original archive DBR file in the ConvertedDBRs subfolder, within the appropriate Month/Year directory.</p>
<h3>2.3.6 Converting Large Reports to PDF</h3>
<p>This release addresses the problem of running very large reports and then saving them to PDF after they had previewed on the screen. In previous versions, this could fail when Smalltalk ran out of memory.&#160;&#160;In this release, the XML generation has been changed from running in memory to running in WriteStream. A temporary file will be generated by Writestream; it will be</p>
<p style="margin-left: 36.00pt;">Saved in the basedir/username directory.</p>
<p style="margin-left: 36.00pt;">The temp filename includes the time (tempXML_HHMMSS) in the name.</p>
<p style="margin-left: 36.00pt;">The temp file is removed at the end of the process.</p>
<p>In addition, a registry entry has been added to support increased memory for the Java run time: this setting is only necessary for someone attempting to convert a very large report into a PDF.&#160;&#160;When the new setting is present, XMLtoPDF is instructed to allocate more memory for the Java run time so that it can process the larger XML files without running out of memory.</p>
<p style="margin-left: 36.00pt;">Registry Id: sys-ffv-global-settings<br />
Setting Key: vmflagsxmltopdf &#160;Setting Value: -Xms800m -Xmx800m</p>
<h3>2.3.7 Reporting - Override Global Preview Reports as PDF Option</h3>
<p>Setting the sys-ffv-global-settings option PreviewReportsAsPDF to true results in all reports (except posting reports such as service invoice) being displayed as PDF's when they are run. This release provides the ability to disable this functionality on an individual report basis by implementing the following registry:</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: bold;">Id:</span> sys-report-<span style="font-style: italic;"><i>reportfunctionid</i></span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: bold;">Setting Key:</span> PreviewReportsAsPDF &#160;&#160;<span style="font-weight: bold;">Setting Value:</span> false</p>
<h2>2.4 Quote Master</h2>
<p><font style="font-weight: bold;">Id: sys-viewer-vqte</font></p>
<h3>2.4.1 Allow Changes to Accepted Options</h3>
<p>In an earlier release, validation was added to disallow changes to any scope lines if the status is set Printed, Accepted, Approved or Declined, forcing the user to first change the status to Open to make changes. Changes to Labor, Inventory, Material, Other and Subcontractor lines were only allowed if the associated Scope Option was set to Open.<br />
<br />
The validation associated with Accepted options has resulted in procedural issues for some of our customers. For this reason, the following registry setting may be implemented to allow changes to Accepted options on the Scope tab, and also to Labor, Inventory, Material, Other and Subcontractor lines associated with Accepted Scope Options.</p>
<p><font style="font-weight: bold;">Note:</font> this registry option should be used with caution if CRMAnywhere is enabled; options that a customer has accepted should not be altered.</p>
<p><font style="font-weight: bold;">Setting Key:</font> IgnoreAcceptedValidation <font style="font-weight: bold;">Setting Value:</font> true (default is false)</p>
<h2>2.5 Purchase Order (sys-viewer-vprchseordrlst)</h2>
<p><font style="font-weight: bold;">Id:</font> sys-viewer-vprchseordrlst</p>
<h3>2.5.1 Allow PO Type Change on Existing Record</h3>
<p>In previous releases, users had the ability to go into purchase orders and change them from purchase orders to credit purchase orders and vice versa without any checks or tests. This had more impact on clients using the Unvouchered Option in the Accounting period as it produce an out-of-balance gl transaction. In this release, validation has been added to lock this down. If the PO is in add mode, the user is allowed to switch between the Purchase and Credit types. Once the record has been added, however, the user must cancel the PO, and add it as the correct type.</p>
<p>A registry entry (not recommended) is available to ignore this validation and restore the previous behavior and allow the PO Type to be changed on existing Purchase Orders:</p>
<p><font style="font-weight: bold;">Setting Key:</font> OkToChangePOType <font style="font-weight: bold;">Setting Value:</font> true</p>
<h3>2.5.2. Set Cost from Standard</h3>
<p>When a PO is created, an Inventory Item's cost defaults from the Inventory Item's Vendor tab. The following registry setting overrides this behavior and instead uses the Item’s Standard Cost. If the Standard Cost is not completed, the Last Cost is used.</p>
<p>Setting Key: useStandardCostFirst Setting Value: true (default is false)</p>
<p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">&#160;</p>
<h2>2.6 AR Sales Journal (sys-viewer-varslslst)</h2>
<p><font style="font-weight: bold;">Id:</font> sys-viewer-varslslst</p>
<h3>2.6.1 Disable Account Type Validations on Price lines</h3>
<p>Validations were added to the AR Sales Journal to prohibit the entry of AP Control accounts on Prices lines. Some users find that these validations conflict with their processing procedures: the following registry entry may be implemented turn the default error behavior into a warning.</p>
<p><font style="font-weight: bold;">WARNING:</font> disabling these validations is NOT recommended.</p>
<p><font style="font-weight: bold;">Setting Key:</font> IgnoreCase3193&#160;&#160;<font style="font-weight: bold;">Setting Value:</font> true</p>
<h3>2.6.2 Allow Entry Type to be Changed</h3>
<p>Validation has been added to prevent the user from changing the Entry Type on an existing entry. By default, the Entry Type may only be changed in the Sale Journal is in ‘add’ mode.</p>
<p>The following registry entry overrides the above validation, effectively restoring the previous behavior. Implementing this option is <font style="text-decoration: underline;">not</font> recommended.</p>
<p><font style="font-weight: bold;">Setting Key:</font> OkToChangeEntryType <font style="font-weight: bold;">Setting Value:</font> true (default is false)</p>
<h2>2.7 Start Import Stock Status (sys-start-simprtlvls)</h2>
<p>This function is called when the Import Stock Levels is clicked in the Location viewer. By default the Picking Sequence, Reorder Level and Order Up To fields for all selected items are imported, regardless of whether or not the item is flagged as Stocked. This enhancement provides a registry entry that will filter out all items not flagged as 'Stocked'.</p>
<p style="margin-left: 36.00pt;"><font style="font-weight: bold;">Id:</font> sys-start-simprtlvls<br />
<font style="font-weight: bold;">Setting Key:</font> Set LimitToStockItems <font style="font-weight: bold;">Setting Value:</font> true (default false)</p>
<h2>2.8 View Dispatch Board (sys-viewer-vdsptchbrd)</h2>
<h3>2.8.1 Identify Unavailable Techs</h3>
<p>The Dispatch board and other viewers in the system are now able to indicate that a Technician is unavailable. The following registry entry is required to turn this functionality on. The Unavailable Days are set in the Unavailable Tab in the Technician record:</p>
<p style="margin-left: 36.00pt;">On the Classic board, unavailability is indicated with a red background on the column or row header displaying the Technician’s information for those days that he or she is unavailable. On the Power board, a currently unavailable Technician’s line in the Technician Summary (upper portion of the board) will be displayed in red.</p>
<p style="margin-left: 36.00pt;">In New Call, if the Technician and Date scheduled are both entered, a Warning will appear saying the Tech is Unavailable when the New Call is saved.<br />
<br />
In TechFinder, the word ‘OFF’ will appear on the Technician hours pane if the technician is Unavailable. A Warning will appear saying the Tech is Unavailable if you select an Unavailable date.<br />
<br />
In the Work Order Technician Tab, when the Tech Id or Date Scheduled is added or changed, the user will be warned if the Technician is Unavailable.</p>
<p>To implement this functionality, the following registry option must be enabled:</p>
<p><font style="font-weight: bold;">Setting Key:</font> IdentifyUnavailableTechs <font style="font-weight: bold;">Setting Value:</font> true</p>
<h3>2.8.2 Display Description from Work Order Work Requested</h3>
<p>In previous releases, the Description field on the Dispatch Board’s Work Order List defaulted from the Work Order Name. In this enhancement, if the Work Order Name is blank, the first 40 characters of the Work Order Work Requested will be displayed in the Description.</p>
<p>In addition, the following registry option may be implemented to display the first 40 characters of the Work Order Work Requested in the Description first. If the Work Order Work Requested is blank, the Work Order name will be displayed instead.</p>
<p><font style="font-weight: bold;">Setting Key:</font> DescriptionFromWorkRequested <font style="font-weight: bold;">Setting Value:</font> Value: true (default false)</p>
<h3>2.8.3 Display Site Alpha from Site Name</h3>
<p>When implemented, the following registry setting substitutes the Client Site Name for the Client Site Alpha wherever it is referenced on the Dispatch Board. Note that only the first 20 characters of the Client Site Name for the Client Site Alpha on the upper portion of the Power Board. The column heading/title of this field will not be changed.</p>
<p><font style="font-weight: bold;">Setting Key:</font> ShowFullSiteName <font style="font-weight: bold;">Setting Value:</font> true (default false)</p>
<p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">&#160;</p>
<h2>2.9 SubAnywhere (sys-subanywhere)</h2>
<p>An existing sys-subanywhere registry setting disables collateral from SubAnywhere from attaching to the site. In this release, you may also disable collateral from attaching to the equipment by implementing the following option:</p>
<p><font style="font-weight: bold;">Id:</font> sys-subanywhere</p>
<p><font style="font-weight: bold;">Setting Key:</font> AttachCollateralToEquipment <font style="font-weight: bold;">Setting Value:</font> false (default is true)</p>
<h2>2.10 Check (sys-viewer-vchklst)</h2>
<p>The standard view of the Check viewer was changed to simplify initial data entry, making it desirable to disable all fields in this viewer via registry so that group ‘All’ users would not accidentally make changes to this record. Access/rights to this record should already be controlled via User Groups and Functions for members of other User Groups.</p>
<p>To disable all Check fields:</p>
<p><font style="font-weight: bold;">Id: sys-viewer-vchcklst</font></p>
<p><font style="font-weight: bold;">Setting Key:</font> DisabledFieldsParent</p>
<p><font style="font-weight: bold;">Setting Value:</font></p>
<p>gl-bnk: glaccnt.id,glentty.id,chck.nmbr,chck.amnt,chck.rfrnce-nme,chck.dte-chck,chck.type,chck.dscrptn</p>
<p><font style="font-weight: bold;">Setting Key:</font> disabledFieldschild</p>
<p><font style="font-weight: bold;">Setting Value:</font> chcklst.amnt-grss</p>
<p>Also see user note 1.8 for suggested settings in the User Groups and Functions viewer.</p>
<h3>Registries Required for Initial Data Entry</h3>
<p>This functionality depends on the following registry entry to automatically assign a record Id value</p>
<p><font style="font-weight: bold;">Setting Key:</font> IdFromRn <font style="font-weight: bold;">Setting Value:</font> true</p>
<p>To avoid confusion during the manual entry process also implement the following registry option<br /></p>
<p><font style="font-weight: bold;">Setting Key:</font> NewRecordAfterAdd <font style="font-weight: bold;">Setting Value:</font> true</p>
<p>Without this setting the only way the user can initiate a new check record is to hit the New Record button.</p>
<p style="margin-left: 36.00pt;"><font style="font-weight: bold;">IMPORTANT:</font> After initial data entry has been completed, the options required for Initial Data Entries should be disabled.</p>

<h2>2.11 Registry Canadian Payroll Direct Deposit (sys-aft-glaccountid)</h2>
<h3>Purpose:</h3>
<p class="Reference_Line" style="margin-bottom: 0.00pt;">An AFT registry entry must be created for each GL Account and GL Entity combination for which you will be generating direct deposit paychecks. Your bank will provide details on the necessary account and routing numbers, as well as sending the electronic file. Note that the registry entry provides critical file information for the funds transfer, and should always be pre-noted to verify its correctness.</p>

<h2>2.12 Work Order (sys-viewer-vwrkordr)</h2>
<p><font style="font-weight: bold;">Id: sys-viewer-vwrkordr</font></p>
<h3>2.12.1 WO Inventory / IM History Alert:</h3>
<p>This entry validates that the total cost and quantity entered directly on the tab matches the total cost and quantity what have already been or will be posted to Inventory history when the Work Order is saved. If a discrepancy is found, a TabHistoryMismatch alert box will appear, and the work order will not be saved. The tab mismatch information is written to the error log. This alert should only appear if erroneous reversal history was previously written to Inventory History – a sporadic issue in previous images. It is only recommended for users who are concerned with tightening up inventory, and are willing to have support correct issues before work orders can be edited/invoiced. To implement this option:</p>
<p><font style="font-weight: bold;">Setting Key:</font> TabMismatchINV-IMH <font style="font-weight: bold;">Setting Value:</font> enabled</p>
<p>If this option is not implemented this alert will not be raised.</p>
<h3>2.12.2 Limit Statuses Entered on Technician and Log Tabs</h3>
<p>The following registry options permit the log type statuses entered on the work order to be limited to those specified, or to exclude those specified.</p>
<p style="margin-left: 36.00pt;"><font style="font-weight: bold;">Tip:</font> in most cases, this functionality would be implemented by user or user group (sys-viewer-vwrkordr<font style="font-style: italic;">-branchid-userid,</font> sys-viewer- vwrkordr<font style="font-style: italic;">--userid</font> (if Branches are not implemented) or sys-viewer- vwrkordr-<font style="font-style: italic;">usergroupid)</font> so that the restrictions are only implemented as appropriate.</p>

<p style="margin-left: 36.00pt;"><font style="font-weight: bold;">Example:</font></p>
<p style="margin-left: 36.00pt;">This example would be implement to prevent users in the dispatcher group from directly entering the statuses of billed, archived or no bill on the Technician or Log tabs. Note that if the work order is billed via service invoice, this registry does not prevent the system from changing the status from completed to billed.</p>

<h3>2.12.13 Show RININV4 Invoices on WO Invoices Tab</h3>
<p>In Version 8.0.510.023 and up, the Invoice Description, Balance and Last Payment Date were added to the Work Order Invoices tab. Unfortunately, this resulted in RININV4 type invoices not displaying on the tab. In this release, the Invoices tab will now first tries to show SERVICEINVOICE type invoices WITH the new columns. &#160;If there are there are NO SERVICEINVOICE type invoices found and the following new registry setting is in effect, the system will then show RININV4 type invoices WITHOUT the new columns.</p>

<h2>2.13 TechAnywhere Registry Options</h2>
<p><font style="font-weight: bold;">Id:</font> sys-techanywhere</p>
<h3>2.13.1 Adjust Default Date or Accounting Period</h3>
<p>Inventory from TechAnywhere can be posted to the default accounting period, even if the effective date is outside of the period range. However, a problem occurs when the user attempts to bill the WO and encounters an error indicating that the effective date was out of period range. A registry entry is now available to adjust either the date or accounting period to keep them in sync.&#160;</p>
<p>When the defaulted Date and Accounting Period are NOT out-of-sync, NO adjustments are made to the defaulted values.&#160;&#160;The rules noted below are used only when an adjustment is necessary.</p>
<p><font style="font-weight: bold;">Setting Key:</font> AdjustDefaultDateOrPeriod <font style="font-weight: bold;">Setting Value:</font> period or date</p>
<p>If period is selected, the Accounting Period table is queried for eligible Accounting Periods.&#160;&#160;To qualify, the period must be Active and its date range must include the defaulted Effective Date.&#160;&#160;When multiple periods are eligible, the one with the smallest Period Id is chosen to become the new Accounting Period for the current transaction.&#160;&#160;If no eligible period is found, nothing is changed.</p>
<p>If date is selected, the Effective Date is adjusted to be either the Start Date or the End Date of the defaulted Accounting Period.&#160;&#160;The Start Date is chosen when the current date is less than the Start Date.&#160;&#160;The End Date is chosen when the current date is greater than the End Date.</p>
<p>NOTE: the current TechAnywhere post behavior does not change unless the new registry setting is turned on.&#160;</p>
<h3>2.13.2 Disregard Old Status when updating new status.</h3>
<p>Currently there are 2 ways that TechAnywhere status changes are posted into Sampro.</p>
<p style="margin-left: 36.00pt;">1) If the wrkordrtchncn_rn matches what is in the message, the status change message will update the workorder technician status to the new status (no matter what the old status).<br />
<br />
2) If the wrkordrtchncn_rn no longer exists, we use a "backup" method. Check for the Workorder, Technician, Date Scheduled, and old Workorder Technician Status.</p>
<p>In order for the secondary method to be consistent with the primary status change method it should not care about the old status, and just override with what the technician is changing the status to regardless of any manual changes made in Sampro. This will reduce the occurrence of the Status Change Error Alerts. This functionality has been implemented as recommended registry settable option so as to not change the default behavior of TechAnywhere status posting.</p>
<p><font style="font-weight: bold;">Setting Key:</font> DisregardOldStatus &#160;<font style="font-weight: bold;">Setting Value:</font> true (default is false)</p>

<p>TechAnywhere 2.7 Android will now create Revenue Adjustment lines based on the discounts the tech took in the field. The following registry option must be implemented to provide the correct cost category for the Revenue Adjustment:</p>
<p><font style="font-weight: bold;">Setting Key:</font> DiscountCostCategory <font style="font-weight: bold;">Setting Value:</font> <font style="font-style: italic;">CostCategoryId of discount</font></p>
<p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">&#160;</p>
<h2>2.14 Start AP Payment Approved List (sys-start-sappymntapprvdlst)</h2>
<p>This registry entry may be used to control the order this list appears in, and to set the Next Pay Date into the future for additional purchase control. .</p>
<p><font style="font-weight: bold;">Id:</font> sys-start-sappymntapprvdlst</p>
<p><font style="font-weight: bold;">Setting K</font><font style="font-weight: bold;">ey:</font> OrderBy &#160;&#160;&#160;<font style="font-weight: bold;">Setting Value:</font> jb_id,wrkordr_id</p>
<p>This option enables the user to specify that the Start AP Payment Approved List is ordered by Job Id (in the PO Header), and then by Work Order Id (in the PO Header) within each Job.</p>
<p><font style="font-weight: bold;">Setting Key:</font> CashManagerPayDate &#160;<font style="font-weight: bold;">Setting Value:</font> 2099-12-31</p>
<p>This may be used to override the Pay Date entered on the Start AP Approved List (which may have been originally set on the Start AP Approved List PM). It would be used to make this process act like a 3<font style="vertical-align: super;">rd</font> approval function so that invoices approved in this fashion are NOT paid as part of the normal AP Check printing process (because the date is set so far in the future). To pay these checks, a cash manager would run AP Date to Pay, filtering on the date referenced in this entry in the Next Pay Date range. The cash manager could then review the entries, and select an appropriate Pay Date.</p>
<h2>2.15 Stock Status Report (sys-report-rstckstts)</h2>
<p><font style="font-weight: bold;">Id:</font> sys-report-rstckstts</p>
<h3>Use Temp Table for Performance Enhancement</h3>
<p>A new enhancement is available that uses a temp table to improve the performance of the Stock Status Report. This enhancement was designed for SQL users but may also benefit Sybase users. The following registry is required to enable this feature.</p>
<p><font style="font-weight: bold;">Setting Key:</font> UseTempTable <font style="font-weight: bold;">Setting Value:</font> true</p>
<h3>Show Negative Costs</h3>
<p><font style="font-weight: bold;">Setting Key:</font> ShowNegativeCosts <font style="font-weight: bold;">Setting Value:</font> true (default false to preserve current behavior)</p>
<p>In previous releases, if you had a negative quantity on one or more lines of this report, the report forced the line cost to zero; however, the report totals include negatives. This meant that the totals would not match the sum of the lines if negative quantities were involved. When this option is implemented, negative line costs will appear on the report, so that the printed detail will match the totals.</p>

<h2>2.18 Inventory Receipts Journal (sys-viewer-vinvntryrcpt)</h2>
<h3>2.18.1 Load Entries by Purchase Order List</h3>
<p>By default, the Inventory Receipts Journal loads the child lines by Inventory Id for Inventory lines and by Description for General purchases.&#160;&#160;If a single PO contains both Inventory and General lines, the IRJ lines will start with the Inventory lines ordered by Id, followed by the General lines ordered by Description.&#160;&#160;The following registry settings change the Inventory Receipts Journal list to match the order in which the Inventory (INV) and General (GEN) lines appear on the Purchase Order Viewer lines.</p>
<p><font style="font-weight: bold;">Setting Key:</font> LineOrderINV <font style="font-weight: bold;">Setting Value:</font> POLineOrder</p>
<p><font style="font-weight: bold;">Setting Key:</font> LineOrderGEN <font style="font-weight: bold;">Setting Value:</font> POLineOrder</p>
<p>Notice that both of the above options must be entered to control the Inventory and General lines.</p>

<p><font style="font-weight: bold;">Setting Key:</font> QuickAttachAutoSaveFileName <font style="font-weight: bold;">Setting Value:</font> ^mtime^ OR ^time^</p>
<p>Both the ^time^ and ^mtime^ tokens are now supported in Quick Attach when used to generate the filename. The military time string is generated in both cases.</p>
<h3>2.22.3 Prompt User for Description</h3>
<p>This new registry option may be implemented to allow the user to enter a description during the Quick Attach process. The registry entry for the function must have the following entry, where the value is set to prompt instead of a literal or tokenized value:</p>
<p><font style="font-weight: bold;">Setting Key:</font> QuickAttachDescription <font style="font-weight: bold;">Setting Value:</font> prompt</p>
<p>This will then allow a user to enter a document description in the quick attach wizard.</p>

<h2>2.28 New Call viewer (sys-newcall)</h2>
<h3>2.28.1 Set Priority from Equipment</h3>
<p>In previous releases, the Priority in New Call only defaulted from the work code; the priority in the equipment record was not considered. This release Implements a new registry setting for the purpose of deciding how to default the Priority of a new work order: always from the equipment, never from the equipment, or from the equipment when the priority is higher.</p>
<p><font style="font-weight: bold;">Registry Id:</font> sys-newcall</p>
<p><font style="font-weight: bold;">Setting Key:</font> PriorityFromEquipment <font style="font-weight: bold;">Setting Value:</font> Always or Never or WhenHigher</p>
<p>Currently, the Priority defaults from the Priority value from the selected Work Code, but may be overridden by the user.&#160;&#160;Selecting 'Never' (or not making a setting at all) preserves the existing behavior.</p>
<p>Selecting 'Always' means always default the Priority value from the Equipment record; selecting a work code with a different priority will not override equipment’s priority in New Call, but the user can manually change the priority. If the user should never be allow to override the priority in new call, the field may be disabled via the following registry:</p>
<p style="margin-left: 36.00pt;"><font style="font-weight: bold;">Registry Id:</font> sys-start-snwcll</p>
<p style="margin-left: 36.00pt;"><font style="font-weight: bold;">Setting Key:</font> DisabledFieldsParent Setting Value: wrkcde.prrty</p>
<p>Selecting 'WhenHigher' means default the higher priority available from either the Work Code or the Equipment record.&#160;&#160;If a Work Code is NOT selected, use the value from the Equipment record.</p>
<h3>2.28.2 Default Start Time to Current System Time:</h3>
<p>Currently, New Call has registry option to set the Date Scheduled to today. This release adds an option to set the time to the current system time.</p>
<p><font style="font-weight: bold;">Setting Key:</font> defaultstarttime <font style="font-weight: bold;">Setting Value:</font> current</p>
<p>The 'current' time is reset when the New button is clicked and after a work order is created.</p>
<h3>2.28.3 Options to Write the Service Tasks and/or Service Parts List to New Call Work Orders</h3>
<p>This enhancement enables the Service Parts and/or Service Tasks Lists to be written to the Work Order Equipment Tab’s Work Requested, regardless of the Work Order Type selected. In previous releases, the Service Tasks List was ONLY written to New Call Work Orders of type Installation. This new registry also pertains to Work Orders from TechAnywhere and Web Logs.</p>
<p>Note: if both registries below are enabled, the service task list should be written first, a line of space, followed by the service parts list.</p>
<p><font style="font-weight: bold;">Setting Key:</font> ServiceParts&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;<font style="font-weight: bold;">Setting Value:</font> workrequested</p>
<p>If this registry option is enabled, the system will write ALL Service Parts from the Equipment record's Service Parts List to the Work Order Equipment Tab’s Work Requested, regardless of the Work Order Type being created. If this registry setting is enabled, the Service Parts Id will also be written to the Work Order Equipment line.</p>
<p><font style="font-weight: bold;">Setting Key:</font> ServiceTasks&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;<font style="font-weight: bold;">Setting Value:</font> workrequested<br />

<p>In previous releases, if you created a new Site Equipment record, and then used the Clone PM button to copy an existing inspection schedule, only those PM’s that did not have a work order assigned were copied. In this release, the default functionality is to clone ALL lines that are marked OK to Renew, regardless of whether or not a work order is assigned. In this way, when the PM Agreement is renewed via Start Renew Service Contracts or Start Create New PM Work Schedule from Old, the new equipment will have a full set of inspections.</p>
<p>The following registry may be enabled to restore the previous behavior.</p>
<p><font style="font-weight: bold;">Registry Id:</font> sys-viewer-vclntsteeqpmnt</p>
<p><font style="font-weight: bold;">Setting Key:</font> clonePMScheduleIfOkToRenew <font style="font-weight: bold;">Setting Value:</font> false (default will be true)</p>
<p style="margin-left: 36.00pt;"><font style="font-weight: bold;">Note:</font> When Cloning PM Schedules a PM schedule line assigned from a master contract will never be cloned.</p>
<h3>2.32 Report AP Check Pressure Seal Format Registry</h3>
<p>This release supports a special AP Check format to support printing on pressure seal check; these checks may be folded and sealed without an envelope needed. This functionality requires a new customization file (since the printable area is smaller to allow for the seal); a charge will be required for this – please contact your account manager for a quote. In addition, the following two registry options are needed to define the mailer portion of the page (prints the address the check is mailed to) and to limit the number of invoices that may be listed on the stub.</p>
<p><font style="font-weight: bold;">Registry Id:</font> sys-report-rapchck</p>
<p><font style="font-weight: bold;">Setting Key:</font> SectionOrder <font style="font-weight: bold;">Setting Value:</font> stub,check,mailer</p>
<p><font style="font-weight: bold;">Setting Key:</font> MaximumInvoicesForCheck <font style="font-weight: bold;">Setting Value:</font> 17</p>
<p>Note: this format should print correctly with the SectionPositions entry disabled; be sure to verify your settings with plain paper first.</p>
<h3>2.33 Generate Recurring Labor Entries – Registry to Allow Zero Hour Lines</h3>
<p>By default, labor lines entered on the Employee Recurring Wages Tab with zero hours are skipped by this function. Since some clients wish to use these lines to enter extra compensation (bonus amounts), the following registry has been enabled to allow zero hour lines to be processed.</p>
<p><font style="font-weight: bold;">Registry Id:</font> sys-start-Spstrcrrnglbr</p>
<p><font style="font-weight: bold;">Setting Key:</font> AllowZeroHourLines <font style="font-weight: bold;">Setting Value:</font> true (default false)</p>
<h2>2.34 Default Item’s Standard Cost on Purchase Orders</h2>
<p>When a PO is created, an Inventory Item's cost defaults from the Inventory Item's Vendor tab. The following registry setting overrides this behavior and instead uses the Item’s Standard Cost. If the Standard Cost is not completed, the Last Cost is used.</p>
<p><font style="font-weight: bold;">Registry Id:</font> sys-viewer-vprchseordrlst</p>
<p><font style="font-weight: bold;">Setting Key:</font> useStandardCostFirst <font style="font-weight: bold;">Setting Value:</font> true (default is false)</p>
<p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">&#160;</p>
<h2>2.35 'olddialog' Printing Option</h2>
<p>In previous releases, if the olddialog was enabled in sys-printer-dialog-ssrvcebllngcmpte, the posting report would launch when the user said 'No' to the print confirmation.&#160;In addition, invoices were prematurely e- mailed before the print confirmation.<br />
<br />
This release eliminates premature emailing for service invoicing when olddialog is enabled, and only lauches the posting report if a successful print was confirmed. &#160;It also eliminates the option to print multiple times.</p>
<p style="margin-left: 36.00pt;"><font style="font-weight: bold;">Note: 'olddialog' Limitations<br /></font>Multiple copies/collating should NOT be used with the 'olddialog' option. &#160;&#160;</p>
<h2>2.36 Start Compute Service Invoices</h2>
<p>The following registry entry may be enabled to provide a possible performance enhancement for the Start Service Compute Service Invoice function:</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: bold;">Registry Id:</span> sys-start-ssrvcebllngcmpte</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: bold;">Setting Key:</span> &#160;CostOrRevenueFilter &#160;&#160;&#160;<span style="font-weight: bold;">Setting Value:</span> true &#160;(default is false)</p>
<p>Note: this registry eliminates JOB EOM transactions from the calculation; this may or may not impact the performance of Start Service Billing Compute.</p>
<h2>2.37 Positive Pay (Dollar Bank)</h2>
<p>This release supports Positive Pay for Dollar Bank. If your checks are run against multiple GL Account/Entity combinations, a registry entry should be created for each one for which positive pay reporting is desired. The following registry settings are required:</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: bold;">Id:</span> sys-positive-pay</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: bold;">Setting Key:</span> Format&#160;&#160;<span style="font-weight: bold;">Setting Value:</span> DollarBank</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: bold;">Setting Key:</span> AccountNo&#160;&#160;<span style="font-weight: bold;">Setting Value:</span> as provided by the bank</p>
<p>The filename registry is optional, If you do not use this option, the system will prompt you to select a name and directory for this file. Typically, this option would be used if multiple branches run this report. Typically, the extension is set to txt. The file will be created in the working directory where the SAM Pro executable v.exe is running.</p>
<p><font style="font-weight: bold;">Setting Key:</font> filename <font style="font-weight: bold;">Setting Value:</font> <font style="font-style: italic;">yourfilename^date^^time^.txt</font></p>
<h2>2.38 Positive Pay (Anchor Bank)</h2>
<p>This release supports Positive Pay for Anchor Bank. If your checks are run against multiple GL Account/Entity combinations, a registry entry should be created for each one for which positive pay reporting is desired. The following registry settings are required:</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: bold;">Id:</span> sys-positive-pay &#160;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: bold;">Setting Key:</span> Format&#160;&#160;<span style="font-weight: bold;">Setting Value:</span> AnchorBank</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: bold;">Setting Key:</span> AccountNo&#160;&#160;<span style="font-weight: bold;">Setting Value:</span> as provided by the bank</p>
<p>The filename registry is optional, If you do not use this option, the system will prompt you to select a name and directory for this file. Typically, this option would be used if multiple branches run this report. Typically, the extension is set to txt. The file will be created in the working directory where the SAM Pro executable v.exe is running.</p>
<p><font style="font-weight: bold;">Setting Key:</font> filename <font style="font-weight: bold;">Setting Value:</font> <font style="font-style: italic;">yourfilename^date^^time^.ext</font></p>
<p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">&#160;</p>
<h1>3 AP and Purchasing</h1>
<p>This release corrects an SQL Error that occurred due to single-quote characters embedded in Vendor Invoice Check Description in the following functions: Start AP Payment Approved List, Start AP Payment Approved List PM and Start PWP Approved List.</p>
<p>This release includes performance enhancements to the View AP Date to Pay, Start AP Payment Approved List, and Start AP Payment Approved List PM functions.</p>
<h2>3.1 Start Create EOM Unvouchered AP GL Entries:</h2>
<p>This release preserves the 'InitialValueFor' registry settings for this function; previously, they were being overridden by the default values for this function. &#160;</p>
<p>In previous releases, this function skipped GEN lines from Credit PO’s but picked up Inventory lines. In this release, applicable Inventory and Gen lines on Credit PO’s lines will be processed.</p>
<h2>3.2 AP Journal</h2>
<p>The exact Equipment specified on the PO now defaults when it is used to create an AP Journal entry. Previously, the Equipment defaulted from the first Equipment line of the associated Work Order.</p>
<p>Previously, the sidebar Attachment, Notes, and Scanning buttons were not available unless you manually Refreshed after adding a record. The side button bar is properly refreshed after a journal entry is added.</p>
<p>The AP Discount is now rounded to the nearest penny when calculated (it was truncated).</p>
<p>Credit type PO’s created in recent versions can be successfully imported.</p>
<p>The Add Taxes button now supports Tax Groups with cumulative tax authorities.</p>
<p>In previous releases, the system erred when you added an entry with a single quote ' in the EFT/Credit Trx Id: field, but allowed the entry to be saved (but could not be deleted). In this release, the user is no longer allowed to enter the single quote in this field.</p>
<h3>3.2.1 Multi-receipt, multi-vouchered Purchase Orders</h3>
<p>This release addresses the situation where a PO is created for an Inventory Item with partial going to the WO (or Job) and the rest to stock, and it was then received and vouchered multiple times. Previously, when vouchering for the stock portion of the inventory, the WO/Job information was defaulted if you changed the quantity and you were not allow to change it. In this release, the unwanted defaulting of WO/Job info has been disabled so that the Purchase Order can be vouchered correctly.</p>
<h3>3.2.2 Subcontractor Tab</h3>
<p>Eliminates the spurious error message 'Purchase Order cannot be closed until all committed costs have been relieved' which appeared when you set the Closed PO button prior to saving an entry for a PO with SUB amounts 100% earned.</p>
<p>In the PO’s Sub tab, revenue fields are not calculated because Subcontractor costs are not receipted to JCH.&#160;&#160;However, these calculations should be available when the PO is vouchered in AP. In this release, the system will attempt to calculate the Amount Revenue field on the Subcontractor tab for both T&amp;M and Fixed-Allow Extras Billing Items. In the latter case, the Revenue will be only calculated if the Extra box is checked.</p>
<p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">&#160;</p>
<h2>3.3 Recurring AP Journal</h2>
<p>Validation prevents the entry of negative amounts in the following fields: Recurring Amount, Quantity, Quantity Billable, Unit Cost, Amount, Revenue Rate, and Amount Revenue.</p>
<p>Corrects the calculation of the Recurring Lines Amount field based on the Quantity and Cost; previously, this calculation only supported Amounts under 100.00.</p>
<h3>3.3.1 Release Recurring AP Journal</h3>
<p>Previously, we enabled the IgnoreCase3193 registry option to allow users to enter (among other things) a bank account on the Recurring AP Journal Recurring Lines tab to support credit card/eft processing. In earlier versions, the Release Recurring AP Journal function did not evaluate this setting, and the post failed if a bank (or other denied) account was found. This problem has been corrected so the Release function successfully evaluates the sys-viewer-vrcrrngapjrnl for the IgnoreCase3193 option.</p>
<h2>3.4 AP Date To Pay (Select Invoices for Payment)</h2>
<p>Changing the Vendor Invoice # on AP Journal entries could result in incorrect amounts on the AP Check if Select Invoices for Payment was sitting open WHILE the AP Journal entry was being changed. Select Invoices for Payment now skips the update if the Vendor Invoice 'original' Invoice Amount / Id has changed while it is executing.</p>
<p>Discounts to credit memos are now correctly applied. Previously a $100 CM with a $5 discount was incorrectly calculated as -$105; now it is correctly calculated as -$95. The spurious error message 'discounts not allowed for credit memos' has also been eliminated.</p>
<p>The AP Date to Pay list is sorted as follows: Vendor Alpha Id, Vendor Id, and Vendor Invoice Number. Previously, the Vendor Alpha was not displayed on the list, leading to some confusion regarding the order. In this release, the Vendor Alpha field is displayed below the AP Invoice Id on the last column.</p>
<h2>3.5 Purchase Order</h2>
<p>Previously, Revenue was not properly calculated when JCH Cost was zero. In this release, the Revenue is now computed for unit price Inventory and General lines when the Job Quantity Received is not zero.</p>
<p>In this release, the Work Order information from the PO Header is not defaulted to the Inventory Tab until a Quantity is entered. This corrects a problem in Version 8.0.510.036 which occurred if you <font style="text-decoration: underline;">manually</font> entered the WO Id in the PO header: this resulted in the Work Order information being immediately being written to the first Inventory line.</p>
<p>This release corrects a ‘Record not found’ error if the user manually entered the Equipment Id on the Inventory, General or Subcontractor tabs.</p>
<p>In this release, the user’s Id only defaults if the Ordered By field is blank when the purchase order is added.</p>
<p>This release corrects a problem introduced in 8.0.510.018 that occurs if a PO with a GEN line that has a single-quote in its Description field is loaded into the PO viewer.</p>
<p>New validation prevents the change/deletion of any PO Inventory or General line which has been marked as Complete in the Inventory Receipts Journal. This prevents negative on-order amounts from appearing in inventory history.</p>
<p>This release handles the specific case where the Tax Group is blank in the PO header but a use-tax Work Order/Job is specified. Previously, the Tax Cost was not calculated if the Cost Category was defaulted from the Inventory Group. The use Tax Cost is now calculated correctly.</p>
<p>Corrects extraneous “WARNING: the changes made to record ....” when switching between unchanged PO’s by selecting from the list or by entering a valid Id in the PO Id field.</p>
<h3>3.5.1 Vendor Sales Tax</h3>
<p>This release corrects a problem where Vendor Tax was configured (job cost checked for Sales Tax Authority lines in the Sales Tax group viewer) and the item was received on the Purchase Order. In the case of non-use tax Jobs, Tax Cost was calculated and written to history if it were to a Use Tax Job. In this release, Purchase Orders to non-use tax jobs now are consistent with receipting in the Inventory Receipts Journal: Tax Cost remains at 0.00 and no Tax History is written.</p>
<h3>3.5.2 IMH Tab</h3>
<p>Previously, this tab was sorted by Part/Description, Effective Date, and then Source Journal alphabetically.&#160;&#160;In this release, the Source Journal part is ordered by Purchase, then Receipts, and finally AP Journal vouchering to be more in tune with the way things normally happen.</p>
<h3>3.5.3 Inventory Tab</h3>
<p>TechAnywhere-generated Purchase Orders no longer default the Job Quantity Ordered/Received when the Quantity Ordered/Received is changed to prevent double-costing.</p>
<p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">&#160;</p>
<h2>3.6 Vendor Viewer</h2>
<p>The system now includes retainage paid in the calculation of the Payments column for the Vendor’s PaidInvoices and Payments tabs</p>
<p>The zip code from the Vendor Mailing Address has been added as a range on the Filter screen.</p>
<h2>3.7 PO Reorder Advice Report</h2>
<p><font style="font-weight: bold;">PO Reorder Advice Report:</font> This report may now be run from the Scheduled Report Manager with the “Restrict To Location Filter Only” option checked.</p>
<p>Now supports Security at the Location level.</p>
<p>PO-related data are now combined by the base PO Id to prevent inconsistent reporting when Change Orders are involved.</p>
<p><font style="font-weight: bold;">New Field</font> <font style="font-weight: bold;">- Restrict to Location</font> <font style="font-weight: bold;">Filter</font> <font style="font-weight: bold;">Only</font><font style="font-weight: bold;">?<br /></font>If you check this field the items on this report will be restricted to those needed at locations defined by the Location Id: range. Other stock locations that have the item available for possible transfer will NOT appear on the report if this box is checked.</p>
<h3>3.7.1 Reorder Advice Registry Option to show Site Name</h3>
<p>You have the option of showing the Site Name for work orders, client orders, purchase orders and/or shop orders. The Site is derived from work order, job and/or client order as needed.</p>
<p><font style="font-weight: bold;">Id:</font> sys-report-rrordradvce</p>
<p><font style="font-weight: bold;">Setting Key:</font> ShowSiteInfo</p>
<p><font style="font-weight: bold;">Setting Value:</font> WorkOrder,ClientOrder,PurchaseOrder,ShopOrder</p>
<p>You may specify as many of the above values as needed.</p>
<p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">&#160;</p>
<h2>3.8 Vendor Invoice</h2>
<p>Internal verification added to prevent sporadic setting of the user/date/time approved fields when the invoice had not been approved.</p>
<h2>3.9 Taylor EPOs</h2>
<p>This release supports Taylor Electronic Parts Orders. SAMPro can now generate an electronic parts order that may be transmitted to Taylor via secure ftp program.&#160;</p>
<p><img src="image/CreateEPO.gif" alt="image\CreateEPO.gif" title="image\CreateEPO.gif" width="73" height="28" align="left" border="0" /> A new bitmap, Create EPO, has been added to the Purchase Order’s Main tab for Taylor customizations (and customizations using the Taylor customization. This button launches the report described below.</p>
<p>A SAMPro User Defined report, Report Taylor Electronic Parts Order (RTYLREPOEXPRT.rpt) must be imported to support this function. The user will have an option to print an audit report OR print the export file. To save the export file the user must save the report as a text file and then rename the file with the correct file name.</p>
<p>The following fields are displayed on the Audit Report:</p>
<p style="margin-left: 36.00pt;">Order Type (from the registry or PO User1)</p>
<p style="margin-left: 36.00pt;">Account Number (from the registry)</p>
<p style="margin-left: 36.00pt;">Ship To (from the registry or 1<font style="vertical-align: super;">st</font> four characters of the Location Id)</p>
<p style="margin-left: 36.00pt;">Order Date (from the Purchase Order’s Date Released)</p>
<p style="margin-left: 36.00pt;">Zip Code (from the Location record)</p>
<p style="margin-left: 36.00pt;">Item No/Quantity/Unit of Measure (from the Purchase Order Inventory Tab)</p>
<h3>3.9.1 Taylor EPO Registry Settings</h3>
<p>The following registry settings are required for the correct operation of this functionality.</p>
<p><font style="font-weight: bold;">Id:</font> sys-report-rtylrepoexprt</p>
<p><font style="font-weight: bold;">Setting Key:</font> OrderType&#160;&#160;<font style="font-weight: bold;">Setting Value:</font> <font style="font-style: italic;">defaulttype</font> (typically J)</p>
<p>The Order Type will first look at the first character of the purchase order user 1 field. If this is not filled in, the report will look at the registry entry.</p>
<p><font style="font-weight: bold;">Setting Key:</font> DefaultShipVia &#160;<font style="font-weight: bold;">Setting Value:</font> <font style="font-style: italic;">defaultshipvia</font> (typically A)</p>
<p>The Ship Via field will be filled first from the DefaultShipVia registry entry if one exists. If the DefaultShipVia registry entry does not exist, the field will be filled from the first character of the purchase order user 2 field.</p>
<p><font style="font-weight: bold;">Setting Key</font>: AccountNo&#160;<font style="font-weight: bold;">Setting Value:</font> <font style="font-style: italic;">provided by Taylor</font></p>

<p>The Ship To field on the report will be filled first from this ShipTo registry entry if one exists. If the ShipTo registry entry does not exist, the field will be filled from the first 4 characters of the Location Id referenced in the purchase order. This should be blank unless the distributor has multiple locations.<br /></p>
<h2>3.10 Canadian Accounts Payable AFT</h2>
<p>This enhancement implements the electronic funds transfer of AP checks for our Canadian customers to Canadian banks.</p>
<p>To distinguish between the Report AFT for Payroll and Accounts Payable, Report AFT will no longer be used: instead, Report AFT Accounts Payable and Report AFT Payroll will be listed. Note that you may need to run Start Function Update to see these functions. Verify that they are assigned to the appropriate User Groups.</p>
<h3>3.10.1 Vendor Viewer</h3>
<p><font style="font-weight: bold;">New Fields:</font></p>

<h3>3.10.3 Report AFT AP Registry for Canadian AP Direct Deposit</h3>
<h3>Purpose:</h3>
<p class="Reference_Line" style="margin-bottom: 0.00pt;">An AFT registry entry must be created for each GL Account and GL Entity combination for which you will be generating direct deposit AP checks. Your Vendors/Vendor’s banks will provide details on the necessary Vendor account and Bank EFT (routing) numbers.</p>
<h3>Usage:</h3>
<p>This entry is designed for use with Canadian AP processing.</p>
<h3>Important Fields:</h3>
<p><font style="font-weight: bold;">Id:</font></p>

<h3>3.10.3a &#160;Registry Entries for Check Values Exceeding $20,000</h3>
<p>The following changes were made to support the alternate, higher security submission mechanism rules implemented by the Royal Bank of Canada for payments larger than $20,000.00.</p>
<p>If any AP AFT checks will be generated in the amount of $20,000, the &#160;RBC header line in the output file must be disabled through the following registry entries (note that all Setting Values are empty). &#160;This is done through the following options for sys-aftap<font style="font-style: italic;">-glbankaccountid</font>- registry entries:</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: bold;">Setting Key:</span> Format &#160;&#160;&#160;<span style="font-weight: bold;">Setting Value:</span><br />
<span style="font-weight: bold;">Setting Key:</span> TestFileHeader &#160;&#160;<span style="font-weight: bold;">Setting Value:</span><br />
<span style="font-weight: bold;">Setting Key:</span> ProdFileHeader &#160;&#160;<span style="font-weight: bold;">Setting Value:</span></p>
<p>This format is also acceptable for lower dollar amount AP AFT checks.</p>
<p>'C' Lines Characters 194-202 must also be filled with '000000000' via the following option:</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: bold;">Setting Key:</span> edIDReturns &#160;&#160;<span style="font-weight: bold;">Setting Value:</span> 000000000</p>
<p>The following programmatic changes in this version also support the higher security submission mechanism rules as well as the submission of lower dollar payments:</p>
<p style="margin-left: 48px;">'C' Lines Characters 254-264 are filled with blanks.<br />
'Z' Lines Characters 69-1464 are filled with zeros.</p>
<h3>3.10.4 Print AP Checks</h3>
<p><font style="font-weight: bold;">New Field: EFT Trx #:<br /></font>This display-only field lists the next EFT transaction number available for the GL Account / GL Entity combination.</p>
<p>When AP Checks are printed, AFT Checks will NOT be included as a memo (as they are in Payroll). An auto-generated EFT Transaction # will be used as an identifying number for these EFT’s.</p>
<p>When the checks have been printed, a message will appear indicating that EFT Transactions were processed.</p>
<p>The EFT’s will appear on the Post/Void checklist.</p>
<p>An audit report (REFTCHCKDTL.rpt) will then be launched, filtered to the EFT transactions just posted. This report is described below: it may be run stand-alone to review previous transactions.</p>
<h3>3.10.5 Report EFT AP Detail</h3>
<p>This report (REFTCHCKDTL.rpt) must be imported into your database.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">&#160;</p>
<h3>3.10.6 Report AFT Accounts Payable</h3>
<p><font style="font-weight: bold;">Purpose:</font></p>
<p>The Report AFT AP function should be run <font style="font-weight: bold;">after</font> the Print AP Checks function has been completed. This function is designed to generate the AFT (Automated File Transfer) AP file that will be transmitted for direct deposits. It will also create a printed AFT report for your records. After printing the report, you will be asked to confirm that an electronic file should be created.</p>
<p><font style="font-weight: bold;">Usage:</font></p>
<p>A registry entry (see release note 3.10.3 above) must be in place for each GL Account/GL Entity combination for which you intend to create direct deposit files. In addition, the EFT Bank Id and Account fields must be completed in the Vendor records.</p>

If a GL Entity was specified in the Print AP Check function, the appropriate GL Entity Id must also be specified here.</p>
<p><font style="font-weight: bold;">Include Checks?</font> <font style="font-weight: bold;"><br /></font>This field must be checked in order to generate the AFT file.</p>
<p><font style="font-weight: bold;">File Creation No:<br /></font>This field will be included in the generated file for tracking purposes. It will default based on the GL Account and Entities that you select.</p>
<h3>3.10.7 Report EFT AP Check Detail Vendor</h3>
<p>This new user report (REFTCHCKDTLVNDR.rpt) must be imported into your database. It is designed to be run and automatically e-mail to your vendors, alerting them that they been paid.</p>
<p>The registry described in the following section (3.10.8) is required to auto-email and autosave (if desired) the report.</p>
<p>The report will list the Id, Name and Address of the Vendor, followed by the</p>
<p style="text-indent: 30.25pt;">Check Number – Date – Void Date (if applicable) – Check Amount</p>
<p style="text-indent: 30.25pt;">Description – PO Number – Invoice No. – Date – Invoice Amt – Amt Pd – Discount – Net Paid</p>

When this report is run stand-alone, these ranges may be completed to filter the report to specific EFT checks.</p>
<h3>3.10.8 Registry for Report EFT AP Check Detail Vendor</h3>
<p>This new report has functionality for autosave, autoemail &amp; emailby section logic. The following setting keys may be applicable:</p>
<p><font style="font-weight: bold;">Id:</font> sys-report-reftchckdtlvndr<br /></p>
<p><font style="font-weight: bold;">Autoemail Options</font></p>
<p style="margin-left: 36.00pt;"><font style="font-weight: bold;">Important:</font> the Vendor Email address specific in the sys-viewer-vvndr registry discussed in section 3.10.2 will be used to email your vendors their reports.</p>

<p>&#160;</p>
<h2>3.11 Start Generate POs</h2>
<h3>3.11.1 New Fields on List/Edit Screen:</h3>
<p><font style="font-weight: bold;">Promise Date:</font></p>
<p>The user may complete this field; it will be written to the Purchase Order.</p>
<p><font style="font-weight: bold;">LTB Vendor Id: LTB Date:<br />
Last Time Bought Vendor Name:<br /></font>These fields display the Last Time Bought information for this Location/Item.</p>
<h3>3.11.2 New Functionality to Print the Purchase Orders</h3>
<p>When you click Go to generate the Purchase Orders, the system will display a message box confirming the number of Purchase Orders generated, and ask “Print PO Forms?”</p>
<p>Click ‘Yes’ to launch the PO report pre-filtered to the POs generated, or ‘No’ to simply acknowledged the message.</p>
<h2>3.12 Clear Accounts Payable Checks</h2>
<p>This release corrects a “Runtime Error: illegal character in format” that occurred if the user attempted to clear a credit memo EFT or Credit Card entry what result in a negative ‘check’ amount. In this release, both positive and negative EFT's and Credit card entries will clear.</p>
<h1>4 Client, Site and Equipment</h1>
<h2>4.1 Client Site viewer</h2>
<p>A Description column has been added to the Client Site viewer's WO Open and WO Other lists. This new field displays the Work Order Name.</p>
<p>This release handles an error that occurred when the Sage Quest interface was on and the user loaded a client site record with the Site Latitude field is blank, and Work/Ship Street Address includes the @ character.</p>
<h2>4.2 Client Site Equipment viewer</h2>
<p>Corrects extraneous ‘Change Record?’ messages when switching from one (unchanged) record to another (e.g., from the Work Order detail tabs).</p>
<h3>4.2.1 Client Site Equipment PM Schedule</h3>
<p><font style="font-weight: bold;">New Field (click Magnify button to access) - Cycle Code Filter:</font></p>
<p>This filter is used by SAMPro and TechAnywhere to filter PM Work Order Log Form Metrics lists for this piece of Equipment. Multiple cycle codes may be entered as a comma-delimited list. Note that Log Form field in the Client Site Equipment record determines which list of metrics is used.</p>
<p>If this field is blank, the system will use the Cycle Code in the Work Code instead. Only those metrics whose CC: field corresponds to the filter or is blank will be written to the Work Order (for Techs without remote access) or uploaded to the Technician’s device. If the Cycle Code filter in both the Schedule and Work Code are blank, all metrics from the Log form will be written to the Metrics tab.</p>
<p>If one or more Cycle Codes are listed, only those metrics whose CC: field corresponds to this field or is blank will be written to the Work Order (for Techs without remote access) or uploaded to the Technician’s device.</p>
<p>See user notes 12.5-12.7 for additional details.</p>
<p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">&#160;</p>
<h2>4.3 Start Import Client Site</h2>
<p>Corrects a problem where addresses were not updated from the .cvs file if the client site name was 40 characters long with an embedded single quote.</p>
<p>In previous releases, phone numbers had to conform to the SAMPro (###)###-#### format to import correctly. In this release, if the .CSV phone fields contain any of the following formats they will be saved to SAMPro correctly: ###-###-#### OR (###)###-#### OR ##########</p>
<p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">&#160;</p>
<h2>4.4 Client</h2>
<h3>4.4.1 Client Collections</h3>
<p><img src="image/CreateBook.gif" alt="image\CreateBook.gif" title="image\CreateBook.gif" width="94" height="28" border="0" /> A new button, Generate PDF Book, has been added to the Client Collections screen. When clicked, it will launch Book Viewer with the current Client Id filled in. The Book Viewer may be used to assemble invoices and other collateral as a package that can be then e-mailed to the Client.</p>
<p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">&#160;</p>
<h1>5 Invoicing and AR</h1>
<h2>5.1 AR Sales Journal</h2>
<p>This release corrects a spurious Tab Mismatch error for Bad Debt entries.</p>
<p>Validation has been added to prevent the user from changing the Entry Type on an existing entry. By default, the Entry Type may only be changed in the Sale Journal is in ‘add’ mode. A registry entry (NOT recommended) overrides the above validation; see user note 2.6.2.</p>
<h2>5.2 Service Invoice</h2>
<p>When Service Invoices are printed, the user is asked to confirm that the invoices printed correctly. Prior to this change, the database was not rolled back until the user closed the Invoices Preview screen.&#160;&#160;In this release, the ROLLBACK occurs as soon as the user answers NO to the 'ok to post' prompt.&#160;&#160;This minimizes the time frame in which a problem can occur.</p>
<p>This release corrects a "keys" not understood error that occurred when Compute Service Billing was run for a COD work order where it had already been billed successfully.&#160;</p>
<h3>5.2.1 COD Work Orders and Template Clients</h3>
<p>New validation ensures that template-type clients are only billed when the net invoice amount is exactly ZERO DOLLARS.</p>
<p>The Service Billing Worksheet report has been modified to display a very noticeable warning for each WO/Job invoice that would result in a template-type client being billed for any amount other than zero. The Service Worksheet report (SERVICEWORKSHEETv73b032.rpt dated 11/22/2011) must be imported to support this functionality.</p>
<p>The following changes have been added to the process of preparing Service Invoices:</p>
<p style="margin-left: 36.00pt;">When the Service Invoice report is run, the system compiles a list of each WO/Job combination for which a Template Clients would be billed a non-zero amount. This list will be displayed in a workspace viewer that the user may choose to close or print.</p>
<p style="margin-left: 36.00pt;">In addition, the system auto-saves the compiled list as a text file. If the dbreportfiles registry entry exists, the system will use it to get the location to save the file with the Template Client errors. If the dbreportfiles registry entry does not exist, the Sampro base directory will be used to save the file with the Template Client errors.</p>
<p style="margin-left: 36.00pt;">Work Orders that make this list CANNOT be included in the invoicing run.</p>
<h2>5.3 AR Cash Receipts Journal</h2>
<p>This release corrects a very sporadic “Invalid Column name 'invcemstr_id' encountered by some users.</p>
<p>Previously, the sidebar Attachment, Notes, and Scanning buttons were not available unless you manually Refreshed after adding a record. The side button bar is now refreshed after a journal entry is added.</p>
<p>In the Enter Invoices screen; the Remove Invoice button now correctly removes the selected line.</p>
<h3>5.3.1 Unapplied AR Cash Receipts</h3>
<p>Previously, Unapplied Cash Receipts only supported 4 digit numbers, allowing only 9998 entries (UN0001- UN9999) entries to be made. This release enhances unapplied numbering to accommodate 6-digit numbers. NOTE: the first number allocated by the new code will be 'UN100001'.</p>
<p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">&#160;</p>
<h2>5.4 Record Billing Adjustments</h2>
<p>The Record Billing Adjustments Description is now written to the AR Sales Journal Transaction Description when the invoice is posted. The Invoice Register report (which uses the AR Sales Description) will now provide more complete information.</p>
<h3>5.4.1 Billing Tab – New Retainage Options</h3>
<p>You must click the magnify button to access these options.</p>
<p>This release supports an enhancement to the way retainage works to accommodate new laws in Alabama (and possibly other states) where the retainage percent may change as the job progresses.&#160;</p>
<p>Additional options have been implemented for specifying the Next Invoice Retainage value for a Billing Item.&#160;Five options are provided ... Normal, Current, Hold, Manual and Release All. The option name in use will appear to the right of the Next Inv. Retainage field.<br />
<br />
<img src="image/NormalRetainage.gif" alt="image\NormalRetainage.gif" title="image\NormalRetainage.gif" width="94" height="28" border="0" /> ‘’Normal‘’ is the current SAMPro behavior and is still the default option – the Total Invoice times the Retainage %. If the user wishes to adjust the Retainage percent, clicking the Normal‘’ button will recompute the Next Invoice Retainage field.</p>
<p>&#160;&#160;<img src="image/CurrentRetainage.gif" alt="image\CurrentRetainage.gif" title="image\CurrentRetainage.gif" width="94" height="28" border="0" /> Current means apply the Retainage % to the Next Invoice Total only.’ This allows the user to lower the Retainage % without releasing previously held retainage values. To switch to this option, the user must push the new button labeled Current.</p>
<p><img src="image/HoldRetainage.gif" alt="image\HoldRetainage.gif" title="image\HoldRetainage.gif" width="94" height="28" border="0" /> Hold means no more retainage should be withheld but DOES NOT release previously held retainage values. To switch to this option, the user must push the new button labeled Hold. Manual indicates the user has manually entered a value in the Next Invoice Retainage field and tabbed out of the field. No button is required for this option</p>
<p><img src="image/ReleaseAllRetainage.gif" alt="image\ReleaseAllRetainage.gif" title="image\ReleaseAllRetainage.gif" width="94" height="28" border="0" /> Clicking the ‘’Release All button sets the Retainage % to zero and computes:</p>
<p style="margin-left: 36.00pt;">Next Inv. Retainage = (Retainage Invoiced-to-Date)x(-1)</p>
<p style="margin-left: 36.00pt;">This action would normally occur at the end of the job when it’s time to send the final bill: the word ‘Normal’ will appear next to the Next Inv. Retainage field.</p>
<h2>5.5 Start Job Invoice Reverse</h2>
<p>Corrects a “Runtime Error: receiver is not a Boolean” when a user attempted to reverse a construction-type invoice for a job on which they had already started producing a new invoice.&#160;&#160;The revised code now alerts the user to the problem (the job's Invoice Status was set to 'Printed' and the reverse is disallowed) before the error occurs.</p>
<h2>5.6 Start Job Invoice Posting</h2>
<p>The Record Billing Adjustments Description is now written to the AR Sales Journal Transaction Description when the invoice is posted. The Invoice Register report (which uses the AR Sales Description) will now provide more complete information.</p>
<p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">&#160;</p>
<h1>6 General Ledger</h1>
<h2>6.1 GL Account Type</h2>
<p>This release implements additional ways of classifying GL Account Types for use with DB Analytics.</p>

<p>SAMPro will continue to use the old Account Type Category field, but DB Analytics will use the new Category field. Therefore, if DB Analytics will be implemented, support or a designated user should categorize the new field in all existing GL Account Type records.</p>
<h2>6.2 GL Account</h2>
<p><font style="font-weight: bold;">New Field: Category</font></p>
<p>The display-only Category field defaults from the GL Account Type record.</p>
<h2>6.3 GL Reporting Period</h2>
<p>Corrects a problem in recent releases where GL Reporting Periods could not be deleted.</p>
<p>The help link for this function has been corrected, and no longer displays a warning when you click help. It may be necessary to run Start Function List Update to see this change.</p>
<h2>6.4 Bank Reconciliation Journal</h2>
<p style="margin-left: 8px;">This release improves performance when toggling detail lines.</p>
<p>Validation has been added to deny a change to the GL Account or Entity when the viewer is not in Add mode. If the viewer is in Add mode, changing the GL Account and/or Entity fields automaticallys clear all child lines forcing the user to Auto-Fill for the currently selected GL Account/Entity combination.</p>
<p>The system validates that the Accounting Period is Active before allowing the user to continue with the reconciliation.</p>
<p>The system now allows an unbalanced transaction to be saved, but does not post it to GL. Once the transaction is completed and balanced, it will be posted to GL when it is saved.</p>
<p>The Auto Fill button has been enhanced. If the user clicks the Auto Fill button in an existing entry which may be changed (the most recent entry for the selected GL Entity/ GL Account combination), the system now asks “Retain previously record reconciliation info?”. If Yes is clicked, the system will merge existing transaction lines with any un-reconciled lines that are discovered. If No is clicked, existing transaction lines will be replaced by all un-reconciled lines, enabling you to restart the entry as in previous releases.</p>
<p>The system will prevent a new entry for the same GL Account/Entity if an unreconciled entry is found.</p>
<h2>6.5 GL Trial Balance Report</h2>
<p>This release corrects a problem where the names of all GL Accounts (including those not in the User’s Security) were printed if the Consolidated report option was selected.</p>
<h2>6.6 Bank Deposit Journal</h2>
<p>In this release, validation prevents Bank Deposit journal entries from being deleted if the Accounting Period is inactive.</p>
<h3>6.7 Bank Transfer Journal</h3>
<p>In this release, validation prevents Bank Transfer journal entries from being deleted if the Accounting Period is inactive.</p>
<h1>7 Job Costing</h1>
<h2>7.1 Start Job Cost Allocation</h2>
<p>This release corrects the Start Job Cost Allocation ‘Key is missing’ error that occurred when attempting to enter the Start Date.</p>
<h2>7.2 Job Journal</h2>
<p>This release corrects a sporadic error that resulted in the Job Journal posting incorrect reversals to GL history.</p>
<h3>7.2.1 Expenses Tab</h3>
<p>The GL Account now defaults from the Job Cost Category when the Other Rate Id is entered before the Cost Category. In addition, validation has been added to make the GL Account a required field when a post to GLH is required.</p>
<p>The Extended Revenue now automatically defaults if the Billing Item is not Fixed Fee. For Billing Items that are flagged as Fixed Fee, Allow Extras, it is still necessary to flag the Extra box in order for the Extended Revenue field to default.</p>
<h3>7.2.2 Co. Assets Tab</h3>
<p>The GL Account now defaults from the Job Cost Category when the Other Rate Id is entered before the Cost Category. In addition, validation has been added to make the GL Account a required field when a post to GLH is required.</p>
<p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">&#160;</p>
<h2>7.3 Job Billing Item</h2>
<p>Corrects extraneous ‘Change Record?’ messages when switching from one (unchanged) record to another (e.g., from the Work Order detail tabs).</p>
<p>The Job Id is now a required field in this record.</p>
<h2>7.4 Job Cost Code</h2>
<p>Corrects extraneous ‘Change Record?’ messages when switching from one (unchanged) record to another (e.g., from the Work Order detail tabs).</p>
<p>The Job Id is now a required field in this record.</p>
<h2>7.5 Project Manager Workbench</h2>
<p>In this release, users with read only-access are now able to use the following functions without limitation if their user-group security gives them access: QuoteMaster, Purchase Order, Job Progress Update, Notes and Attachments.</p>
<p>Previously, if items were received for a PO, and then the PO was changed (creating an -01 entry) they no longer display as received on the Material PO tab. This has been corrected.</p>
<p>Now handles Long Strings in Document Replacement for MS Office 2010.</p>
<p>The Progress tab now displays the Job Progress information correctly; in previous releases it was not displayed.</p>
<h3>7.5.1 &#160;Project Manager Workbench / External Apps</h3>
<p>As we have done in the WO, Quote, PO and Shop Packet in previous SAMPro versions, this enhancement allows Crystal Reports to pick up the specific ID (Job ID in this case) that is currently active in the program (PM Workbench in this case). With this new ability, Crystal Report Functions added to the Reports tab of the PM Workbench do not require the user to enter in the Job ID if the report is job based. The Crystal Report must use a parameter named exactly jb_id in order for it to have SAMPro pass it to the report.</p>
<p>In the specific example of how it is being used, the Client wanted to print out a “log record” of Submittals and RFI requests made for the job so that they could give that document to the Client/Architect. Without this enhancement, they would have to double-click on the Crystal Report Function in the Reports tab and remember the job id so they could manually fill it in. With this feature, the user immediately gets the report to run with no interaction for that specific job they are on.</p>
<h3>7.5.2 Quote Enhancements</h3>
<p><font style="font-weight: bold;">New Button: Create Quote</font></p>
<p>The Create Quote button launches the Quote viewer to allow Quotes to be generated for the selected Job. The Job/Site Id will be defaulted to the new Quote.</p>
<p><font style="font-weight: bold;">New Tab: Quotes</font></p>
<p>This new tab displays the Quotes associated with the selected Job. Doubling-clicking on a line will open the selected Quote.</p>
<p>A Quote will appear on this tab if the Job Id is completed in the Quote header. A Quote will also be displayed if its Job Id is blank but the Work Order Id is completed and references the selected Job. The following fields are displayed:</p>
<p><font style="font-weight: bold;">Quote Id - Description – DateOpened – Status</font></p>
<p>These fields default from the Quote header.</p>
<p><font style="font-weight: bold;">Equipment Id – Option – Bill Item Id – Bill Item Status – Price – Scope</font></p>
<p>These fields default from the Quote Scope tab. Note that the Bill Item Id and the Bill Item Status are only completed if a Change Order Billing Item has been generated for the specified option.</p>
<h3>7.5.3 Cost Details Tab</h3>
<p>A new tab, Cost Details, has been added to this viewer. For each Job Cost Code/Cost Category combination the following columns are displayed:</p>
<p style="margin-left: 36.00pt;">Hours To Date: Labor, Material, Other and Subcontract Cost to Date, and Committed Costs</p>
<h3>7.5.4 Budget Tab</h3>
<p>The GL Entry is now written to Job History for Budget entries generated from this tab.</p>
<h3>7.5.5 Cost Codes Tab</h3>
<p>In this release, the Cost Codes List has been enhanced to present information similar to the JC Summary parent tab.</p>
<p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">&#160;</p>
<p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">&#160;</p>
<h2>7.6 Job</h2>
<p>This release corrects a display issue on the JC Summary tab: moving the mouse within this tab no longer results in buttons from the Main or Invoicing tabs showing through.</p>
<h3>7.6.1 Job Budget Entry Tab</h3>
<p>Previously, the Import Budget function ignored the inventory cost on the spreadsheet, and instead used the cost from the Inventory record.&#160;In this release, the Import uses the Inventory Cost as entered on the spreadsheet when generating the Budget Entry lines.</p>
<p>The GL Entity is now written to Job History for Budget entries generated from this tab.</p>
<p>Both forwarding and reversing budget entries are now made for entries on the Job’s Budget tab if you change the Job’s Id; previously, only forwarding budget entries were made.</p>
<p>The Import Budget function now supports negative hours and quantities in the .cvs import file. Negative hours/quantities result in negative extended costs/revenues when the budget is imported.</p>
<p><font style="font-weight: bold;">New Field (click Magnify button): Date Effective</font></p>
<p>This field will be used by the system when writing entries to Job History from this tab, unless overridden by the registry (see above). If the BudgetEffectiveDate job registry option is set to currentdate or DateOpened, the user will be warned and entry in this field will be denied.</p>
<p>See user note 2.17 for details on this registry option.</p>
<h3>7.6.2 Job Revenues Tab</h3>
<p>This release includes improved handling of the Billed field. .</p>
<p>This release corrects a problem on the Revenues tab caused by a Purchase Order Subcontract line with a Contract Total Amount greater than 999,999.999.</p>
<h3>7.6.3 Job Cloning</h3>
<p>Validation during the Job Cloning process now prevents the user from specifying an existing Job Id. In this release, if an existing Job Id is entered in the Job Clone Wizard, the message “New Job Id already exists, this job cannot be used” will be displayed, and the existing job will not be overwritten.</p>
<p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">&#160;</p>
<h2>7.7 Job History</h2>
<p>Forwarding/reversing entries are now written to Job History when the Client Site Equipment Id is the only field changed in Work Order, Labor, and Job Journal detail lines.</p>
<h2>7.8. Job Invoicing</h2>
<p>New validation included in this release prevents sporadic problems with double invoicing due to the simultaneous use of the Invoice Master, Reverse Job Invoice, AR Sales Journal and Work Order functions for the same Job.</p>
<p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">&#160;</p>
<h1>8 Inventory</h1>
<h2>8.1 Location viewer</h2>
<p>The Location record now displays correctly if one or more inventory items on the Location Items tab have a quantity-on-hand of 100,000 or more.</p>
<h3>8.1.1 Location and Work Order Inventory / GL Entity</h3>
<p>This release changes the behavior when posting WO-INV entries to GL History.&#160;&#160;Previously, the GLH Credit never included a GL Entity.&#160;&#160;In this release, the system ALWAYS uses the GL Entity from the WO-INV line's Location record. Set the GL Entity in the Location record to ensure that the Credit GL Entity defaults properly when items are entered on the Work Order Inventory tab.</p>
<h2>8.2 Physical Count Processing</h2>
<p>The Inventory Item Name has been added as a display field in the list.</p>
<p>This release corrects a ‘Batch Number Mis-Match’ error when importing entries from a previously exported .csv file.</p>
<p>It also corrects a problem in the List Physical Count report: the List Missing Items option and the First / Last Uncounted fields, now work properly.</p>
<h3>8.2.1 Export Files</h3>
<p>This release refines the Export Files function so the only parts with actual "on-hand activity" within the specified activity appear in the exported file. In particular,</p>
<p style="margin-left: 36.00pt;">Parts that were ordered on a Drop Ship PO do not impact On Hand quantities, and are no longer used when determining inventory "On Hand Activity"</p>
<p style="margin-left: 36.00pt;">Parts that were ordered on a PO and linked directly to a Workorder do not effect On Hand quantities, and are no longer used when determining inventory "On Hand Activity"</p>
<h2>8.3 Inventory Item Viewer</h2>
<p>The system now posts positive quantities before negative quantities in the reversal process. This prevents the computed average cost from being set to zero if the location’s stock is very low.</p>
<p>In recent versions, if the Id field was changed and then the record was saved, the Location and other children were lost; this has been corrected. Note that if other fields must also be changed, the record must be saved before changing the Id.</p>
<p>The Equipment Type Id has been added as a Range Field to the Filter Screen.</p>
<h3>8.3.1 Main Tab</h3>
<p>This release corrects a formatting problem where double-clicking on the Miscellaneous box set the Purchase Complete box instead.</p>
<p><font style="font-weight: bold;">New Field: Obsolete?<br /></font>If the Inactive flag is checked, this item may not be entered on Purchase Orders, but may be entered on Work Orders and Client Orders (to use up existing stock). If the Obsolete flag is also checked, you may not enter this record on anything – Work Orders, Purchase Orders, Client Orders, Job Journal, etc.</p>
<p>This field effectively produces a 2-tier system for managing inventory. Inactive Items would be ones that you didn't want to purchase, but were still in stock. Once the item was depleted, it could be flagged as Obsolete so it could not be entered on anything.</p>
<p>The system will automatically set the Inactive flag when the user sets the Obsolete flag, but not the other way around. Clearing the Obsolete flag does not clear the Inactive flag.</p>
<p>Contact support if you would like to have a script run to set the Obsolete flag if the Inactive flag is set.</p>
<p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">&#160;</p>
<h2>8.4 Inventory Item Stock Status viewer</h2>
<p>This function now excludes non-inventory items. This release also corrects a display issue with the On Hand and Available quantities – these fields now correctly display.</p>
<h2>8.5 Inventory Receipts Journal</h2>
<p>In this release, users are allowed to un-receive partially vouchered purchases as long as a line’s total received is not less than the total vouchered.</p>
<p>Corrects ‘Key is Missing’ error in versions 8.0.510.011/012.</p>
<p>Corrects a problem where Use Tax was not correctly written to the Tax History table when items were received in this viewer.</p>
<h2>8.6 Inventory Adjustment Journal</h2>
<p>This release corrects a ‘Runtime error: Key is missing’ alert when tabbing out of the Location field in recent versions.</p>
<h2>8.7 Inventory Restock Processing</h2>
<p>The Bin Location (Pick Sequence) has been added to the Inventory Restocking Pick List.</p>
<p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">&#160;</p>
<h2>8.8 Return Authorization</h2>
<p>In previous releases, when a Serialized Item was returned to stock via a Return Authorization/AR Sales Credit Memo, it could not be selected for resale; this problem has been corrected.</p>
<p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">&#160;</p>
<h1>9 Asset Costing and Tracking</h1>
<h2>9.1 Asset viewer</h2>
<p>This release corrects a spurious ‘Job is a Template record’ message that previously occurred when the user attempted to clear the Default Overhead Job fields from the Costing tab.</p>
<p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">&#160;</p>
<h1>10 Payroll</h1>
<h2>10.1 Employee</h2>
<h3>10.1.1 Main Tab</h3>
<p><font style="font-weight: bold;">New Buttons: AddTech / EditTech<br /></font>If a Technician is already associated with Employee, clicking the Edit Tech displays the appropriate Technician record.</p>
<p>If a Technician is not yet associated with the Employee, clicking the Add Tech button will launch the Technician form, with the Employee Id and the following fields completed from the Employee viewer:</p>
<p>Technician Name (from the Employee First + Middle + Last Name fields)</p>
<p>Technician Cellphone (from the Employee Cellphone)</p>
<p>Technician Pager (from Employee Pager 1)</p>
<p>Technician Email (from Employee Email)</p>
<p>Technician Address (from Employee Mailing Address)</p>
<p>The user should then complete the remaining Technician fields (being sure to set the Web Access fields correctly) and save the record.</p>
<p><font style="font-weight: bold;">Changed Field: Social Security/SIN:<br /></font>If Payroll is enabled, the Social Security / SIN number will continue to be a required field. If Payroll is not enabled, the Social Security / SIN number is no longer required by the system.</p>
<p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">&#160;</p>
<h3>10.1.2 Checks Tab</h3>
<p>This release filters the Checks tab to exclude rows where both the Payroll Period and the Check Effective Date are empty (for example, checks manually entered on startup).</p>
<h3>10.1.3 Employee Viewer New Tab: Recurring Other</h3>
<h3>Purpose:</h3>
<p>This tab is used in conjunction with the Start Generate Recurring Labor Entries function to generate Labor Journal Other entries for expenses that will be applied to a job and reimbursed to the employee on his or her payroll check.</p>
<h3>Usage:</h3>
<p>Enter parking expense, cell phone charges, etc.</p>
<h3>Important Fields:</h3>
<p><font style="font-weight: bold;">Start Date:</font>&#160;<font style="font-weight: bold;">End Date:</font><br />
Enter starting and ending <font style="font-weight: bold;">working</font> dates to define the time period that this recurring entry is valid for. These fields are compared with the date range of the selected payroll period when the Generate Recurring Labor Entries function is run.</p>
<p><font style="font-weight: bold;">Cycle:<br /></font>This field defines the cycle for which this recurring entry would be generated. For example, Q (quarterly), W (weekly), P (payroll period) and so on.</p>
<p><font style="font-weight: bold;">Day:</font><br />
This field specifies which day in the payroll period the labor journal entry will be assigned to.</p>
<p><font style="font-weight: bold;">Other Rate Id: Quantity: Unit Cost: Amount Cost:<br /></font> The Other Rate Id: field is required; it provides the GL Account required during Compute Payroll. Note that although the Bill Type and Revenue Rate fields default from the Other Rate record, the Cost fields must be filled in if applicable.</p>
<p><font style="font-weight: bold;">Job Id: Cost Code: Cost Category:<br /></font>Complete these fields as you wish them to appear when the Labor Journal Entries are generated. Note that 'Operation Lockdown' validation is implemented so that the Cost Category’s Job Use field (All, Direct or Indirect) does not conflict with the status of the Overhead field in the Job record.</p>
<p><img src="image/magnifybutton.gif" alt="image\magnifybutton.gif" title="image\magnifybutton.gif" width="16" height="16" border="0" /> Click the Magnify button to view the following fields.</p>
<p><font style="font-weight: bold;">Billing Item:<br /></font> This field should be completed if this other charge is billable to the above Job.</p>
<p><font style="font-weight: bold;">WorkOrder Id:</font><br />
This field would only be completed if these recurring hours were charged to a specific work order. This is not recommended.</p>
<h3>10.1.4 Employee Deductions Tab</h3>
<p><font style="font-weight: bold;">New Deduction Limit Type: amount</font></p>
<p>A new Deduction Limit Type, ‘amount’, has been added. This new type would be used to handle loan repayments and other miscellaneous deductions whose payback time frames span calendar years (the previous Limit Types of pay period, monthly, annual, and quarterly did not support this functionality). Typically, the Deduction Limit Type of ‘amount’ would be used with an Amount Type of ‘percent’ with the Limit set to the total amount of the loan/garnishment.</p>
<p style="margin-left: 36.00pt;"><font style="text-decoration: underline;">Example:</font></p>
<p style="margin-left: 36.00pt;">In this example, a loan of 5000 is to be repaid at the rate of 5% per pay period. The following deduction could be set up:</p>
<p style="margin-left: 36.00pt;">Deduction Id: Loan</p>
<p style="margin-left: 36.00pt;">Ded Amount Type: percent</p>
<p style="margin-left: 36.00pt;">Amount: 5</p>
<p style="margin-left: 36.00pt;">Deduction Limit Type: amount</p>
<p style="margin-left: 36.00pt;">Limit: 5000</p>
<p style="margin-left: 36.00pt;">In this example, care must be taken to set the End Date far enough into the future that the loan can be repaid.</p>
<p style="margin-left: 36.00pt;">When the Limit is reached (or the End Date is past), this Deduction will no longer be taken.</p>
<h3>10.1.5 Earnings Tab</h3>
<p style="margin-left: 8px;"><span style="font-weight: bold;">Amount Field:</span><br />
Prevents truncation of the Unit Cost when hours for an Employee with a four-figure hourly earnings base are written to Job History.</p>
<p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">&#160;</p>
<h2>10.2 Report AFT (for Canadian PR Direct Deposit)</h2>
<p style="margin-left: 36.00pt;"><font style="font-weight: bold;">Note:</font> This release corrects the output format of the date fields in the "A" and "C" lines: 0yyddd. The day of the year (ddd) is now correctly output as 3 digits with leading zeros</p>
<h3>Purpose:</h3>
<p>This function is designed to generate the AFT (Automated File Transfer) file that will be transmitted for direct deposits. It will also create a printed AFT Register report for your records.</p>
<h3>Usage:</h3>
<p>An entry must be in place for each GL Account/GL Entity combination for which you intend to create direct deposit files. In addition, the Employee’s Deductions tab must be filled in with his or her direct deposit information.</p>

<p><img src="image/SKIN1_Go.gif" alt="image\SKIN1_Go.gif" title="image\SKIN1_Go.gif" width="94" height="28" border="0" /> Generate the AFT File and print the register.</p>
<h2>10.3 W2 Reporting</h2>
<p>Supports the formatting changes in the W3 form printed for 2011 taxes.</p>
<h2>10.4 Report PR Export</h2>
<p>Previously, this function attempted to consolidate multiple entries for the same date. In this release, these entries remain broken out as they should be.</p>
<h2>10.5 Labor Journal</h2>
<p style="margin-left: 6.50pt; margin-right: 1.50pt;">In the Labor Journal list, the "Description" Column has been added back to the LaborJournalByIdDateByDescription list as the "Transaction Description".</p>
<p>When a line is added to the Labor Journal or the Work Order Labor tab, the earnings and deductions groups for the default Pay Type now complete properly, and compute the pay and cost after all Technician defaults are loaded.</p>
<h2>10.6 Report PR Checks</h2>
<p style="margin-left: 6.50pt; margin-right: 1.50pt;">This version implements Security filtering when PR checks are printed so that the check run excludes employees whose Security Id does not match the Security Id of the user running Report PR Checks.</p>
<p>The Payroll Period Start and End dates, and the Check Date, have been added to the Recap portion of the Payroll Check stubs.</p>
<h2>10.7 Pay Type Record</h2>
<p><font style="font-weight: bold;">New Fields: PTO Accrual Exclusions</font></p>
<p style="margin-left: 36.00pt;">Exclude Regular?<br />
Exclude Overtime?<br />
Exclude Doubletime?<br />
Exclude Vacation?<br />
Exclude Holiday?<br />
Exclude Sick?<br />
Exclude Other?</p>
<p>Prior to this release, only vacation wages were excluded from the vacation accrual wage base.&#160;&#160;For example, when an employee takes a week of vacation, no additional vacation pay is earned for that week.&#160;&#160;The Province of Alberta allows the employer to excluded overtime wages as well.</p>
<p><font style="font-weight: bold;">These fields are only applicable if this Pay Type is set to PTO and the PTO Accrual Method is set to Percent.</font> If so, these fields enable the user to specify which types of Pay Types for Hours Worked will exclude this PTO Pay Rate from accrual.</p>
<p><font style="font-weight: bold;">Important Upgrade Note:</font> it is now necessary to flag Exclude Vacation for these wages to be excluded from the accrual wage base. After upgrading to version 8.0, carefully review your Pay Type records to see if any changes should be made.</p>
<p style="margin-left: 36.00pt;"><font style="text-decoration: underline;">Example:</font></p>
<p style="margin-left: 36.00pt;">For the case of Alberta, the fields would be set as follows for the Vacation PTO accrual:</p>
<p style="margin-left: 36.00pt;">Hours Type: PTO<br />
Category: Vacation<br />
PTO Accrual Method: Percent<br />
PTO Accrual Exclusions<br />
Flag the following: Exclude Overtime?, Exclude Doubletime?, Exclude Vacation?</p>
<h2><br />
10.8 Start Generate Recurring Labor Entries</h2>
<p>The system now considers the user's Security Id setting when selecting employees to process.&#160;</p>
<p>This function has been enhanced to support expenses entered on the Employee Recurring Other tab for expenses that will be applied to a job and reimbursed to the employee on his or her payroll check.</p>
<p style="margin-left: 36.00pt;"><font style="font-weight: bold;">Operation Lockdown:</font><br />
'Operation Lockdown' validation has also been implemented for Wages and Other expenses. If the Cost Category’s Job Use field (All, Direct or Indirect) conflicts with the status of the Overhead field in the Job record, a warning/error log will be displayed, and the Labor Journal transaction(s) will not be added. Typically, a suitable Cost Category should be selected on the Employee Recurring Wages/Recurring Other tabs before rerunning this function.</p>
<h2>10.9 Start Compute Payroll</h2>
<p style="margin-left: 8px;">This release corrects a Compute PR Fringe Allocation-to-JCH Rounding Issue. The Certified PR Report (RPRCRPR.rpt) dated 2/21/14 has been modified to better support fringe calculations. &#160;</p>
<h3>10.9.1 GL Interface for Accrued Vacation Pay</h3>
<p>The option to compute accrued vacation as a percentage of wages was implemented version 7.3. the Employee Paid Time Off tab is used to define the applicable Pay Types/Percent to be accrued. This release extends that work to include a registry-enabled GL interface for accrued pay (typically Vacation in Canada). See user note 2.27.1 for the registry entry needed to enable this feature.</p>
<h2>10.10 Report PR W-2s</h2>
<p>This release corrects the setting of the Third Party Sick Pay field.</p>
<h3>10.10.1 Box 12 Code P Support for Moving Expenses</h3>
<p>This release supports the use of W2 Box 12 code P for Excludable moving expense reimbursements paid directly to the employee. To implement, you must first set up an Other Rate as discussed below.</p>
<p><font style="font-weight: bold;">Other Rate Viewer:</font></p>
<p style="margin-left: 36.00pt;">Create a new Other Rate Id for REIMB-MOVE (in Desc put in Moving Expense Reimbursement) and setup a GL Debit to what GL Acct you want to charge. GL Credit is to the Accrued PR account.</p>
<p style="margin-left: 36.00pt;">Do not set any dollar amounts in rate/cost, set the billing rate type as N/A</p>
<p style="margin-left: 36.00pt;"><font style="font-weight: bold;">Other Rate User 2:<br /></font>This field must be set to 12:P to implement this functionality.</p>
<p><font style="font-weight: bold;">Recording the Moving Expense:</font></p>
<p><font style="text-decoration: underline;">If the employee has not yet been reimbursed for the moving expenses</font>, enter the expense on the Labor Journal Other tab. When the check is cut, the reimbursement will be recorded in PR History and will appear on the employee’s W2 based on the 12:P code in the Other Rate User 2 field.</p>
<p><font style="text-decoration: underline;">If the employee has already been reimbursed for these expenses</font>, you will need to create a PR Adjustment (in the PR Journal) to enter this information into PR History. Create a PR Journal entry referencing the Other Rate Id on the PR Journal’s Other Tab for the Amount reimbursed. You will also have to specify the Total Other in the PR Journal header. When the PR Journal is saved, the reimbursement will be recorded in PR History and will appear on the employee’s W2 based on the 12:P code in the Other Rate User 2 field.</p>
<h3>10.10.2 Box 12 Code DD Support for Employer Sponsored Health Coverage</h3>
<p>This reporting requirement was introduced by the 2010 Affordable Care Act. The idea is that reporting the cost of healthcare will enable employees to be better informed about their healthcare costs and the choices available to them. <font style="font-weight: bold;">For 2012 the reporting is required for employers filing more than 250 W-2s.</font> The 250 limit may be reduced in the future but for the moment small employers are not required to report the cost of healthcare coverage.</p>
<p>SAMPro can already handle this by treating the Employer Sponsored Health Coverage as a non-taxable fringe and using the PR Adjustments Journal to record the dollar amounts that are appropriate for each employee.</p>
<p style="margin-left: 36.00pt;">1. The user should first create the appropriate Earnings record for this fringe, and enter 12:DD into the W-2 Category field.</p>
<p style="margin-left: 36.00pt;">2. Next, the applicable PR Adjustment entry should be made for each employee.&#160;&#160;The GL transactions would already have been made, the PR Adjustment entry gets it on the W-2.&#160;&#160;</p>
<h2>10.11 ADP Export</h2>
<p>The Other Rate User1 field can now be used to classify reimbursables for ADP by entering a 1-2 character code appropriate for ADP. When a code is specified this field, it will override the DefaultReimbCode registry entry, allowing for multiple codes to be used.</p>
<h3>10.11.1 &#160;ADP PRS Code Enhancements and Export Registry</h3>
<h5>PRS Code Support for ADP</h5>
<p>This release supports the use of the PRS Code fields in the Pay Type and Other Rate records for the &#160;ADP Export. Note that if your system is already set up with the ADP Codes in the User 1 fields it is not necessary to complete the PRS fields. IMPORTANT: TechAnywhere also uses the PRS Codes/User 1: do NOT change your setup with consulting your TechAnywhere and SAMPro support reps.</p>
<p style="text-decoration: underline;">Pay Type Hierarchy for ADP Codes:</p>
<p style="margin-left: 48px;">Pay Type PRS Pay Code (overrides User 1 and Id)<br />
Pay Type User 1 (overrides Id)<br />
Pay Type Id</p>
<p style="margin-left: 8px; text-decoration: underline;">Other Rate Hierarchy for ADP Codes:</p>
<p style="margin-left: 48px;">Other Rate PRS Reimb Code (overrides User 1 and registry)<br />
Other Rate User 1 (overrides registry)<br />
Registry Entry (sys-adp-export DefaultReimbCode option in sys-adp-export)</p>
<h5>Export Registry for ADP</h5>
<p>This modification was developed for specific customers and should NOT be used without first discussing with your SAMPro support rep. &#160;Requires the user to review all Pay Types for Regular and Overtime (hours worked) and change the Hours type for 'Other' to 'Worked' and change the category from 'Other' to 'Regular' or 'Overtime'. After editing these Pay Types, this registry option is added so the ADP export will continue to extract Regular and OT Hours as Hours 3 Amount (prints as Other Hours on the report) but allows the Labor Journal to dispaly the correct Recap totals by Category / Hours Type.</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: bold;">Registry Id:</span> sys-adp-export:</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: bold;">Setting Key:</span> ReclassifyRegOTHours &#160;&#160;&#160;<span style="font-weight: bold;">Setting Value:</span> true &#160;(default is false)</p>
<p>Enabling this registry entry will cause Regular and Overtime hours worked to be reclassified in the .cvs export file as Hours 3 Amount (Other Hours on the report).</p>
<p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">&#160;</p>
<h2>10.12 CPP Time Import</h2>
<p>The Selection list now uses the correct job cost category.</p>
<p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">&#160;</p>
<h2>10.13 TimeAnywhere</h2>
<p>If any part of a TimeAnywhere message fails posting, all entries are rolled back.</p>
<p>The Job Cost Category Id from the TimeAnywhere message is used when creating the labor entry. This Job Cost Category overrides any defaults that may get set from a labor rate.</p>
<p style="margin-left: 36.00pt;">&#160;</p>
<h2>10.14 Tax Authority</h2>
<p>Corrects a spurious "asUpperCase Not Understood" error when the All State box (in Allowances for Other Deductions) is checked.</p>
<h1>11 QuoteMaster</h1>
<h2>11.1 Quote Master Approval Wizard</h2>
<p style="margin-left: 8px;">The 'WARNING: this work order has open assignments to remote technicians" message is disabled when the Approval Wizard is run to ensure that the post will run correctly.</p>
<p>Corrects a sporadic 'key is missing' error while running the Quote Approval Wizard.</p>
<p>The following sys-viewer-vqte registry option is once again supported:</p>
<p style="margin-left: 36.00pt;">Setting Key: locationid Setting Value: defaultlocationid</p>
<p style="margin-left: 36.00pt;">With the Setting Value blank, this option forces a blank location in the Approval Wizard, which the user must then complete. Note that the Location Id in the wizard is only used when generating a new work order - if you write to the lead work order, its location id is not changed or blanked.</p>
<p><font style="font-weight: bold;">PO’s Generated from Quotes:</font></p>
<p style="margin-left: 36.00pt;">Purchase Orders created via the Approval Wizard now reference the appropriate Client Site Equipment Id's from the Scope line used to generate the purchase detail. If identical Inventory, Material or Subcontractor lines exist on multiple Quote Options and are consolidated on the PO, the last Equipment line referenced in the process will appear on the consolidated PO detail line(s).</p>
<p style="margin-left: 36.00pt;">The system now compares the net Job History postings from the PO’s Inventory, General and Sub tabs to the Total and Committed Cost values derived from the tabs themselves. A TabHistoryMismatch' alert appears and the PO is not saved if these tests fail.</p>
<p>This release corrects a problem with contingent alarms referencing ‘quote approved’ as the From status being executed when the work order never achieved quote approved status. Also corrects issue where a work order log entry was not always generated when a new work order was created from Quote Master.</p>
<p>The work order registry option DenyChangesToQuoteMasterLines prevented Quote Master from writing to work orders in recent releases. This problem has been corrected.</p>
<p>In this release, the approval wizard sums the Subcontractor lines so that only one line for each Subcontractor will be written to the work order’s Tech tab, and the quote will post successfully.</p>
<p>The sys-viewer-vqte option ApprovalWizardDefaultTechStatus is used to set the default status in the Approval Wizard's Technician pane. In recent releases, this option worked correctly UNLESS the technician was a subcontractor. In this release, the software has been corrected so that the ApprovalWizardDefaultTechStatus is also used for subcontractor technicians.</p>
<h2>11.2 Quote Viewer</h2>
<p>Previously, when a quote was cloned by entering 'new' in the Quote Id field, the last line of the Labor and Other tabs was copied to the first line of its tab. Now all lines are copied properly.</p>
<p>This release corrects a sporadic failure to generate a PO if, on the Subcontractor tab, the same Other Rate Id is referenced multiple times with a manual change to the Description field.</p>
<p>This release corrects a sporadic row lock issue.</p>
<p>Corrects rounding issues on revenues resulting in Tab Mismatch errors.</p>
<p>This release corrects Tab Mismatch errors on the Quantity fields of the Material and Other tabs.</p>
<p>SAMPro now supports Flat Rate quantities other than whole numbers to prevent a conflict with TechAnywhere. This release also corrects a problem where importing a Fixed Fee Flat Rate also calculated the revenues on the detail lines.&#160;</p>
<p>Corrects a Tab Mismatch error due to the extended value of negative quantity detail lines being off by a penny. Validation has also been added to prevent the Vendor Id from being completed on negative quantity Inventory and Material lines when the Quote is saved/added.</p>
<p>This release corrects a spurious Tab Mismatch Revenue Adjustment error that occurred when a Flat Rate was imported.</p>
<p>Corrects TabMismatch alerts due to rounding errors on costs with 3 decimal places on multiple lines, and when Revenue Adjustments were added on saving the quote.</p>
<p>Corrects spurious ‘Option Code does not exist in Scope Lines’ error that occurred in recent images when editing/adding detail lines if the Option Code included uppercase letters.</p>
<p>The Scope Option field is now a required field on all detail lines.</p>
<h3>11.2.1 New Tab: Gross Margin</h3>
<p>This release eliminates the spurious 'Required Field: Cost Cat: Not Filled In' messages that could appear when filtering by option code.</p>
<p><img src="image/SKIN1_RefreshGM.gif" alt="image\SKIN1_RefreshGM.gif" title="image\SKIN1_RefreshGM.gif" width="88" height="28" border="0" /></p>
<p>Click this button to update the Gross margin Tab with data entered on the Quote since it was last saved.</p>
<p><font style="font-weight: bold;">Filter By Option Code:<br /></font>If this filter is blank, this tab will summarize all scopes entered on this quote; the quote must be saved to correctly display current information.</p>
<p>To display the gross margin for a single option, enter the option code and press Enter. The display will be filtered to that option only.</p>
<p><font style="font-weight: bold;">Totals:</font></p>
<p style="margin-left: 36.00pt;"><font style="font-weight: bold;">Total Cost: Total Revenue: GM % GM$:<br /></font><font style="font-weight: bold;">Labor: Material: Other: Subcontract: Total:</font></p>
<p>These display-only fields are computed by the system based on the values entered in the scope and other detail lines of this quote. Note that that revenue adjustment amounts are assigned to a category (Labor, Material, Other or Subcontract) based on their Cost Category. Click off of this tab and then back onto it to view the results of current edits to the quote.</p>
<h3>11.2.2 Scope Tab</h3>
<p>This release corrects a problem where clearing the Fixed Price field (by entering a zero) on the second or greater Scope line would instead clear the Fixed Price AND Cost Category in the first Scope line.</p>
<p>The Scope of Services field has been expanded from 1024 to 3000 characters.</p>
<h3>11.2.3 Inventory Tab</h3>
<p>When adding inventory items, the Job Cost Category now defaults from the Inventory Group unless it has already been entered manually by the user.</p>
<h3>11.2.4 Main Tab</h3>
<p><img src="image/PrintChangeOrder.gif" alt="image\PrintChangeOrder.gif" title="image\PrintChangeOrder.gif" width="88" height="28" border="0" /></p>
<p>A new button, Print Change Order, has been added to the Quote viewer. This feature is intended to be used for change order management with construction-type jobs. When clicked, this button will automatically call the new Report Change Order report RCOv73b016.rpt – note that this report MUST be installed for this functionality to work. The Create CO button on the Quote’s Option lines may be used to create the Change Order itself.</p>
<p style="margin-left: 36.00pt;"><font style="font-weight: bold;">Tip:</font> When the Change Order is approved by the customer, the Quotemaster Approval Wizard’s Create Job Budget Option may be used to generate Job Budget Tab entries the Change Order. Alternately, the standard Export to Work Order option may be used to manage the work in the field.</p>
<p><font style="font-weight: bold;">New Report: Report Change Order (RCOv73b016.rpt)</font></p>
<p>This report is designed to be run from the Quote viewer to produce a Change Order document for construction type jobs. It closely resembles the standard quote form, but labeled as “Change Order” instead of Quote. Most users will be able to use their ‘header’ or ‘general’ bitmap with this report.</p>
<h3>11.2.5 Revenue Adjustments</h3>
<p><font style="font-weight: bold;">Change Field: GL Entity<br /></font>This field defaults from the Default Service Job Cost Code of the Equipment referenced on the selected Option.</p>
<h3>11.2.6 Handling of Option Codes with Uppercase Text</h3>
<p>This release corrects a problem encountered if the Scope's Option Code included uppercase text, but the detail tabs referencing it Option Code used lowercase text. This could result in the non-Fixed Price totals displayed on Scope tab not correctly reflecting the detail amounts or the printed quote. In this release, text Option Codes are handled correctly in new quotes, regardless of whether they are entered in upper or lower case.</p>
<p><font style="font-weight: bold; font-style: italic;">For existing (but not fully approved) Quotes, click the Revenue Adjust button to synchronize the Scope Option revenues for non-Fixed Price quotes with the revenue amounts on the detail tabs.</font></p>
<p><font style="font-weight: bold;">Quote Master Wizard:</font></p>
<p>All Option Codes listed on the Wizard are now displayed in lower-case text.</p>
<p><font style="font-weight: bold;">Quote Master Option Code Selector</font></p>
<p>When you double-click on the Option Code on one of the detail tabs (Labor, Inventory, etc.), all Option Codes will be displayed in lower-case text.</p>
<p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">&#160;</p>
<h1>12 Service Management</h1>
<h2>12.1 Work Order Viewer</h2>
<p>Corrects checking of serialized items so the WO can be set to Invoice Ready when all items are fully received and the registry option OkToBillWithOpenPOs is set to false.</p>
<p>This release corrects spurious Revenue Adjustments Tab Mismatch errors that could occur if a previously invoiced Time of Service Billed PM Work Order was posted to by Quotemaster. This fix prevents PM Work Orders from getting in this state in the future.</p>
<p>Validation requires a Job when importing a Flat Rate. If the Work Order header Job is blank when the Import Flat Rate button is clicked, &#160;the system will display a warning and not allow the import.</p>
<p>This release <font style="font-weight: bold;">c</font>orrects a sporadic problem where the Closing Call Script Loaded flag not always set when the Closing Call Script was run.</p>
<p>This release corrects a sporadic System Primitive Error when the user changed an Equipment Id on the Equipment tab and added a new Equipment line during the same Save operation. This error only occurred if blank Metric lines existed for the lines being changed / added.</p>
<p>Corrects spurious Revenue Adjustment Tab Mismatch errors.</p>
<p>Corrects a sporadic error in version 8.0.510.020 when the system was unable to determine the Date Work Completed. This release also denies saving the work order if NO technician lines exist.</p>
<p>The Work Performed and Work Requested fields on the Work Order Main, Invoicing and Equipment tabs have all been expanded from 1200 to 3000 characters.</p>
<p>The Work Order Closing Call Script and Service Recommendation functions have been reinstated, correcting a problem in earlier versions.</p>
<p>This release corrects a performance issue launching the Scheduled Event viewer from Work Order viewer’s Scheduled Event button.</p>
<p>If you double click on one of the lines on the Escalation parent tab, the applicable Scheduled Event record is now opened.</p>
<h3>12.1.1 Invoicing Tab</h3>
<p><font style="font-weight: bold;">Changed Field: Date Work Completed</font><br />
If the global registry option DateWorkCompletedToday was set to true, the Date Work Completed was always set to today then the work order was ‘completed’. In this release, it is only set to Today if it is blank. If this registry is not enabled, the Date Work Completed will always be derived from the most recent date on the Technicians tab when it is considered completed.</p>
<p>Note that a Work Order is considered ‘completed’ if:</p>
<p style="margin-left: 36.00pt;">At least one Tech line is set to 'completed', 'wait paperwork', 'invoice ready' or 'invoicedisputed')</p>
<p style="margin-left: 36.00pt;">AND</p>
<p style="margin-left: 36.00pt;">The WO Escalation Status Category is to 'completed' or 'pending ok to invoice')</p>
<p>A registry option may be used to allow the Service Billing Worksheet to be run when WO is not Invoice Ready. See customer release note 2.26.</p>
<p>The sys-viewer-vwrkordr registry option (OkToBillWithOpenPOs=false) denies setting of the Ok to Invoice flag if a work order is associated with open (not fully received) PO's.&#160;&#160;In recent releases this functionality was not working: it has been restored in this release.</p>
<p>This release corrects a spurious ‘Client is not a Template’ error that occurred when the user attempted to clear the Override Client field.</p>
<h3>12.1.2 Other Tab</h3>
<p>This update concerns users recently upgraded from v7.1 or earlier. When the date on Other tab entries originally entered in an earlier version was changed, and then the work order was invoiced, the date for this invoice detail did not match the new date on the Other tab. This has been corrected.</p>
<h3>12.1.3 Work Order List</h3>
<p>The Work Order Original Id has been added as the right-most column of the WorkOrdersByIdByClientSiteName sort order.</p>
<h3>12.1.4 Technicians Tab</h3>
<p>When a WO is set to Invoice Ready, the history transaction date and time are written to the Status Date and Status Time (Magnify button) for WO Tech lines updated by this change</p>
<p>When a WO is saved with a WO Tech status change, the history transaction date and time are written to the Status Date and Status Time fields of the WO Tech line.</p>
<p><font style="font-weight: bold;">New Button: TechFinder<br /></font>A TechFinder button has been added to the Technicians tab. When clicked, the TechFinder opens, with the work order's Zone and the Certification for the first piece of equipment on the Equipment tab passed to the TechFinder filters. When the user completes the TechFinder processing, the system returns the selected Technician Id, Date and Time to the Technician line.</p>
<h3>12.1.5 Metrics Tab</h3>
<p>This tab now supports CC (Cycle Code filtering) – see user note 12.5 for details.</p>
<p>The Metrics tab is now correctly updated when equipment is added, inserted or deleted from the Equipment tab, as well as when the Equipment Id is changed.</p>
<p style="margin-left: 36.00pt;"><font style="font-weight: bold;">Note:</font> If an Equipment Id associated with Metrics is deleted, only those lines on the Metrics tab that have been recorded (a date and/or value has been entered) will be retained. If the same Equipment Id is re-entered, the system does not restore blank Metrics lines that were not recorded. You must click the Sync Metrics button to do so.</p>
<p><font style="font-weight: bold;">New Button: Sync Metrics<br /></font>This new button will import missing metrics (e.g, if work order was assigned to a remote tech, then reassigned to a tech with web-access = none) and tidy-up orphaned lines (if going from a non-remote tech to a remote tech). Cycle Code filtering is based on the Work Code on the Equipment tab (if present) or the Work Code in the Work Order header if the Equipment tab’s Work Code is not completed.</p>
<p style="margin-left: 36.00pt;">Note that if you add a piece of Equipment, it's log form defaults from the Equipment record, not the override the user may have selected for this Work Order in New Call.</p>
<h3>12.1.6 Gross Margin Tab</h3>
<p>In this release, Revenue Adjustment 'Apply Prepaid' lines are ignored when making the Gross Revenue calculations.</p>
<p>The Revenue Adjustment button now correctly evaluates the Add/Deduct flag in the Revenue Adjustment records. Previously, it always defaulted to Add.&#160;</p>
<h3>12.1.7 Log Tab</h3>
<p><font style="font-weight: bold;">New Fields</font> (must click Magnify button to view):<br />
<font style="font-weight: bold;">Latitude:<br />
Longitude</font><font style="font-weight: bold;">:</font>&#160;&#160;<br />
These display only fields will be set when a status change is uploaded from TechAnywhere. Their values are determined by the geo-location of the technician when they change the status of the work order.</p>
<p><font style="font-weight: bold;">New Button: Map It</font><font style="font-weight: bold;"><br /></font>If the Latitude and Longitude fields are completed, clicking Map It will open Google Maps to display the location.</p>
<h3>12.1.18 Inventory Tab</h3>
<p>This release changes the behavior when posting WO-INV entries to GL History.&#160;&#160;Previously, the GLH Credit never included a GL Entity.&#160;&#160;In this release, the system ALWAYS uses the GL Entity from the WO-INV line's Location record. Set the GL Entity in the Location record to ensure that the Credit GL Entity defaults properly when items are entered on the Work Order Inventory tab.</p>
<h3>12.1.18a Serialized Inventory Handling</h3>
<p>In previous releases, the user was prevented from adding a serialized item to a work order in the following circumstance:</p>
<p>1. Sell/use a specific serialized item on work order A.</p>
<p>2. Make an Inventory Adjustments entry to transfer it from the WO/Job back into a stocking location.</p>
<p>3. When user attempted to resell the item on work order B, the message “The Serialized Inventory Item has been used in WorkOrder (A) would appear when the serial number was entered.</p>
<p>In this release, the Work Order Inventory validation has been improved so that a serialized item that has been returned to stock from a work order it may be successfully added to a different work order from its stocking location.</p>
<p style="margin-left: 36.00pt;"><font style="font-weight: bold;">Note:</font> <font style="font-weight: bold;">Managing Serialized Items</font></p>
<p style="margin-left: 36.00pt;">If a serialized item was charged to A by mistake, the process should be to remove it from Work Order A.&#160;&#160;That puts it back into stock and there is no need for the IM Adjustment entry.<br />
<br />
If the part was 'used' on A (e.g., rental equipment) and is going back into stock so it can later be used on B, it should still appear on A as far as being a chargeable cost with/without associated revenue.&#160;&#160;In this case, returning it stock would be done with the Inventory Adjustments Journal.</p>
<p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">&#160;</p>
<h3>12.1.19 Work Order Escalation Tab</h3>
<p><font style="font-weight: bold;">Removed Columns: Date and Time</font><font style="font-weight: bold;">:<br /></font>The Date and Time column displayed the Scheduled Date and Time fields of the Event. However, these fields were not set if the event was executed immediately (such as when the system plays ‘catch up’ when a new tech is added to the work order, and escalations that had been sent to the first tech are repeated to the new tech). This made customers question whether the escalation has 'really' executed, resulting in repeated requests for more information from our support staff.</p>
<p><font style="font-weight: bold;">New Columns:</font></p>
<p><font style="font-weight: bold;">Scheduled:<br /></font>This column lists the scheduled date and time of the event determined by the escalation manager.</p>
<p>If the Status field is set to Executed and Scheduled Column is set to 1900-01-01 00:00:00, the event was executed immediately (such as when the system plays ‘catch up’ when a new tech is added to the work order, and escalations that had been sent to the first tech are repeated to the new tech). The new Created column lists the date and time the event was created and executed.</p>
<p><font style="font-weight: bold;">Created:<br /></font>This column lists date and time the scheduled event was created. It also provides the execution date for events that were executed immediately upon creation.</p>
<h3>12.1.20 Work Order Cost Import Wizard</h3>
<p>The Import Costs Wizard no longer sets the Quantity Billable for inventory imported from Purchase Orders generated by Quotes using a T&amp;M Billing Item (not recommended) to prevent double-billing.</p>
<p>In this release, the Import Wizard now allows the successful import of lines with billable but no actual hours from the Labor Journal/TechAnywhere.</p>
<p>Corrects an 'Argument must be a collection'&#160;error that occurred if a user with global security launched the WO Import Costs Wizard.&#160;</p>
<h3>12.1.21 Work Order Revenue Tab</h3>
<p>Improved handling of the Billed field.</p>
<h3>12.1.22 Work Order Invoices Tab</h3>
<p>The Invoice Description, Balance and Last Payment Date have been added to this tab.</p>
<h3>12.1.23 Required Resource Tab</h3>
<p><font style="font-weight: bold;">Import Required Resources – CHANGE TO DEFAULT BEHAVIOR</font></p>
<p>In previous releases, the Import RR button on the Work Order viewer allowed a user to point to a .csv file which specified the quantities/inventory items to be added to the Required Resources tab. This enhancement enables both inventory and non-inventory materials to be imported to the Required Resources tab. <font style="font-weight: bold;">A change to the import file specifications is required:</font></p>
<p>New file specs:&#160;</p>
<p>&#160;Field1 = Quantity to requisition</p>
<p>&#160;Field2 = Inventory Item ID</p>
<p>&#160;Field3 = Description (Only required for non-inventory items)</p>
<p>&#160;Field4 = Vendor ID (Can be used for inventory and non-inventory items)</p>
<p>&#160;Field5 = Y/N (This Flag Must be Y for inventory or N for non-inventory items)&#160;</p>
<p>Note that a header line is <font style="text-decoration: underline;">not</font> required; only data lines should appear in the file.</p>
<p>If the item is marked as Inventory (inventory flag=Y) then only the Quantity, Inventory Item Id and Vendor Id vendor id data is looked at. If the item is marked as Non-Inventory (inventory flag=N) then do not perform any validation unless a vendor id is supplied.</p>
<p>The wizard will validate that:</p>
<p style="margin-left: 36.00pt;">Inventory item exists in the Sampro database.</p>
<p style="margin-left: 36.00pt;">The Vendor exists in the Sampro database</p>
<h3>12.1.24 Construction Type Jobs on Work Orders - CHANGE TO DEFAULT BEHAVIOR</h3>
<p>Some clients use work orders for certain portions of construction-type jobs to manage their technicians; typically, these work orders are not billable.&#160;In previous releases, the act of 'finishing' these work orders by setting them to Invoice Ready presented the user with an option to 'Compute the Invoice?' when the work order was saved.&#160;&#160;This is legacy code predating service compute-type jobs and billing. If the user answered Yes to the question, the system prepared the work order/job for billing by:</p>
<p style="margin-left: 36.00pt;">1. Creating a new Invoice Master record.<br />
2. Preparing all relevant JCH records for billing.<br />
3. Updating Billing Items.<br />
4. Setting Job's Invoice Status to 'Ready to Print'.</p>
<p>None of the above is necessary for most systems, and results in an orphaned Invoice Master record. In this release, the default behavior now eliminates the 'Compute the Invoice? question, since the billing for these construction jobs will be done from Record Billing Adjustments.</p>
<p>The following registry setting is available to restore the old behavior; this is not recommended unless the user is still using the old-style service invoicing and actually needs to be able to compute the invoice from the work order.&#160;</p>
<p><font style="font-weight: bold;">Id:</font> sys-viewer-vwrkordr</p>
<p><font style="font-weight: bold;">Setting Key:</font> ComputeInvoiceForConstructionJobs&#160;&#160;Setting Value: true</p>
<h3>12.1.25 Purchases Tab</h3>
<p>For Credit PO's, the Purchase tab now shows zero if the item has not been received, or the applicable negative number if it has been received. Previously, all Credit PO’s displayed as received.</p>
<p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">&#160;</p>
<h2>12.2 Create PM Billings</h2>
<p>Previously, if the global registry options DefaultGLAccountPMBilledInAdvance and DefaultGLAccountPMIncome were enabled, earnings-only lines were not processed if GL Accounts were omitted from the Client Site PM Billing tab. This problem has be corrected so that accrual-only lines are correctly processed. &#160;</p>
<p>If the Job’s Tax Status is set to Unknown, it will be excluded from the list of eligible billings and instead be included in the workspace list of failed jobs.</p>
<h2>12.3 Dispatch Board</h2>
<p>Corrects a problem in recent versions where the user could not always scroll to the extreme right-hand cells of the Classic board, or the bottom cells of the Day board.</p>
<p>This release corrects a sporadic “[ODBC SQL Server Driver] Connection is busy with results for another hstmt” error encountered by some users.</p>
<p>Corrects a sporadic problem in the Classic Board where changing the selected Tech List resulted in only Unassigned WOs appearing. In addition, it is no longer necessary to click the Classic tab to return to the Classic board; the system will display the Classic board if it was displayed prior to selecting the Tech List tab.</p>
<p>Corrects issue in 8.0.510.016 where status changes could not be saved from the Classic Board.</p>
<p>The Service Category Id has been added as a range field to the Filter Calls tab.</p>
<p>Previously, the Description field on Work Order List defaulted from the Work Order Name. In this version, if the Name is blank, the first 40 characters of the Work Order Work Requested will be displayed in the Description instead. A registry setting allows the Work Requested to be displayed first, and the Name to be displayed if the Work Requested is blank: see user note 2.8.2.</p>
<p>This release extends the Unavailable Technician functionality to the Classic Board when the Change Orientation button is clicked. Unavailable Techs will now have their row header displayed with a red background.</p>
<h3>12.3.1 Notes Button</h3>
<p>Clicking the Notes button on the D-Board left-hand tool bar displays box a Notes Option box to allow the user to view/add Client Site, Job or WO notes for the selected work order. In previous releases, this button did not distinguish whether or not the selected line had any existing Notes. In this release, the system evaluates the selected line:</p>
<p><img src="image/SKIN1_NotesOn.gif" alt="image\SKIN1_NotesOn.gif" title="image\SKIN1_NotesOn.gif" width="94" height="28" border="0" /> or <img src="image/NOTESON.gif" alt="image\NOTESON.gif" title="image\NOTESON.gif" width="48" height="28" border="0" /> If Notes are attached to the Work Order, Site or Job, the Notes On button will be displayed.</p>
<p><img src="image/SKIN1_Notes.gif" alt="image\SKIN1_Notes.gif" title="image\SKIN1_Notes.gif" width="94" height="28" border="0" /> or <img src="image/NOTES.gif" alt="image\NOTES.gif" title="image\NOTES.gif" width="48" height="28" border="0" /> If the selected Line does not have Notes, the blank Notes button appears – clicking it allows the user to add notes.</p>
<p><img src="image/SKIN1_Notes-.gif" alt="image\SKIN1_Notes-.gif" title="image\SKIN1_Notes-.gif" width="94" height="28" border="0" /> or <img src="image/NOTES-.gif" alt="image\NOTES-.gif" title="image\NOTES-.gif" width="48" height="28" border="0" /> If a Work Order is not selected, the grayed out Notes button is displayed.</p>
<h3>12.3.2 Unavailable Tech</h3>
<p>This enhancement adds an Unavailable Tech warning to the following Dispatch Board functions if the change would result in an Unavailable Technician getting the work order:</p>
<p style="margin-left: 36.00pt;">1) Change Tech Tab<br />
2) Sidebar Button - Set Today button<br />
3) Classic Board: changing the WO Summary Pane<br />
4) Classic Board: Dragging the WO to an Unavailable Tech</p>
<p>The warning that appears clarifies the meaning of the Yes and No buttons:</p>
<p style="margin-left: 36.00pt;">Press 'Yes' acknowledge this warning without assigning this WorkOrder to an unavailable Technician.<br />
<br />
Press 'No' to ignore this warning and assign this WorkOrder to an unavailable Technician.</p>
<h3>12.3.3 Classic Board:</h3>
<p>The Directions to Site field has been returned to the Work Order Summary (lower section) of the Classic Board. If you are currently running Version 8.0, a revised v.cus file is required to see the change.</p>
<p>The Estimated Hours field is now an editable field on the Dispatch Summary (lower half) of the Classic board. This enhancement is implemented for WinII customization users and for users with a customization based on WinII (e.g, CA).</p>
<p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">&#160;</p>
<h2>12.4 New Call</h2>
<p>This release corrects a minor display issue when accessing the New Site (flashlight) screen with the Master Contract pane enabled.</p>
<p>In previous releases, if a Client was on Credit Hold, the first work order created in New Call was put on Credit Hold. However, if additional work orders were generated by simply choosing another site for same Client (without entering new Search Text), they were NOT placed on Credit Hold. These subsequent Work Orders are now correctly put on Credit Hold.</p>
<p>When a Web Log with the Equipment Id set in TechAnywhere is processed in New Call, it does not automatically select the Equipment (although the Site will still be selected).</p>
<p>Selecting a Work Code no longer resets the Job Id back to the Equipment’s default Job.</p>
<p>The Work Order User 1 Field in New Call supports the double click Custom Field functionality.</p>
<p>If the Service Category field is completed, double-clicking the Work Code field once again displays the list that is automatically filtered to those active work codes referencing that service category.</p>
<p>Credit Hold processing (the Site / Client is set to Credit Hold, or the Client’s AR Days are exceeded) is once again supported; this was a problem in recent versions.</p>
<p>When only the Site is selected and Jobs with multiple Clients are found in the Equipment list, the following improved message appears when the Collection button is pressed: "Equipment for the Site references multiple clients. Please select Equipment and try again."</p>
<p>The system uses the Client from the selected Default Job for the Collections Button functionality.</p>
<p>This release corrects a problem where the Client Id was not set the second time a Site was searched for.</p>
<p>See user release note 12.13 for a registry entry to auto-generate web logs into work orders.</p>
<h3>12.4.1 New Call New Client (Flashlight) Screen</h3>
<p><img src="image/SKIN1_CallScriptActive.gif" alt="image\SKIN1_CallScriptActive.gif" title="image\SKIN1_CallScriptActive.gif" width="94" height="28" border="0" /> The Call Script button has been added to the New Site (Flashlight) sidebar. If a Call Script was initiated as a result of selecting a Work Code, clicking this button allows the user to review the Call Script questions and answers before generating the work order.</p>
<p>This release corrects a Truncation error when the system attempted to write too many characters to the Job Alpha field from this screen. This only appeared in SQL Server.</p>
<p>Two new fields, Log Form Id: (used for system metrics) and Escalation Profile Id: have been added to the Equipment section of this screen so that the user can specify them when creating new equipment and generating a work order.</p>
<p style="margin-left: 36.00pt;"><font style="font-weight: bold;">Important Note on Metrics:</font> when a work order referencing a log form is created in SAMPro, metrics will only be written to the work order metrics tab if the Technician is not a TechAnywhere tech (e.g., Remote Access is set to None) or no Tech is specified. If the work order initially assigned to a technician with remote access, metrics will be uploaded to the technician’s device, and then posted to the work order in SAMPro when they have been completed in the field.</p>
<h3>12.4.2 New Call (Original Screen)</h3>
<p>Corrects a problem where the Original Caller was blanked when a Site with Notes was auto-selected by entering search text. Note that this problem only occurred if the auto-select occurred on the second (or subsequent) entry of the search text.</p>
<p>Corrects a problem with Service Channel special processing introduced in a recent image.</p>
<p>Corrects stack overflow if you selected a&#160;web log which referenced a site with a single piece of equipment.</p>
<p>The Default Service Job from the Equipment record now loads correctly when the search text results in a single site with one piece of equipment being loaded.</p>
<p>Clicking the New WO button now clears all cached fields. The New button should be clicked before entering and tabbing out of the Search Text field if you wish to search again for the same text (for example, when switching from New Call to New Call 2). The New button should also be clicked to clear all fields if you select a Web Log but do not use it to create a new work order.</p>
<p>The Attachments button in New Call lets you attach documents to one or more of the scheduled events generated by this work order and the work order itself; a registry setting defines the Document Category of files that are eligible for attachment.&#160;&#160;A checklist of files will appear in the upper portion of the screen – click in the Attach column to select /deselect a file.&#160;&#160;In previous releases, the grayed-out Attachments button was always displayed,&#160;even if Attachments were available. In this release:</p>
<p style="margin-left: 36.00pt;">If Attachments are available, the AttachmentsOn button is displayed.<br />
If no Attachments are available, the grayed-out Attachments- button is displayed.<br />
If user clicks the grayed-out button and no attachments are available, the message “No Documents are available for attachment to scheduled events for service work orders” is display and access to the attachments screen is denied:&#160;<br />
In the Attachments screen, the AttachmentsOn button takes you back to New Call.</p>
<p>Previously, if the user selected a Site, entered the Work Requested but did not tab out of the field, and then selected the Equipment, the Work Requested was blanked or overwritten by the text from the Work Code. In this release, the user-entered Work Requested is retained when Equipment is selected.</p>
<p>This release includes improvements to Service Category filtering when a single Site is auto-selected.</p>
<p>Addresses a problem where New Call messages popped twice if the Site was auto-selected from entering the Search Text.</p>
<p>Corrects error 8114 when right-clicking on the Web Log Id field.</p>
<p>When a user tabs out of the search text box in New Call 1, all fields except the Service Category are now cleared in preparation for selecting a new Site and Equipment..</p>
<p>The Log Form Id: field has been added to this screen. It defaults from the Equipment record, but may be changed by the user to select which log form id will be specified on the new work order.</p>
<h3>12.4.3 New Call Notes</h3>
<p>Corrects a non-continuable protection violation error that could sporadically occur when changing the Search For button from Alpha to Any.</p>
<p>In New Call, the Notes button allows the user to view/add notes for the selected Site. Previously, the icon used to indicate the Notes status was not displayed correctly. This has been corrected:</p>
<p><img src="image/SKIN1_NotesOn.gif" alt="image\SKIN1_NotesOn.gif" title="image\SKIN1_NotesOn.gif" width="94" height="28" border="0" /> or <img src="image/NOTESON.gif" alt="image\NOTESON.gif" title="image\NOTESON.gif" width="48" height="28" border="0" /> If the selected site has notes, the Notes On (notes with text) button appears.</p>
<p><img src="image/SKIN1_Notes.gif" alt="image\SKIN1_Notes.gif" title="image\SKIN1_Notes.gif" width="94" height="28" border="0" /> or <img src="image/NOTES.gif" alt="image\NOTES.gif" title="image\NOTES.gif" width="48" height="28" border="0" /> If the selected site has no existing notes, the Notes button appears (active notes with no text) so you can add notes to the site.</p>
<p><img src="image/SKIN1_Notes-.gif" alt="image\SKIN1_Notes-.gif" title="image\SKIN1_Notes-.gif" width="94" height="28" border="0" /> or <img src="image/NOTES-.gif" alt="image\NOTES-.gif" title="image\NOTES-.gif" width="48" height="28" border="0" /> Finally, if no Site is selected, the grayed out Notes button appears.</p>
<h3>12.4.4 New Field: Override Tech Status</h3>
<p>This field appears in New Call, New Call 2 and New Call Create (flashlight)</p>
<p><font style="font-weight: bold;">Note:</font> These changes pertain to the WinII customization and to customizations using the WinII New Call views. These changes may be added to custom New Call views.</p>
<p><font style="font-weight: bold;">Removed Fields:</font><br />
<font style="font-weight: bold;">Work Order Status radio buttons (Waiting Service, Travel, OnSite)</font></p>
<p>In previous releases, these fields were overridden by the sys-web-access registry entries. They have been replaced by the Override Tech Status field.</p>
<p><font style="font-weight: bold;">New Field:<br />
Override Tech Status:</font></p>
<p>By default, this field will be set to the value ‘ default’. If the user does not change it, the technician status will be set to the appropriate value for that type of technician (referring to the sys-web-access and other registry entries, if present). The ‘ ‘ blank Override Tech Status is processed in the same way as ‘ default’ if the user accidentally cleared the field.</p>
<p>If the user selects an Override Tech Status with the new field, the system will use that status on the tech line when the work order is created. Double-click in new field (or clicking the Magnify button) displays a quick pick list of valid statuses will appear with ' default' at the top. If another selection is made that selection will be used in setting the workorder tech workorder log type field.<br />
<br />
The pick list values can be controlled by implementing one of the following registry settings:</p>
<p><font style="font-weight: bold;">Id:</font> sys-newcall</p>
<p><font style="font-weight: bold;">Specify Statuses to Exclude</font></p>
<p><font style="font-weight: bold;">Setting Key:</font> LogStatusesRemoved <font style="font-weight: bold;">Setting Value:</font> <font style="font-style: italic;">status1,status2, ….</font></p>
<p>If this option is implemented, the Setting Value should define the list of statuses that should be excluded from the list.</p>
<p style="margin-left: 36.00pt;"><font style="text-decoration: underline;">Example:</font></p>
<p style="margin-left: 36.00pt;">Setting Key: LogStatusesRemoved Setting Value: archived,billed,completed</p>
<p><font style="font-weight: bold;">Specify Statuses to Include</font></p>
<p><font style="font-weight: bold;">Setting Key:</font> LogStatusesAllowed <font style="font-weight: bold;">Setting Value:</font> <font style="font-style: italic;">status1,status2, ….</font></p>
<p>If this option is implemented, the Setting Value should define the list of statuses that should be included on the list.</p>
<p><font style="font-weight: bold;">Disable the Override Tech Status</font> <font style="font-weight: bold;">Field</font></p>
<p>If the dispatcher should NEVER override the default status, the new Override Tech Status field can be disabled the following registry setting:</p>
<p><font style="font-weight: bold;">Id:</font> sys-start-snwcll</p>
<p><font style="font-weight: bold;">Setting Key:</font> DisabledFieldsParent <font style="font-weight: bold;">Setting Value:</font> wrkordrlgtype.id</p>
<h3>12.4.5 Other Lines Auto-generated from Client Site WO Other Tab</h3>
<p>When a work order is created, and an Other line is automatically generated from the Client Site's WO Other tab, the appropriate GL History entries will be generated if the Accounting Period’s WO Other to GL box is flagged.</p>
<p>To determine the correct Accounting Period, the system will look at the date to use on the WO Other line (either the date scheduled, or today's date if there is no scheduled date). If the date is with the default Accounting Period, it will use that. If the date is NOT within the default Accounting Period, it will find the appropriate active Accounting Period and use that.</p>
<h3>12.4.6 New Call Master Contract Pane</h3>
<p><img src="image/SKIN1_showMCP.gif" alt="image\SKIN1_showMCP.gif" title="image\SKIN1_showMCP.gif" width="94" height="28" border="0" /></p>
<p>This new sidebar button toggles the New Call display between the Client Site (middle) pane and the new Master Contract pane. A Client Site must be selected before clicking the button. The new Master Contract pane displays all Contracts associated with the selected Site. Contracts are listed in descending order of the Master Contract Date End. Doubling-clicking on a Contract list will open the Master Contract record.</p>
<p>Registry Entry to Automatically Display or Prompt User to See the Master Contract Pane</p>
<p style="margin-left: 36.00pt;">Id: sys-newcall<br />
Setting Key: ShowMasterContract Setting Value: prompt or automatic<br />
<br />
A Setting value of prompt means a Prompt will appear asking if you want to see the new Master Contract pane when a Site is selected.<br />
<br />
A Setting value of automatic means no Prompt will appear and the new Master Contract pane will automatically appear when a Site is selected.<br /></p>
<h2>12.5 Log Form Viewer (for Work Order Metrics)</h2>
<h3>12.5.1 Log Form Cycle Codes/Cycle Code Filtering Overview</h3>
<p>The Log Form specified on the Client Site Equipment record may include lines metrics that should be recorded at every service or maintenance call, as well as some that need only be recorded on (for example) system startup or installation. In this release, both SAMPro and TechAnywhere have been enhanced to filter (via the specified "Cycle Code Filter" associated with PM schedules and service Work Codes) the lines written to the Work Order Metrics tab. This enhancement allows the filtering of the metrics lines by Cycle Code.</p>
<p style="margin-left: 36.00pt;"><font style="font-weight: bold;">Important Note on Metrics</font><font style="font-weight: bold;">/Log Form Lines</font><font style="font-weight: bold;">:</font> when a work order referencing a log form is created in SAMPro, metrics (log form lines) will only be written to the Work Order Metrics tab if the Technician is not a TechAnywhere tech (e.g., Remote Access is set to None) or if no Tech is specified. If it is initially assigned to a technician with remote access, metrics will be uploaded to the technician’s device, and then posted to the work order in SAMPro when they have been completed in the field.</p>
<h3>12.5.2 Log Form Lines</h3>
<p><font style="font-weight: bold;">New Field: CC:</font><br />
This new Cycle Code field may be used to control which metrics are written to the Work Order Metrics tab when Service or PM Work Orders are generated. Note that Log Form field in the Client Site Equipment record determents which list of metrics is used.</p>
<p>When a Service Work Order is created in SAMPro’s New Call, the system will check the Cycle Code Filter in the Work Code; if this field is completed, only those log form line metrics whose CC: field corresponds to the filter or is blank will be written to the Work Order (for Techs without remote access) or uploaded to the Technician’s device.</p>
<p>When a PM Work Order is created, the system will check the Cycle Code Filter in the Client Site Equipment PM Schedule (or the Master Contract Schedule). If the Cycle Code Filter in the schedule is blank, the system will use the Cycle Code Filter in the Work Code instead. Only those metrics whose CC: field corresponds to the filter or is blank will be written to the Work Order (for Techs without remote access) or uploaded to the Technician’s device.</p>
<p style="margin-left: 36.00pt;"><font style="font-weight: bold;">Tip:</font> If a log form metric should ALWAYS be recorded, leave the CC field blank.</p>
<h3>12.5.3 Log Form Lines Error Handling</h3>
<p>Two rows in the same Log Form record may not contain identical Heading and Line contents. This viewer now displays the following error if you attempt to save the record with this situation: “LogFormLinesByDescriptionByParentRn for table ‘lgfrmlne’ would not be unique.” The user must edit the one of the offending row entries to insure its uniqueness before the record can be saved.</p>
<p>Example:</p>
<p style="margin-left: 36.00pt;">Not Allowed:</p>
<p style="margin-left: 36.00pt;">Row 1: Heading: Pressure Line: Test 1</p>
<p style="margin-left: 36.00pt;">Row 2: Heading: Pressure Line: Test 1</p>
<p style="margin-left: 36.00pt;">Allowed:</p>
<p style="margin-left: 36.00pt;">Row 1: Heading: Pressure Line: Test 1</p>
<p style="margin-left: 36.00pt;">Row 2: Heading: Pressure Line: Test 2</p>
<p>In addition, the user is warned if he or she changes the Line, Header or UM (Unit of Measure) of a that exists in work order system metrics:</p>
<p style="margin-left: 36.00pt;">"This field has been referenced in the work order metrics tab *** times. Any changes to this field should only be to correct typos or to clarify the test parameters - NOT to change the purpose of this metric."</p>
<p style="margin-left: 36.00pt;">&#160;</p>
<h2>12.6 Work Code Viewer</h2>
<p><font style="font-weight: bold;">New Field - Cycle Code Filter:</font><font style="font-weight: bold;"><br /></font>This filter is used by SAMPro and TechAnywhere to filter Work Order Log Form Metrics lists. Note that Log Form Id field in the Client Site Equipment record determines which list of metrics is used. Multiple cycle codes may be entered as a comma-delimited list. If this field is blank, all metrics from the Log Form will be written to the Metrics tab.</p>
<p>If one or more Cycle Codes are listed, only those Log Form (metrics) lines whose CC: field corresponds to the filter or is blank will be written to the Work Order (for Techs without remote access) or uploaded to the Technician’s device.</p>
<p>The Work Code in the Work Order header is used for metrics filtering purposes for Service Work Orders.</p>
<p>For PM Work Orders, the Cycle Code Filter (if completed) in the PM Schedule Tab of the Client Site Equipment, or the Schedule Tab of the Master Contract will override the Work Code’s Cycle Code Filter.</p>
<p style="margin-left: 36.00pt;"><font style="text-decoration: underline;">Example:</font> Cycle Code Filter: 1,3</p>
<p style="margin-left: 36.00pt;">Only those lines from the Log Form whose CC field is set to 1, to 3 or is blank would be written to the Work Order or uploaded to the Technician’s device.</p>
<h2>12.7 Master Contract</h2>
<p>Also see release note 12.17 for details on the new Time of Service Earned enhancement.</p>
<h3>12.7.1 Master Contract Schedule Tab</h3>
<p><font style="font-weight: bold;">New Field (click Magnify button to access) - Cycle Code Filter:</font></p>
<p>This filter is used by SAMPro and TechAnywhere to filter PM Work Order Log Form Metrics lists for the Equipment being maintained. Multiple cycle codes may be entered as a comma-delimited list. Note that Log Form field in the Client Site Equipment record determines which list of metrics is used.</p>
<p>If this field is blank, the system will use the Cycle Code in the Work Code instead for filtering. Only those metrics whose CC: field corresponds to the filter or is blank will be written to the Work Order (for Techs without remote access) or uploaded to the Technician’s device (for Technicians with remote access). If the Cycle Code filter in both the Schedule and Work Code are blank, all metrics from the Log Form will be written to the Metrics tab.</p>
<p>If one or more Cycle Codes are listed, only those metrics whose CC: field corresponds to this field or is blank will be written to the Work Order (for Techs without remote access) or uploaded to the Technician’s device.</p>
<h3>12.7.2 Start Renew Master Contracts</h3>
<p>Previously, running this function with Weighted and a zero percent increase selected could result in some of the new allocations being off by a few pennies. In this release, if an escalation percentage of 0 (zero) is selected, the Site’s amounts are not altered, only the dates.</p>
<h3>12.7.3 Site List Tab</h3>
<p>Corrects a display issue in recent releases. Deleting a line on the Site List tab no longer results in a 'ghost' line remaining, with the Job Tax Status set to Unknown but with all other fields blank.</p>
<h3>12.7.4 Master Contract / PM Schedule Table</h3>
<p>A new table has been implemented to simplify reporting/KPI’s of future PM inspections as defined in the Master Contracts.&#160;This table is maintained by the system, and is created during a database conversion to version 8.0 or above. Contents of the new table are affected by saving/adding Master Contracts and Site Equipment records with PM Schedules: a progress bar will appear briefly notifying the user of the update. The new table is also updated when generating PM Work Orders, as well as the Start Renew Service Contracts, Start Renew Master Contract and Create New PM Work Schedule from Old functions.</p>
<p>The new table is available in version 8.0 but must be activated for an existing 8.0 installation by making the following registry setting ...<br />
<br />
<font style="font-weight: bold;">&#160;&#160;Id:</font> sys-ffv-global-settings<br />
&#160;&#160;<font style="font-weight: bold;">Setting Key:</font> CreateMasterSiteEquipmentPMTable <font style="font-weight: bold;">Setting Value:</font> true<br />
<br />
When this new setting is detected, the SAMPro login process will check for the new table and create it when necessary.&#160;&#160;That is followed by the conversion process that populates the new table based on the contents of the Master Contract and Site Equipment PM Schedule records.&#160;</p>
<h3>12.7.4 New Function on Tools Menu to Rebuild Future Inspections Table</h3>
<p>The table named mstrcntrcteqpmntpm contains the data representing the 'future' inspection Master Contract schedule details where the Site Equipment PM lines have yet to be generated; this is used in KPI's and may be used for other reporting purposes. In the Master Contract viewer, the Tools&gt;Rebuild Inspections option may be used to re-sync the mstrcntrcteqpmntpm if it has incorrect entries. It is strongly recommended that this function be run after hours since it can take a significant amount of time to complete if you have many Master Contracts.</p>

<h2>12.8 Scheduled Events</h2>
<p>This enhancement alleviates a timing problem which might be encountered when restarting the Scheduled Event Manager by running Process events before sending emails.</p>
<p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">&#160;</p>
<h2>12.9 Tech Finder</h2>
<p>This release corrects a ‘trimtrailingblanks error’ that could occur when double-clicking on the Tech in the upper right-hand pane.</p>
<p>The technician unavailability enhancement was recently added to TechFinder: unavailable days are flagged as OFF.&#160;This release corrects an issue where multiple days (for example, all Saturdays in a particular month) for a single tech were not correctly indicated as OFF in Techfinder.&#160;</p>
<p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">&#160;</p>
<h2>12.10 Escalation Manager</h2>
<p>This release corrects a problem introduced in v8.0.510.032: if TechAnywhere Weblogs were created with an equipment record, their escalation events were not generated. Be sure to restart the Scheduled Event Manager (and other agent-type users) when installing this release so that this fix will be available.</p>
<p>This release corrects a timing problem in the Work Order viewer which escalated the work order before its Primary Tech was changed.&#160;&#160;This has been corrected so that both the tchncn_id and wrkordrtchncn_id tokens are evaluated correctly for the first technician on the tech tab.</p>
<h3>12.10.1 Cancelled Work Orders</h3>
<p>Canceling a work order now also cancels existing, non-tech based scheduled events: this prevents messages from continuing to execute for cancelled work orders. In this release, if the Work Order Escalation Status goes to Cancelled, applicable tech-based escalations are run (for example, one notifying the technician the WO was cancelled), and then existing (non-tech based) scheduled events are cancelled.</p>
<p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">&#160;</p>
<h2>12.11 Start Work Order Daily Edit</h2>
<p>This release includes performance enhancements for SageQuest users running this function.</p>
<p>A progress meter has been added when work orders are being updated.</p>
<h3>12.11.1 Range Screen</h3>
<p>This release corrects a problem where clicking the Search Id button in the New Status field dropped the selected Status into the Log Type Id range. In this release, the Search Id button impacts the New Status field, not the range.</p>
<p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">&#160;</p>
<h2>12.12 Technician Viewer</h2>
<h3>12.12.1 Technician Viewer Defaults Tab</h3>
<p><font style="font-weight: bold;">New Field: No Escalation?</font><font style="font-weight: bold;"><br /></font>Flagging this field stops future "Tech Based" escalation events from being generated when this Technician is added to a work order. Typically, this field would be flagged for a "non-tech" (such as a billing agent).</p>
<p>If this field is not flagged, "Tech Based" events (any event where to Notify Id points to the Technician radio button) from the Escalation Profile will continue to be duplicated when a new or additional tech is assigned to a work order.</p>
<h3>12.12.3 Technician List View</h3>
<p>The Technician Email field has been added to the TechniciansByPhone list.</p>
<h2>12.13 Automatic Generation of Web Logs into Work Orders</h2>
<p>This enhancement is designed for businesses where web logs created in CRMAnywhere are entered by company/franchise employees. When enabled, these web logs will be used to automatically generate work orders; it is NOT recommended for firms using CRMAnywhere to allow external clients generate web logs.</p>
<p>This enhancement must be implemented via registry to automatically create work orders whenever a Web Log record is made via CRMAnywhere. This eliminates the need for a user to go to New Call and import a web log entry in most cases. NOTE:&#160;&#160;Scheduled Event Manager already includes code that checks for new Web Log entries that need escalated.&#160;&#160;Additional code now takes that one step further and auto-creates a work order when the new registry setting is enabled. When the work order is successfully generated, the web log will be set to Acknowledged, just as it would be when it is manually processed in New Call.<br />
<br />
Since CRMAnywhere users only choose a Service Category and not an Equipment Id, this functionality defaults the first Client Site Equipment record for the supplied Service Category into the auto-created work order. For this reason, client site equipment data should be carefully reviewed to ensure that the service category is completed where applicable.</p>
<p>When a work order is auto-generated from a weblog, all of the fields that would default when manually entering the web log and then selecting a Site Equipment record.</p>
<p>If a technician should be assigned to work order, the tech must be specified in the Site/Equipment record.</p>
<p>The Default Service Job fields must be completed in the Site Equipment records.</p>
<p>If a field that is required in New Call does not default in when the web log is processed, an email alert will be sent noting the Weblog Id and the problem. Also, certain types of pop up messages (such as excessive activity message) requiring human invention may prevent the web log from being automatically turned into a work order; in this case, the status of the Web Log will be Unacknowledged. In this case:</p>
<p style="margin-left: 36.00pt;">1. The web log may be manually handled in New Call and converted into a work order.</p>
<p style="margin-left: 36.00pt;">2. The problems which prevented the work order from being automatically generated (often because required fields are not completed) may be corrected, and the web log’s status set back to New. The next time the Scheduled Event Manager runs again, the web log will be processed. This is the preferred method because it will correct the problem for future weblogs.</p>
<p>To implement, the following registry entry is required (and the Scheduled Event Manager must be running). When SEM sees this registry setting it will create a new work order when it processes a weblog entry that is set to ‘new’.</p>
<p>To implement this following registry entry is needed:</p>
<p><font style="font-weight: bold;">Id:</font> sys-ffv-global-settings</p>
<p><font style="font-weight: bold;">Setting Key:</font> AutoCreateWOFromWebLogs Setting Value: true<br />
<br />
The following registry entries are also required: they specify the email address that alert should be forwarded to if a work order fails to be created:</p>
<p><font style="font-weight: bold;">Id:</font> sys-newcall</p>
<p><font style="font-weight: bold;">Setting Key:</font> EmailPostLogsTo&#160;<font style="font-weight: bold;">Setting Value:</font> toemailaddress</p>
<p><font style="font-weight: bold;">Setting Key:</font> EmailPostLogsFrom <font style="font-weight: bold;">Setting Value:</font> fromemailaddress</p>
<p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">&#160;</p>
<h2>12.14 Start Create PM Work Orders</h2>
<h3>12.14.1 Required Resources processing</h3>
<p>In previous releases, if the following registry entry was set: .</p>
<p style="margin-left: 36.00pt;">RegistryID:&#160;&#160;sys-ffv-global-settings<br />
Settings:&#160;&#160;UseWORequiredResources=true</p>
<p>All new Work Orders were set to Waiting Parts, even if the following registry was set to NOT use required resources on PM’s and no parts existed on the PM:</p>
<p style="margin-left: 36.00pt;">RegistryID:&#160;&#160;sys-start-scrtepmwo<br />
Settings:&#160;&#160;DisableReqPMParts=true</p>
<p>In this release PM Work Orders will ONLY be set to Waiting Parts if Required Resource parts (from flagged Service Parts lines) will be written to the PM. Otherwise, PM work orders with no tech assigned will be set to Waiting Service, and PM work orders with a tech assigned will be set to the default status for that type of tech.</p>
<p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">&#160;</p>
<h2>12.15 Skip Archived Work Orders in&#160;Service Billing / Service Worksheet</h2>
<p>When Start Compute Service or Start Compute Service Worksheet is run ‘wide open’, old work orders that will never be billed may be included in the process, negatively impacting performance. In this enhancement, it is easy to exclude archived work orders from the Service Worksheet / Service Invoice starter functions in order to improve performance. Note that Work Orders may be set to Archived by manually adding a Technician line with status Archived, or by using the Start Archive Work Orders or Start Autoarchive Work Orders.</p>
<p>In this release, a new range, Work Order Status Category, has been added to both the Start Compute Service Billing and Start Computer Service Worksheets functions. It is highly recommended that these ranges be set to exclude archived work orders (!=archived) using the following settings:</p>
<p>Id: sys-start-ssrvcebllngcmpte</p>
<p>Setting Key: InitialValueFor~wrkordr.stts-ctgry Setting Value: !=archived</p>
<p>Id: sys-start-ssrvcebllngwrksht</p>
<p>Setting Key: InitialValueFor~wrkordr.stts-ctgry Setting Value: !=archived</p>

<h2>12.16 Time Slotting</h2>
<p style="margin-left: 36.00pt;"><font style="font-weight: bold;">Important note on the v.cus file:<br /></font>If you are upgrading from an earlier version of 8.0, it may be necessary to change your customization file (v.cus) to see the Time Slot Wizard buttons on New Call 2 and the Classic Board WO Summary. If you do not see these buttons and would like this functionality, contact your support representative.</p>
<h3>12.16.1 Time Slotting Overview</h3>
<p>Time slotting allows call center personnel to easily schedule the starting time of new service Work Orders based on the availability of Time Slots for a given day, Service Category and Branch. This functionality would typically be used for residential service calls where the customer appointment would be made first: the Technician assignment could be made at the same time or later.</p>
<p><font style="font-weight: bold;">This functionality requires that GL Reporting Periods are implemented to generate the calendar data required.</font> See <a href="GL_Reporting_Period.htm">GL Reporting Period</a> for details.</p>
<p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">The ‘inventory’ of Time Slots is maintained by the system based on:&#160;</p>
<p style="margin-left: 36.00pt;">The Time Slot Exceptions Tab: enables the user to add/subtract time slots to accommodate rolling schedules, weather, holidays, etc.</p>
<p style="margin-left: 36.00pt;">The Technician Time Slots Tab: specifies which Time Slots/Days are available for each Technician.</p>
<p style="margin-left: 36.00pt;">The Technician Unavailable Tab: specifies days the Tech is not available due to vacation or other reason. Unavailable days will reduce the Time Slot inventory.</p>
<p style="margin-left: 36.00pt;">The Work Order Technician Tab: how many of this Time Slot have already been assigned for a particular day. The available Time Slot inventory is reduced when a Time Slot is assigned to a work order. If a Technician line with a Time Slot is Canceled, it will not be ‘counted’ as being assigned, and that Time Slot will be included in the available Time Slot inventory.</p>
<p>When the Time Slot Wizard is launched from New Call 2, the dispatcher/call center staff will be shown the next available Time Slot with an option to select it, ask for the next available Time Slot or limit the search based on selected days on or after the specified effective date. Once selected, the Time Slot will be stored in the Work Order Technician tab, and set the Work Order’s Scheduled Date and Scheduled Time. The user will be prevented from changing the scheduled Date or Time of any Work Order Technician line where the Time Slot is set.</p>
<h3>12.16.2 New Viewer: Time Slot</h3>
<p><font style="font-weight: bold;">Purpose:</font></p>
<p>This record defines the Time Slots used for scheduling purposes.</p>
<p><font style="font-weight: bold;">Usage:</font></p>
<p>Each Time Slot will reference a specific Service Category and Branch (if used), and Start and End time. For example, if your firm’s HVAC calls could typically be completed within three hours (including travel time), you could create several three hours slots – beginning at 8:00am, 11:00am, and 2:00.</p>
<p><font style="font-weight: bold;">Im</font><font style="font-weight: bold;">portant Fields: Upper Section</font></p>
<p><font style="font-weight: bold;">Time Slot Id:<br /></font>Must uniquely identify this Time Slot.</p>
<p>Care should be taken in formulating these Id’s so that they are meaningful to your call center personnel. For example, the first HVAC slot of the day could be HVAC1. If your firm has Branches implemented, you would need a first HVAC slot defined for each Branch: HVAC1-B2, HVAC1-B2, and so on.</p>
<p><font style="font-weight: bold;">Time Slot Name:<br /></font> Briefly describes this Time Slot (ex, HVAC 8:00 – 11:00am Branch B2).</p>
<p><font style="font-weight: bold;">Start Time: End Time:<br /></font>These fields define the duration of the slot. The Start Time is used to set the Work Order’s Schedule Time. Note that the Work Order’s Estimated Hours will continue to default from the Work Code.</p>
<p><font style="font-weight: bold;">Branch Id:<br /></font>If Branches are implemented, this field should be completed if Time Slots should be maintained by Branch (recommended).</p>
<p><font style="font-weight: bold;">Service Category:<br /></font>The Service Category this slot pertains to. This field is highly recommended.</p>
<p><font style="font-weight: bold;">Time Slot Summary</font><font style="font-weight: bold;">:</font></p>
<p style="margin-left: 36.00pt;"><font style="font-weight: bold;">As Of</font><font style="font-weight: bold;">:<br /></font> The date of interest; may be changed by the user.</p>
<p style="margin-left: 66.25pt;"><font style="font-weight: bold;">Capacity:</font><font style="font-weight: bold;"><br /></font>Slot capacity is dynamically calculated by adding 1 for the slot(s) listed on active technician records for the days specified then subtracting 1 slot if the effective date is listed on the Technician’s Unavailable Tab, and then +/- the number specified on the Time Slot’s Exceptions Tab (if the Work Code is not specified).</p>
<p style="margin-left: 66.25pt;"><font style="font-weight: bold;">Availability:<br /></font>Slot availability is dynamically calculated by adding 1 for the slot(s) listed on active technician records for the days specified then subtracting 1 slot if the effective date is listed on the Technician’s Unavailable Tab, subtracting instances of Time Slot on the Work Order Technician of that day, and then +/- the number specified on the Time Slot’s Exceptions Tab (if the Work Code is not specified).</p>

<p>This tab enables the user to make adjustments by adding to or subtracting from the slots available via the Technician Time Slot and Unavailability Tabs. For example, on a very hot day, extra techs might be called in for HVAC slots.</p>
<p><font style="font-weight: bold;">Date:<br /></font>The date the adjustment will take place.</p>
<p><font style="font-weight: bold;">Work Code Id:<br /></font>If this adjustment should apply to a specific Work Code, enter it here. Work Code specific adjustment will <font style="text-decoration: underline;">not</font> appear on the Time Slot Summary above.</p>
<p><font style="font-weight: bold;">Qty:<br /></font>The number of slots to add or subtract (negative). For example, on a hot day, ‘nocool’ Work Codes could have their quantity increased, and PM Work Codes could be decreased.</p>

<p><img src="image/TimeSlotWizard.gif" alt="image\TimeSlotWizard.gif" title="image\TimeSlotWizard.gif" width="88" height="28" border="0" /><br />
This Wizard will be launched from New Call 2 or the Classic Dispatch Board’s Dispatch Summary by clicking this button. The Wizard will display the next available Time Slots for the applicable Branch, Service Category and (optionally) Work Code. Since the Wizard is aware of the current system time, only Time Slots that have not yet expired and have not been fully allocated will be displayed. When the user clicks on a Time Slot to select it, the Work Order Technician Date Scheduled will be also be set from the Slot the user selected and the Time Scheduled will be set from the Time Slot’s Starting Time. Note that the Estimated Hours will continue to default from the Work Code.</p>
<h3>Important Fields: Upper Section</h3>
<p><font style="font-weight: bold;">Branch: Service Ctgry Id:<br /></font>These display-only fields list the Branch and Service Category of all Open Slots for this work order.</p>
<p><font style="font-weight: bold;">Next Available: Date: Time Slot Name<br />
Time Slot Id: Start Time: End Time:<br /></font> These display-only fields will be base on the selected Open Slot. When the Wizard is launched, the first Open Slot will be selected. If the user selects a different slot by clicking on it, these fields will display the selected Time Slot Line.</p>
<p><font style="font-weight: bold;">Advanced Search:<br /></font>These fields allow you to limit or extend the Time Slot search based on the information the customer provides.</p>

<h2>12.17 Time-of-Service PM Earnings</h2>
<h3>12.17.1 Overview</h3>
<p>The goal of this enhancement is to provide a better matching of the revenue and expenses associated with PM contracts.&#160;&#160;Time-of-Service refers to the fact that the revenue is recognized at the time the PM Inspection work order is completed, as opposed to the rigid earnings schedule currently supported as part of the Site PM Billing record. The system will recognize an accrued liability when the contract invoices are generated, and relieve this liability and recognize income upon completion of the PM work order.</p>
<h3>12.17.2 Master Contract:</h3>
<p><font style="font-weight: bold;">New Field: Time of Service Earn?</font><font style="font-weight: bold;"><br /></font>If this field is flagged, the new Site Equipment PM Schedule's Accrued flag will be checked. When PM Work Orders are generated, PM Work Order will include two lines on the Revenue Adjustments tab.&#160;&#160;One is for recognizing the PM Income.&#160;&#160;The line designated as 'ApplyPrepaid' relieves the accrued liability.&#160;&#160;This will result in a zero-dollar invoice that does the GL transfer. Note that the Time Of Service Billed and the Time of Service Earn fields cannot both be flagged.</p>
<p style="margin-left: 36.00pt;"><font style="font-weight: bold;">Important:</font> The Revenue Adjustment lines DO NOT post to Job History until the work order is designated as completed: the Date Work Completed is not blank.&#160;&#160;When they do post, each line's Date Effective is reset to match the Date Work Completed.</p>
<h3>12.17.3 Client Site Equipment PM Schedule Tab</h3>
<p>Click the Magnify button to see the following field.</p>
<p><font style="font-weight: bold;">New Field: Accrued</font><font style="font-weight: bold;"><br /></font>If this field is flagged, when PM Work Orders are generated, PM Work Order will include two lines on the Revenue Adjustments tab.&#160;&#160;One is for recognizing the PM Income.&#160;&#160;The line designated as 'ApplyPrepaid' relieves the accrued liability.&#160;&#160;This will result in a zero-dollar invoice that does the GL transfer.</p>
<p>If this line was generated from Master Contract, the Accrued box will be checked if the Master Contract Time of Service Earn? Field was checked.</p>
<p style="margin-left: 36.00pt;"><font style="font-weight: bold;">Important:</font> The Revenue Adjustment lines DO NOT post to Job History until the work order is designated as completed: the Date Work Completed is not blank.&#160;&#160;When they do post, each line's Date Effective is reset to match the Date Work Completed.</p>
<h3>12.17.4 Client Site PM Billing Tab</h3>
<p>If you are not using Master Contract, enter the schedule for the advanced billings.&#160;&#160;Because the revenue recognition is based on the completion of the PM work, DO NOT use the Amount Earned field. The Site Equipment records contain the control data for time-of-service earnings.</p>
<h3>12.17.5 Registry Entries for Time Of Service PM Earnings</h3>
<p><font style="font-weight: bold;">Registry Entry to Default PM Billing GL Accounts:</font></p>
<p><font style="font-weight: bold;">Id:</font> sys-ffv-global-settings<br />
<font style="font-weight: bold;">Setting Key:</font> DefaultGLAccountPMIncome&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;<font style="font-weight: bold;">Setting Value:</font> GL Account Id for Normal Income<br />
<font style="font-weight: bold;">Setting Key:</font> DefaultGLAccountPMBilledInAdvance&#160;&#160;<font style="font-weight: bold;">Setting Value:</font> GL Account Id for Normal Liability</p>
<p>Note that The GL transfer to recognize income happens when the zero-dollar invoice is printed and posted.</p>
<p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">&#160;</p>
<p><font style="font-weight: bold;">Registry Entry to Enable Revenue Adjustments on PreventiveMaint Work Orders</font></p>
<p>Additional data entry controls have been implemented in the Work Order viewer.&#160;&#160;Access to the Revenue Adjustments tab is now denied on PreventiveMaint-type work orders.&#160;&#160;This includes line inserts and line deletes. A registry entry is available to override this, but is not recommended:<br />
<br />
<font style="font-weight: bold;">Id:</font> sys-viewer-vwrkordr<br />
<font style="font-weight: bold;">Setting Key:</font> PreventRevenueAdjustmentAccessOnPMWorkOrders<br />

<p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">&#160;</p>
<h2>12.18 Taylor Universal Work Orders</h2>
<p>In the Taylor UWO system, type 3 records are used to report the contents of a Work Order's "Other" tab (as well as the "Labor" tab). The value of "<font style="font-weight: bold; text-decoration: underline;">M</font>" (for Material) entered into the Type 3 "Other" records "Category" field. In this release, an exception to the above is made for PM Work Orders. These are identified by the Work Order Type column having a value of "preventivemaint". Type 3 "Other" records deriving from PM Work Orders should have the "Category" field set to "<font style="font-weight: bold; text-decoration: underline;">L</font>" (for Labor).</p>
<p>'Other Charges' are no longer omitted from the UWO file in this image. In addition, this also corrects the formatting of negative numbers For example when -.5 was being formatted for a 6 character integer field it would previously appear as '000-.5'; now it is correctly generated as '-000.5'.</p>
<p><font style="font-weight: bold;">Note:</font> If you were on an earlier version of 8.0, run the Start Function Update to add this new function to the starter list and enable its context-specific help.</p>
<h3>12.18.1 Start Taylor Universal Work Order Generation</h3>
<h3>Purpose:</h3>
<p>This function is used to generate Taylor Universal Work Orders that may then be uploaded to Taylor.</p>
<h3>Usage:</h3>
<p>Taylor Distributors must transmit a complex file to Taylor Corporate for each invoiced Work Order that they wish to report. This is known as the “Universal Work Order” or “UWO” field. In addition to the generation of this “UWO” file, Sampro keeps track of the work orders already processed in a “Transmissions” database table.</p>
<h3>Important Fields: Range Screen</h3>
<p><font style="font-weight: bold;">Start Date: Cutoff Date:</font></p>
<p>Both of these fields default to today. The Work Order’s Date Closed must fall between the Start Date and the Cutoff Date (inclusive).</p>
<p><font style="font-weight: bold;">New Button:</font> <font style="font-weight: bold;">Select Individual WOs: (Enter Work Order List)</font></p>
<p>When you click this button, the list of applicable work orders will appear based on the Start and Cutoff Date and the following rules:</p>
<p style="margin-left: 36.00pt;">The Work Order must not be flagged as ‘Private’: if the WO Priority is set to 7, the Work Order is considered private.</p>
<p style="margin-left: 36.00pt;">The Work Order must have been already invoiced.</p>
<p style="margin-left: 36.00pt;">The Work Order must not appear in the Transmissions table.</p>
<h3>Important Fields: WO List Screen</h3>
<p>The user may add or remove Work Orders from the list. To remove a Work Order, simply clear the WO Id that you wish to remove. A Work Order may be added by entering its Id or double-clicking to select from a list.</p>
<p><img src="image/go.gif" alt="image\go.gif" title="image\go.gif" width="48" height="28" border="0" /> <img src="image/SKIN1_Go.gif" alt="image\SKIN1_Go.gif" title="image\SKIN1_Go.gif" width="94" height="28" border="0" /></p>
<p>When the user presses the “Go” button on the Work Order List screen, a File Dialog will appear to allow the user to select the file in which to place the UWO file. After the user selects a file, the UWO file will be generated and the Transmissions Table will be updated accordingly.</p>
<p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">&#160;</p>
<h3>12.18.2 Registry for Start Taylor Universal Work Order Generation</h3>
<h3>Purpose:</h3>
<p class="No_Spacing" style="margin-left: 5.75pt;">Provide required values for Taylor Universal Registry Entries.</p>
<h3>Important Fields:</h3>
<p><font style="font-weight: bold;">Registry Id:</font> sys-Taylor-UWO</p>
<h3>Taylor Distributor and Branch</h3>
<p><font style="font-weight: bold;">Setting Key</font>: DistributorNo <font style="font-weight: bold;">Setting Value:</font> Value supplied to distributor by Taylor</p>
<p><font style="font-weight: bold;">Setting Key:</font> DistributorBranch <font style="font-weight: bold;">Setting Value:</font> Value supplied to distributor by Taylor</p>
<h3>Function Mode</h3>
<p><font style="font-weight: bold;">Setting Key:</font> Mode <font style="font-weight: bold;">Setting Value:</font> Run in Kappus mode if set to OldKappus</p>
<p>The software will run in regular mode if this entry is omitted.</p>
<h3>Minimum Line Count:</h3>
<p><font style="font-weight: bold;">Setting Key:</font> Minimum Line Count <font style="font-weight: bold;">Setting Value:</font> NumberOfLines</p>
<p>Controls the minimum number of lines to include ton the Work Order List screen</p>
<h3>UWO Default File Path/Filename</h3>
<p><font style="font-weight: bold;">Setting Key:</font> UWOFilePath <font style="font-weight: bold;">Setting Value:</font> The default file path for the generated UWO file.</p>
<p style="margin-top: 0.00pt;">(e.g., \\myserver\sampro\export\UWO.txt)</p>
<h3>12.18.2a Specify Vendor Id for Taylor</h3>
<p>As part of the UWO, Taylor's part number for a part must be reported. Previously, this could only be obtained from the Inventory Item Vendor table using the Inventory Item's default Vendor. This release provides a registry option to identify the Sampro Vendor Id for Taylor, so that this does not have to be set as the Default Vendor for each Taylor part.</p>
<p>Registry Id: sys-taylor-uwo</p>
<p>Setting Key: VendorIdForTaylor Setting Value: <font style="font-style: italic;">taylorvendorid</font></p>
<p>The Setting Value should specify the actual Vendor Id for Taylor in your system.</p>
<p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">&#160;</p>
<h3>12.18.3 Taylor Universal Work Order Setup</h3>
<h3>Purpose:</h3>
<p>Taylor Distributors must transmit a complex file to Taylor Corporate for each invoiced Work Order that they wish to report. This is known as the “Universal Work Order” or “UWO” field. In addition to the generation of this “UWO” file, Sampro keeps track of the work orders already processed in a “Transmissions” database table.</p>
<p>Certain database fields must be set up correctly for this functionality to be operational: these fields are discussed in this topic.</p>
<h3>About the Transmissions Table</h3>
<p>The name of the Transmissions Table is “TylrUwoTrnsmssns”. This table is automatically created when Sampro identifies that it is needed. There is currently no Sampro Viewer for this table.</p>
<p>The columns in this table are:</p>
<p style="margin-left: 36.00pt;">tylruwotrnsmssns_rn&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;numeric(10,0) NOT NULL UNIQUE,&#160;</p>
<p style="margin-left: 36.00pt;">tylruwotrnsmssns_id &#160;&#160;&#160;char(10) NOT NULL UNIQUE,&#160;</p>
<p style="margin-left: 36.00pt;">wrkordr_rn &#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;numeric(10,0) NOT NULL,&#160;</p>
<p style="margin-left: 36.00pt;">tylruwotrnsmssns_invce_nmbr&#160;&#160;char(10) NOT NULL,&#160;</p>
<p style="margin-left: 36.00pt;">tylruwotrnsmssns_dte_snt&#160;&#160;&#160;char(10) NOT NULL&#160;</p>
<h3>Normal Mode vs. Kappus Mode</h3>
<p>Fields in the UWO file are computed based on certain ‘conventions’ employed by the installer when setting up the Sampro Database. While the base package has one set of conventions, Kappus has its own set. To account for this, UWO generation can run in ‘regular’ or ‘Kappus’ mode. This is controlled by entries in the Sampro Registry as described below.</p>
<p>The base package implementation of this function uses the Work Code Id to as the fail code and the Resolution Code Id as the resolution code.</p>
<h3>“Regular” conventions</h3>

If this Web Log was generated by a Technician or Subcontractor user, the Technician Id and Name will appear in this display-only field.</p>
<p class="No_Spacing" style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">&#160;</p>
<h2>12.20 Notification Category</h2>
<p><font style="font-weight: bold;">Changed Field: Source - Web User option added</font><font style="font-weight: bold;"><br /></font>SAMPro supports the ability to trigger web log escalation events based on the web log being set to duplicate or cancelled. In this release, the executed event may also be set to notify the requester (web user) by creating a Notification Category with the Source set to Web User. This Notification Category could then be referenced in an Escalation Profile for Web Logs so that appropriate notifications could be sent to the Web User's Email address.</p>
<p class="No_Spacing" style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">&#160;</p>
<h2>12.21 Start Renew Service Contracts</h2>
<p>This function now renews PM Billing lines marked Ok to Renew even if they do not have a corresponding Site Equipment PM Schedule entry (referencing the same job) marked OK to renew.</p>
<p>This function also handles Renewals for Time of Service Earned (with an Accrual amount in the Client Site Equipment PM Schedule) correctly.</p>
<h1>13 Requisitioning</h1>
<h2>13.1 Requisitioning and PM Work Orders</h2>
<p>In this release PM Work Orders will ONLY be set to Waiting Parts if Required Resource parts (from flagged Service Parts lines) will be written to the PM. Otherwise, PM work orders with no tech assigned will be set to Waiting Service, and PM work orders with a tech assigned will be set to the default status for that type of tech. See user note 12.14.1 for details.</p>
<h2>13.2 Material Requisitioning – Branch Level Processing and Other Enhancements</h2>
<p>On the Work Order Required Resource tab, the Quantity On-Hand and Available calculations now use branch-specific Material Requisitioning registry entries (sys-viewer-vshpordr-<font style="font-style: italic;">branchid</font><font style="font-style: italic;">)</font> when available.</p>
<p>This release supports Requisitioning at the Branch level. The following enhancements have been implemented so that ‘From’ and ‘Staging’ location may be specified for each Branch.</p>
<h3>13.2.1 Shop Order Registry</h3>
<p>Branch settings now override the non-branch standard settings (branch derived from WO/Job):</p>
<p><font style="font-weight: bold;">Id:</font> sys-viewer-vshpordr-<font style="font-style: italic;">branchid</font></p>
<p><font style="font-weight: bold;">Registry Option for NonStocked Items</font></p>
<p style="margin-left: 36.00pt;">This release supports a new registry option for a default location for non-stocked inventory items in the sys-viewer-vshpordr / sys-viewer-vshpordr-<font style="font-style: italic;">branchid</font></p>
<p style="margin-left: 36.00pt;"><font style="font-weight: bold;">Setting Key:</font> MaterialRequisitionFromLocationNonStocked</p>
<p style="margin-left: 36.00pt;"><font style="font-weight: bold;">Setting Value:</font> <font style="font-style: italic;">LocationIdforNonStocked</font></p>
<p style="margin-left: 36.00pt;">&#160;</p>
<p><font style="font-weight: bold;">Registry to Use</font> <font style="font-weight: bold;">WO RR Location</font> <font style="font-weight: bold;">(deprecated)</font></p>
<p style="margin-left: 36.00pt;">This registry option is <font style="font-weight: bold;">not</font> recommended. When shop orders are generated for Materials Requisitioning, the user-specified location (in the Work Order Required Resource Tab) will only override the default location ‘From’ registry settings for the From location if this registry is in effect:</p>
<p style="margin-left: 36.00pt;"><font style="font-weight: bold;">Setting Key:</font> UseWORequiredResourceLocation <font style="font-weight: bold;">Setting Value:</font> true</p>
<h3>13.2.2 Start Material Requisitioning</h3>
<p><font style="font-weight: bold;">New Range: Branch Id:</font></p>
<p>This new range implements Branch filtering for this function.</p>
<p>If hard-block Branch filtering is enabled (with the sys-ffv-global-settings option BranchFilterWithHardBlock set to true), the Branch Id will automatically be set to the user’s Branch filter: even if the user clears the Branch Id range, only those Branches that match his or her Branch filter (in the User record) will appear.</p>
<h3>13.2.3 Start Create PM Work Order</h3>
<p>When this function is run, the Location field of Requisition lines will remain blank; it is no longer set from the default technician’s location.</p>
<h3>13.2.4 Start Tech Material Pickup</h3>
<p>This function now supports Branch Processing.</p>
<p><font style="font-weight: bold;">Changed Field: &#160;Transfer From:</font><br />
This display-only field specifies the Staging Location inventory is being pulled from. It defaults from the MaterialRequisitionToLocation=staginglocation option of the sys-viewer-vshpordr (or sys-viewer-vshpordr-BranchId if branches are enabled) registry entry.</p>
<p><font style="font-weight: bold;">New Field: Technician Id</font><br />
This field defaults from the Work Order's Primary Technician (first Tech on the Technicians tab) but may be changed by the user. This field provides a new way of specifying the 'To' Location; when the Technician defaults or is selected, the Transfer To: location is set to the Tech's truck location.</p>
<p><font style="font-weight: bold;">Changed Field: Location Id:</font><br />
When the Work Order is first entered, this display-only field defaults from the Work Order header. If the Technician Id is changed, it displays the Tech's truck location.</p>
<p><font style="font-weight: bold;">Changed</font> <font style="font-weight: bold;">Field: Transfer To:</font><br />
If the Work Order is assigned to a Technician, this field defaults from the Tech's truck location. The user may change the Location (if needed) directly or by changing the Technician Id. When the user clicks Go, the transfer will be made to the Location specified in this field.</p>
<h3><span style="font-weight: bold;">13.3 &#160;Shop Order Record Transfer Ticket (for requisitioned items)</span></h3>
<p>Empty reversing lines for GL History are no longer generated when a Shop Order Record Pick List entry generated for requisitioning is edited; these entries do not generate GL History in the first place.</p>
<p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">&#160;</p>
<p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">&#160;</p>
<h1>14 Manufacturing/Client Orders</h1>
<h2>14.1 Client Orders</h2>
<p>This release corrects a problem in V8.0.510.025-028 where the Shipping address failed to populate from the Site record, and upon entering an inventory item, the inventory item pricing did not default in.</p>
<p>The system now allows changes to the Sales Tax Group in Client Orders.</p>
<h3>14.1.1 Items Tab</h3>
<p>This release corrects a problem where the GL Entity did not default correctly from the Client Site COP tab if you entered items after manually changing the Client Order’s Location Id. Note that if the GL Entity is specified on the Location record, it continues to override the GL entity specified on the Client Site and Inventory Item Group.</p>
<p>This release corrects an Invalid Column Name error when selecting a Serial Number from the list. The list of Serial numbers is also filtered to the selected Inventory Item Id. &#160;</p>
<h3>14.1.2 Deposit Tab (removed)</h3>
<p>Client Order: The COP Deposit child tab and GL Deposit Account from have been removed from the default Client Order viewer since the Deposit functionality is not supported in this version. If necessary, the following registry may be used to re-enables the Deposits child tab.&#160;&#160;If a user needs to do this, they will also a need a new v.cus file that includes Deposit GL Account on the parent A/R tab.</p>
<p>Id: sys-viewer-vclntordr</p>
<p>Setting Key: ShowDepositTab Setting Value: true</p>
<h3>14.1.3 Closing Client Orders</h3>
<p>COP Client Orders are only closed during invoicing when there are no allocated or back ordered items on the order. In previous releases, if backordered/allocated items were removed from the order after invoicing, there was no way to set the Closed Date on the order, so that it would remain on the active list. In this release, if you remove all backordered/allocated items from an invoiced COP Client Order, the system will display the following when you save the Order:</p>
<p style="margin-left: 36.00pt;">This Order Does not Allocate or Back Order Any Stock.</p>
<p style="margin-left: 36.00pt;">Do You Wish To Close This Order At This Time?</p>
<p>If you click Yes, the Date Closed will be set. If you click No, the Order will remain open.</p>
<p><font style="font-weight: bold;">Changed Field - Date Closed:<br /></font> The Date Closed field is now enabled for input to allow the user to close Quote and Hold type Client Orders. Validation will not allow a date to be entered if it would be invalid to close the order (i.e. it includes any open allocations or back orders) for Order, Sample, and Transfer type orders.</p>
<h3>14.1.4 Freight Tax</h3>
<p>Calculation of Freight Tax on COP invoices is now based on the Client Order's Sales Tax Group, not the Client Site COP tab Sales Group; if tax is not charged on the sold items by the taxing group, no tax will apply to the freight.</p>
<p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">&#160;</p>
<h2>14.2 Client Order Invoice</h2>
<p>If the global registry entry CopTaxOnFreightStates is set for a Site’s state, sales tax should be assessed on freight unless the Tax Exempt flag is set on the Site COP tab. In this release, taxes for Tax Exempt Sites are no longer erroneously assessed on COP freight on the COP Invoice.</p>
<p>The Client Site COP Tax Exempt field in tax calculations is now included in COP Invoice calculations. If this box is flagged, sales tax will not be included on the COP Invoice.</p>
<h3>14.2.1 Portrait Invoice Format</h3>
<p>A new COP Invoice format is available in this image; it prints in portrait orientation, and will fit in most typical window envelopes when folded. If you choose to use it, it will be necessary to update your COP Invoice graphics files.</p>
<p>The following registry option enables the new portrait format:</p>
<p><font style="font-weight: bold;">Registry Id:</font> sys-printer-rcopinvce</p>
<p><font style="font-weight: bold;">Setting Key:</font>orientation <font style="font-weight: bold;">Setting Value:</font> 1</p>
<p style="margin-left: 36.00pt;"><font style="font-weight: bold;">Note:</font><br />
The sys-report-rcopinvce registry (or registries) should initially be edited so that the additional line registry options are disabled: they may be re-enabled if needed for your particular data.</p>
<p>The new portrait version of the COP Invoice also supports the use of E (external notes). E notes are enabled by entering the string &lt;E&gt; in the text of a Note attached to the Client Order.</p>
<h3>14.2.2 Sales Tax Computation</h3>
<p>In previous releases, flagging a Client Site as Tax Exempt for COP Invoices (on the COP Tab) did not always result in a tax exempt COP Invoice. This release, a Site flagged at Tax Exempt on the COP tab is always TAX EXEMPT for COP processing regardless of whether the item is marked as Taxable or Non-taxable.&#160;&#160;Sites not marked as Tax Exempt will adhere to rules of the item marked TAXABLE or NONTAXABLE, <font style="text-decoration: underline;">unless there is a default cost category associated to the Inventory Group</font>.&#160;&#160;Tax rules will follow the cost category rules for the tax authority (Tax Material, Tax Other, No Tax Sub, No Tax Labor).</p>
<p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">&#160;</p>
<h2>14.3 COP Acknowledgement Report</h2>
<p>This report now suppresses the estimated sales tax if the Site COP tab has the Tax Exempt box flagged.</p>
<h2>14.4 COP Pick Ticket Entry</h2>
<p>Previously, if you did not select a Pick Ticket #, clicking the Print Packing Slip defaulted a ‘0’ to the report’s Pick Ticket range. In this release, the report’s Pick Ticket range will only be completed if the Pick Ticket # is set in the viewer.</p>
<h2>14.5 Fill Backorders</h2>
<p>This release corrects a problem in the Fill Backorders routine that sometimes resulted in the Pick List Entry function displaying zero lines for orders with the Allow Partial Ship flag cleared.</p>

If the PRS Reimb Code is completed, TechAnywhere Other tab entries will be posted to the Labor Journal Other tab as a reimbursable. If this field is blank, TechAnywhere Other entries will continue to post to the Work Order Other tab.</p>
<h2>15.4 Technician and Part Runner Mode</h2>
<p>The TechAnywhere Android setup will allow a technician to work in 1 of 2 ways: Technician mode or Part Runner mode.</p>
<p style="margin-left: 36.00pt;">In Technician mode, the tech can view purchase orders that contain un-received items that are associated with any of his assigned work orders. The tech can mark the items received in TechAnywhere, which will create an inventory receipt journal transaction to mark those items received in SAMPro. The tech also has the ability to change the associated site equipment record on the item which will then change the purchase order and purchase order history to reflect the new equipment.</p>
<p style="margin-left: 36.00pt;">In Part Runner mode, the technician has access to ANY purchase order that contains any un-received items. In this mode, technician does NOT have the ability to change the associated equipment record, but may mark items as received.</p>
<p>Contact your TechAnywhere support rep to enable this feature for your technicians.</p>
<h2>15.5 Service Recommendations</h2>
<p>Web logs may now be recorded by equipment. When a Web Log with the Equipment Id set is processed in New Call, it does not automatically select the Equipment.</p>

<p>This release corrects the syntax error ‘Column “clntste_nme” found in more than one table’ when logging on with a deprecated Technician/Client record (rather than Web User).</p>
<h2>16.1 Client Web Interface – Appointment Confirmation</h2>
<p>This enhancement is designed to allow customers (typically residential customers not normally set up with a full Web User account for CRMAnywhere) to log on as a guest and confirm or reject an appointment for a service call. The customer will receive an email generated via escalation manager that will include a link to the CRMAnywhere Appointment Confirmation page; once there they can confirm or reject the appointment.</p>
<h3>16.1.1 Graphics Setup</h3>
<p>A banner for the Confirm Appointment page, named appointment.gif, and a sidebar logo named sidebarLogoOnly. They should conform to the standards for the other CRMAnywhere banners and sidebars:</p>
<p>If the web-settings registry specifies the New Headers format (Setting Key: NewHeaders Setting Value: true):</p>
<p style="margin-left: 36.00pt;">The right-hand side of the header should be named right.gif. It should be 68 pixels high, and wide enough to display the desired graphic. This graphic is also used in the other CRMAnywhere screens.</p>
<p style="margin-left: 36.00pt;">The gif containing the title (e.g., Confirm Appointment) should be wide enough to display the appropriate title, and be 68 pixels high. This graphic will be centered in the header, and must be named appointment.gif.</p>
<p style="margin-left: 36.00pt;">A one or two pixel wide and 68 pixel high vertical slice of the graphic’s background should be named slice.gif. This graphic will be repeated as the header background, and is used in the other CRMAnywhere pages.</p>
<p style="margin-left: 36.00pt;">A sidebar area - 112 pixels wide by 440 pixels high, named sidebarLogoOnly.gif. Note that a menu will NOT appear on the sidebar in the Confirm Appointment screen.</p>
<p>If the web-settings registry does NOT specify the New Headers format:</p>
<p style="margin-left: 36.00pt;">The gif containing the title (e.g., Confirm Appointment) should be wide enough to display the appropriate title, and be 68 pixels high and of the same width as your other CRMAnywhere banners. This graphic will be left-justified against the sidebar graphic. It should be named appointment.gif.</p>
<p style="margin-left: 36.00pt;">A sidebar area - 112 pixels wide by 440 pixels high, named sidebarLogoOnly.gif. Note that a menu will NOT appear on the sidebar in the Confirm Appointment screen.</p>
<h3>16.1.2 Registry</h3>

<h3>URL for Guest Page</h3>
<p><font style="font-weight: bold;">Setting Key:</font> URL <font style="font-weight: bold;">Setting Value:</font> URL of guest page</p>
<h3>Statuses for Confirmed and Rejected Work Order</h3>
<p>These options control the status changes that will occurred when the customer confirms or rejects the appointment. Only WO Tech lines with the Date/Time Scheduled that match the web page get updated to the new status. The WO Escalation Status gets updated when the WO is escalated which happens shortly after updating the WO Tech lines.</p>
<p><font style="font-weight: bold;">Setting Key:</font> ConfirmedStatus <font style="font-weight: bold;">Setting Value:</font> valid WO log status (e.g., Scheduled)</p>
<p><font style="font-weight: bold;">Setting Key:</font> RejectedStatus <font style="font-weight: bold;">Setting Value:</font> valid WO log status (e.g., Rescheduled)</p>
<h3>Messages for Confirmed and Rejected Work Orders</h3>
<p>These options specify the message to display when an appointment is confirmed or rejected.</p>
<p><font style="font-weight: bold;">Setting Key:</font> ConfirmedMessage <font style="font-weight: bold;">Setting Value:</font> message for confirmed appointment</p>
<p><font style="font-weight: bold;">Setting Key:</font> RejectedMessage <font style="font-weight: bold;">Setting Value:</font> message for rejected appointment</p>
<h3>Specify the password and user id for the Guest page</h3>

<h3>16.1.4 Escalation Profile</h3>
<p>New Token: ^confirmappointmentlink^</p>
<p>A new Escalation Profile token has been implemented as part of this enhancement.&#160;&#160;The token entered into the profile should read ^confirmappointmentlink^.&#160;&#160;This token will be replaced by a web link to the guest page when the scheduled event executes; the customer will simply click this link to access the Appointment Confirmation page.</p>
<p>The link consists of these components: the URL from the registry entry, the guest account login from the registry, the work order id and rn, and the scheduled event id which generated the e-mail. The id, rn and event values are extracted from the link and used to 'authenticate' the incoming request.&#160;&#160;SQL statements confirm that the values make sense relative to one another.&#160;&#160;Access is denied when the link's values are not successfully authenticated.</p>
<p style="margin-left: 30.25pt;"><font style="text-decoration: underline;">Example: Escalation Profile</font></p>

<p style="margin-left: 36.00pt;">The Document Category must exactly correspond to one referenced in the registry setting</p>
<p style="margin-left: 36.00pt;">The Document Name should briefly describe the document: it will be displayed on the Other Documents page.</p>
<p style="margin-left: 36.00pt;">The Document must be flagged as CRM Web Viewable</p>
<p>In the References list, enter the Table Name field as Document, and select any Reference Id. If you do not complete this step, your document will not appear on SAMPro’s View Document list (although it will appear in CRMAnywhere).</p>
<p>If the document is only good for a limited time, clearing the CRM Web Viewable flag will remove it from the CRMAnywhere View Document list.</p>
<h3>16.2.3 Other Documents Page Graphic</h3>
<p>The graphic for the top banner must be named view_other_documents.gif and should be formatted in the same manner as your other banner title files (such as siteview.gif).</p>
<h2>16.3 Client Web Open Work Order List</h2>
<p>The user is allowed to specify the columns of information that may be displayed in the Open Work Orders list using the woopencolumns and woopentitles registry options. The Work Order Name has been added to the list of columns that may be specified as woname. The Work Order Name has not been added to the default display.</p>
<p>The Web Log Id (labeled Service Request in CRM) has been added to the CRM Anywhere Work Order list default displays so that users can better track their Service Requests as the default display. To add the Service Request to a custom list use the column name servicerequest.</p>
<h2>16.4 Client Web Completed Work Order Lists</h2>
<p>The Web Log Id (labeled Service Request in CRM) has been added to the default CRM Anywhere Work Order lists so that users can better track their Service Requests. To add the Service Request to a custom list use the column name servicerequest.</p>
<p style="margin-left: 36.00pt;"><font style="font-weight: bold;">Note: Work Order Viewer: Web Log Field</font></p>
<p style="margin-left: 36.00pt;">The display-only Web Log field has been added to the Invoicing tab of the Work Order. If the Work Order was created from a Web Log, the Web Log details will also be displayed. Any function capable of creating a new work order (New Call for example) from an existing Web Log entry will now set this field.</p>
<p style="margin-left: 36.00pt;">The new field is not being retroactively loaded during database conversion due to concerns about performance. However, a script may be used to update the new field from existing data: contact your support representative for details.</p>
<h2>16.5 Client Web Site View Page</h2>
<p>Previously, if the option disablecrmmanagequotes was set to true in the web-settings registry to remove the Manage Quotes page, the Quote table was also suppressed in the Site View page. In this release, the Quote table is also suppressed when this option is implemented in the registry tab of the Web Profile or Web User record.</p>
<h2>16.6 Client Web New Service Request Page</h2>
<p>The title of the ‘Web User’ field on the New Service Request page has been change to ‘Requested By’.</p>

<p>When a PO General line is generated from SubAnywhere, the GL Account is only set from the ‘misc’ inventory group it the GL Account was empty.</p>
<p>In this release, the Work Performed is always posted to the Work Order. Previously, Work Performed was not being posted if the Original Work Order Id was completed.</p>
<p>In this release, you may disable collateral entered in SubAnywhere from attaching to the Work Order equipment by implementing the option detailed in user note 2.35.</p>
<h1>19 ServiceChannel FMMS</h1>
<p style="margin-left: 8px;">Corrects an error processing Service Requests containing an '&amp;' character.</p>
<p style="margin-left: 8px;">ServiceChannel was sending invalid data in an IVR check in/out. Bad data causing Key is Missing error, stopping the Scheduled Event Manager. &#160;In this release, the bad check in/out data is ignored.</p>
<p style="margin-left: 8px;"><span style="text-align: justify;">This release corrects a problem where labor charges were added into the Other charges total of the ServiceChannel invoice CSV.</span></p>
<p>If a CHECK IN XML packet omits the SCHED_DATETIME field, the system now skips setting the Date and Time Scheduled on the Work Order's Technicians tab instead of erring out.</p>
<p>This release creates the fmmsinfo and fmmsmppng tables with the required unique indexes.</p>
<p>When the New Call user selects an incoming Service Channel Dispatch, a dialog box appears. A new button, 'Assign To WO' has been added: when clicked, a dialog requesting the entry of an existing Work Order Id appears. Once a valid Work Order has been entered, the new Dispatch will be attached to that Work Order.</p>
<p>Now performs UTF-8 encoded unicode conversions on Service Channel data used to generate weblogs. This corrects a problem which resulted in garbage characters printing on invoices (generated from work orders created from the web logs) and then in a failure when the invoice was saved as a PDF to be emailed to the customer.</p>
<p>Corrects a problem in an environment with ServiceChannel and TechAnywhere where the Warning popup "This work order has open assignments to remote technicians" prevented ServiceChannel from making updates to a workorder that was assigned to a TechAnywhere technician.</p>
<p>This release improves the stability of the ServiceChannel service by&#160;specially&#160;handling malformed data from ServiceChannel.</p>
<p>Corrects a sporadic problem where status updates changes were lost if the Work Order was open in SAMPro when a check-in or check out was sent by Service Channel.</p>

<p>To prevent naming conflicts the Archive and Reject folders are included in the naming conflict resolution.</p>
<p>Better handling of bad data occasionally sent to us from ServiceChannel.</p>
<h2>19.1 Multiple Company/PIN Support (sys-fmms-vendor-servicechannel-pin)</h2>
<h3>Purpose:</h3>
<p>This registry entry supports multi-company certificates for uploaded invoices.</p>
<h3>Related Registry Options:</h3>
<p>In add to the multi-company entries discussed in this topic, the base sys-fmms-servicechannel entry must also be implemented.</p>
<h3>Usage:</h3>
<p>Invoices are uploaded to ServiceChannel by sending them an email with an attached spreadsheet. For each work order, the spreadsheet includes a userId and a password. Previously, the userId and password are derived from the Sampro Registry sys-fmms-vendor-servicechannel, supporting only a single userId and password contained in the registry entry. This results in the sending of the same userId/password pair for every work order regardless of the Sampro 'company'.</p>
<p><br />
This procedure has been enhanced so that userId/password used is dependent on the corresponding work order. This release provides a mechanism for implementing multiple userId/Password pairs when uploading invoices to ServiceChannel. The technique used is to provide for PIN based overrides in the Sampro ‘sys-fmms-vendor-servicechannel’ registry entry.<br />
<br />
It work likes this:<br />
•&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;The entire registry entry is retrieved from the Sampro Registry for the ‘sys-fmms-vendor-servicechannel’ key as usual.<br />
•&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;The entire registry entry is retrieved from the Sampro Registry for the ‘sys-fmms-vendor-servicechannel-pin-XXXX’ key (where ‘XXXX’ is the pin identified by the work order).<br />
•&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;The two entries are merged. Where there are duplicate entries, the second pin based registry takes precedence.<br />
<br />
To implement the correct userId/password uploading for multi-company users, you must create a ‘sys-fmms-vendor-servicechannel-pin-XXXX’ for each company’s pin. The only lines required are the InvoiceUID and InvoicePWD lines. For single company users, the invoiceUID and InvoicePWD lines can remain in the normal 'sys-fmms-vendor-servicechannel' registry entry.</p>
<h3>Important Fields:</h3>
<p><font style="font-weight: bold;">Id:</font> sys-fmms-vendor-servicechannel-pin-<font style="font-style: italic;">XXXX</font></p>
<p>Where <font style="font-style: italic;">XXXX</font> is replaced by the PIN provided by Service Channel. Note that individual registry entries must be created for all applicable PIN’s.</p>
<h3>Required Settings for Multi-Company Use:</h3>
<p><font style="font-weight: bold;">Setting Key</font>: InvoiceUID &#160;<font style="font-weight: bold;">Setting Value:</font> <font style="font-style: italic;">User Id provided by Service Channel</font></p>
<p><font style="font-weight: bold;">Setting Key:</font> InvoicePIN &#160;&#160;&#160;<font style="font-weight: bold;">Setting Value:</font> IVRPINNumber</p>
<p>Make sure to specify the User Id and IVRPIN Number appropriate to the PIN specified in this registry entry.</p>
<h3>Customer and Store Id Overrides</h3>
<p><font style="font-weight: bold;">Setting Key:</font> StoreId&#160;&#160;<font style="font-weight: bold;">Setting Value:</font> <font style="font-style: italic;">provided by Service Channel</font></p>
<p><font style="font-weight: bold;">Setting Key:</font> CustomerId&#160;&#160;<font style="font-weight: bold;">Setting Value:</font> <font style="font-style: italic;">provided by Service Channel</font></p>
<p>StoreId and CustomerId values are needed when sending messages to ServiceChannel. These entries may be used to override the corresponding values in the sys-fmms-vendor-servicechannel registry.</p>
<p style="margin-left: 36.00pt;">This release creates the fmmsinfo and fmmsmppng tables with the required unique indexes.</p>
<p style="margin-left: 36.00pt;">Enhancements to the breakouts available on the Invoice Spreadsheet. See **** for details.</p>
<p style="margin-left: 36.00pt;">When the New Call user selects an incoming Service Channel Dispatch, a dialog box appears. A new button, 'Assign To WO' has been added: when clicked, a dialog requesting the entry of an existing Work Order Id appears. Once a valid Work Order has been entered, the new Dispatch will be attached to that Work Order.</p>
<h2>19.2 &#160;Additional Breakout of Charges for Service Channel</h2>
<p>SAMPro now supports the following charges to be broken out on the ServiceChannel Invoice Spreadsheet: Trip Charge, Material Total, Freight Charge, Markup. Previously, the Trip Charge and the Freight Charge were included in the Material Total. In addition, a separate Markup charge was not reported on the Invoice.</p>
<p>There are separate columns on the spreadsheet for Trip Charge, Material Total, and Freight Charge. The Markup amount is to be reported in the Other Charges columns.</p>
<p>Charges from the Work Order’s Other tab that are not identified as a Freight Charge or a Trip Charge will be included in the ‘Other Charges’ column.</p>
<p style="margin-left: 36.00pt;">If there is exactly one ‘Other Charge’, the Other Rate’s Description will appear in the ‘Other Charges Description’ column.</p>
<p style="margin-left: 36.00pt;">If there is more than one ‘Other Charge’, the word ‘Various’ will appear in the ‘Other Charges Description’ column.</p>
<p>Sampro registry entries will be required to implement these enhancements. The Sampro Registry entry for ‘sys-fmms-vendor-servicechannel’ will be used to identify:</p>
<h3>Other Rate Id’s that Identify Freight Charges</h3>
<p><font style="font-weight: bold;">Setting Key:</font> OtherCodesFreight</p>
<p><font style="font-weight: bold;">Setting Value:</font> A comma separated list of Other Rate Ids identifying Freight Charges.</p>
<h3>Other Rate Id’s that Identify Trip Charges</h3>
<p><font style="font-weight: bold;">Setting Key:</font> OtherCodesTravel</p>
<p><font style="font-weight: bold;">Setting Value:</font> A comma separated list of Other Rate Ids identifying trip charges.</p>
<h3>19.2.1 Other Charge Description Sent to ServiceChannel</h3>
<p>In SAMPro invoices, the description of the ‘other’ charges comes from the Other Rate Description. However, ServiceChannel now only allows the following valid Other Charge Descriptions:</p>
<p style="margin-left: 36.00pt;">Discount<br />
Management Fee<br />
Markup<br />
Overhead &amp; Profit<br />
Rental Fee<br />
Shipping &amp; Handling<br />
Subcontractor Cost<br />
<br />
To ensure that the ServiceChannel invoice conforms to this standard, the following registry should be implemented to statically set the description:</p>
<p><font style="font-weight: bold;">Setting Key:</font> OtherChargesDescription&#160;<font style="font-weight: bold;">Setting Value:</font> valid description<br />
<br />
If this entry is not found the description 'Not Found In Sampro Registry' will be used. Anytime a ServiceChannel invoice is generated and contains a dollar amount in the Other Charges Total section, it will need to use what is specified in the registry.</p>
<h3>19.2.2 Registry Entries to Define Labor and Tax Subcontracting Charges</h3>
<p>This enhancement to Service Channel integration allows users to break out their Labor (Other Rate) subcontracting charges into the 'Labor Total' section of the ServiceChannel invoice format as well as for the tax that they pass on to the customer as an Other Rate to display in the 'Invoice Tax' section of the Service Channel invoice format.</p>
<p><font style="font-weight: bold;">Registry Id:</font> sys-fmms-vendor-servicechannel</p>
<p><font style="font-weight: bold;">Setting Key:</font> OtherCodesLabor <font style="font-weight: bold;">Setting Value:</font> list of other rates for labor</p>
<p><font style="font-weight: bold;">Setting Key:</font> OtherCodesTax <font style="font-weight: bold;">Setting Value:</font> list of other rates for tax</p>
<p>This release supports multiple lines for the same group of Other Codes (e.g. OtherCodesLabor). This is in case there are too many cpdes (e.g. OtherCodesLabor codes) to fit on a single line in the registry entry.</p>
<h2>19.3 Specialized CVS Formatting</h2>
<p><font style="font-weight: bold;">Identifying CVS Clients</font></p>
<p>A Sampro user could potentially have ServiceChannel arrangements for a mixture of CVS and Generic clients. It is assumed that such a user would also produce a uniquely formatted paper invoice format for CVS. Within Sampro, the appropriate invoice format is identified by the Report Query Id found in the appropriate Job Billing Item record.</p>
<h3>Registry to Identify Clients Requiring Special CVS Spreadsheets</h3>
<p><font style="font-weight: bold;">Setting Key:</font> ReportQueriesForMarkupMode</p>
<p><font style="font-weight: bold;">Setting Value:</font> A comma separated list of Report Query Ids</p>
<p>These Report Query Ids will identify clients (via their Billing Items) requiring special CVS formatted ServiceChannel invoice spreadsheet lines.</p>
<p><font style="font-weight: bold;">For CVS type clients</font></p>
<p>Charges will appear in the ‘Freight Charges’ and ‘Trip Charge’ columns as determined by the same mechanism used by the ‘Generic’ type clients.</p>
<p>Charges that would (for ‘Generic type Clients) be included in the ‘Other Charges’ column will now appear in the ‘Material Total’ column. This will free up the ‘Other Charges’ column to be used for Markup.</p>
<p>Charges appearing in the ‘Material Total’ column will have to be classified as either being ‘Marked Up’ or as ‘Flat Rate’. This will be done by examining the charge’s ‘Billing Rate Type’. Charges from the Work Other’s ‘Other’ Tab will be considered as ‘Marked Up’ if and only if the Billing Rate Type is set to one of the ‘markup’ types of markup, margin or multiplier. Charges from the Work Order’s ‘Inventory’ Tab will always be considered as ‘Marked Up’.</p>
<p>If a charge is considered as ‘Marked Up’, the ‘Markup Amount’ will be included in the ‘Other Charges’ column but not in the ‘Material Total’ column.</p>
<p>If it is determined that the ‘Other Charges’ column will be non-zero, the ‘Other Charges Description’ column will be set to ‘Markup’. Otherwise it will be left blank.</p>
<h2>19.4 Do Not Send Public Notes to ServiceChannel</h2>
<p>The following registry may be used to disable sending public notes to ServiceChannel; it would typically be enabled to prevent TechAnywhere created notes from being sent. Since there is not a way to determine if the note came from TechAnywhere or not, the only suitable solution is to create a registry setting that will disable this FMMS functionality.</p>
<p><font style="font-weight: bold;">Registry Id:</font> sys-fmms-vendor-servicechannel</p>
<p style="margin-left: 36.00pt;">(Or sys-fmms-vendorservicechannel--agenttech which will disable this function only for the techanywhere event manager)</p>
<p><font style="font-weight: bold;">Setting Key:</font> UploadNotes &#160;<font style="font-weight: bold;">Setting Value:</font> N</p>
<h2>19.5 Registry Changes for Invoice Format 12</h2>
<p>This release supports Service Channel's Invoice Template 12. A change in the sys-fmms-vendor-ServiceChannel and/or sys-fmms-vendor-ServiceChannel-pin-<font style="font-style: italic;">XXXX</font> registries is necessary is required to support this upgrade:</p>
<p>The Setting Key: InvoicePwd option is no longer used and should be disabled or deleted.</p>
<p>New Required Setting:</p>
<p><font style="font-weight: bold;">Setting Key:</font> InvoicePIN &#160;<font style="font-weight: bold;">Setting Value:</font> <font style="font-style: italic;">IVRPINNumber</font></p>
<p>The value of this setting should the IVR PIN Number used by your company.</p>
<p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">&#160;</p>
<h1>20 Sagequest</h1>
<p>This release includes performance enhancements for SageQuest users running the Start Work Order Daily Edit Performance function.</p>
<h1>21 IVR</h1>
<p>The Logging Pane now updates and Success messages are returned.</p>
<h1>22 DB Analytics</h1>
<h2>22.1 DB Analytics Overview</h2>
<p>DB Analytics is a browser-based dashboard utility that allows users to display Key Performance Indicators (KPI) relevant to their specific department or role. The DB Analytics modules must be enabled in the vrgstry.cus file. Contact your account manager for information on purchasing this new module.</p>
<p>Access to the KPIs in DB Analytics is managed in the much the same way as SAMPro Reports. When a KPI is first installed, its corresponding User Defined Function (automatically created) will be available to members of User Group All only. The SAMPro Administrator (or designated support rep) would then able access to the appropriate User Group or Groups.</p>
<p>DB Analytics may be launched from an active SAMPro session; when it is initiated in this fashion, it supports the launching of SAMPro screens from DB Analytics. For example, the SAMPro Client screen may be launched from the AR Aging Analytic. DB Analytics may also be configured for remote access. If security is a major consideration, access via VPN or a Secure Server should be considered.</p>
<h3>22.1.1 Setup</h3>
<p><font style="font-weight: bold;">GlassFish:</font></p>
<p>DB Analytics requires that the GlassFish Server is installed and running to provide the connection between the DB Analytics browser screens and the SAMPro database. The support document Installing Java GlassFish Server details the installation of the GlassFish Server, its configuration, and the deployment of the SAMProDB.war, SAMProDashboard.war and SAMProFiles.war files required to implement the DB Analytics module.</p>
<p>Typically, GlassFish would be installed on a server by Data-Basics support. If users are allowed to access DB Analytics remotely, this machine will require external exposure. If security is a major consideration, access via VPN or a Secure Server should be considered.</p>
<p><font style="font-weight: bold;">SAMPro</font> <font style="font-weight: bold;">Records:</font></p>
<p style="margin-left: 36.00pt;"><font style="font-weight: bold;">KPIs:</font></p>
<p style="margin-left: 36.00pt;">Typically, all current KPI’s will be imported when support installs DB Analytics. The Start KPI Import function is used to import the KPIs (stored as .obj files) into your database. During the import, each true analytic (Generic Charts/Tables) will have a User Defined Function created for it so that they can be flagged for access on the appropriate User Groups and Functions record(s). See user release note 22.2 for additional information.</p>
<p style="margin-left: 36.00pt;"><font style="font-weight: bold;">User Groups and Functions:</font></p>
<p style="margin-left: 36.00pt;">Start DB Analytics should be flagged as Access for User Groups that should have permission to run DB Analytics from within SAMPro.</p>
<p style="margin-left: 36.00pt;">Like reports, when KPI’s are initially imported, they will only be available to User Group All; access rights to other User Groups should be made as needed by the SAMPro administrator or support.</p>
<p style="margin-left: 36.00pt;"><font style="font-weight: bold;">GL Account Types:</font></p>
<p style="margin-left: 36.00pt;">The successful evaluation of KPI’s for the DB Analytics Dashboard depends upon the correct setting of the Category field your GL Account Type records. See user note 6.1 for details. Your firm’s controller / administrator should review these records and make the appropriate edits.</p>
<p style="margin-left: 36.00pt;"><font style="font-weight: bold;">GL</font> <font style="font-weight: bold;">Reporting Periods:</font></p>
<p style="margin-left: 36.00pt;">GL Reporting Periods should be created and maintained through the end of the current and following year to provide appropriate Calendar Date/Fiscal period information (see user release note 22.6). In particular, if a ‘beginning’ period was established for loading data, the Start Date should be set to the beginning of the loading year, not the ‘blank’ date (01011900).</p>
<p style="margin-left: 36.00pt;"><font style="font-weight: bold;">GLH Summary:</font></p>
<p style="margin-left: 36.00pt;">This table improves performance for the DB Analytics KPIs that need financial data. This table contains a summarized version of the GL History. Start GL History Summary Rebuild is a new starter-type function that updates this table, and should be scheduled for automated processing by the Scheduled Event Manager. A scheduled event should be enabled by your support rep or SAMPro administrator so that this function is run nightly.</p>
<p style="margin-left: 36.00pt;"><font style="font-weight: bold;">Registry Settings:</font></p>
<p style="margin-left: 36.00pt;">A number of registry and users registry settings are required for DB Analytics to be run from an active SAMPro session. These are discussed in user release note 22.5.</p>
<h3>22.1.2 Accessing DB Analytics</h3>
<p>The GlassFish Server must be running to access DB Analytics.</p>
<p><font style="font-weight: bold;">From an Active</font> <font style="font-weight: bold;">SAMPro</font> <font style="font-weight: bold;">Session:</font></p>
<p style="margin-left: 36.00pt;">If the User Registry StartDashboard option is enabled (see user release note 22.5) DB Analytics will start when the user logs into SAMPro. The user will automatically be logged into DB Analytics as well.</p>
<p style="margin-left: 36.00pt;">If the StartDashboard option is not enabled, the user may use Start DB Analytics to start DB Analytics</p>
<p><font style="font-weight: bold;">Remotely:</font></p>
<p style="margin-left: 36.00pt;">If configured for remote access, DB Analytics may be started as desktop shortcut or Favorite in their browser. Chrome and Firefox are preferred. You will be asked to log in using your SAMPro user id and password.</p>
<h3>22.1.3 Configuring DB Analytics</h3>
<p>Typically, the DB Analytics screen will be a blank slate when the user first logs on. The Menu button on the right-hand upper corner of the screen should be used to add Tab Groups, Tabs and Analytics. Additional information on configuring and using DB Analytics is in an illustrated PowerPoint.</p>
<h3>22.1.4 Cloning / Resetting DB Analytics Profiles</h3>
<p><img src="image/CloneProfile.gif" alt="image\CloneProfile.gif" title="image\CloneProfile.gif" width="72" height="28" border="0" /></p>
<p>If several users will be employing the same or similar DB Analytics, the Clone Profile button on the User record (scroll down the parent to access this button) may be used to clone the settings from a selected user who already has them set up.</p>
<p><img src="image/ResetProfile.gif" alt="image\ResetProfile.gif" title="image\ResetProfile.gif" width="72" height="28" border="0" /></p>
<p>The Reset Profile button should only be used to clear a user’s DB Analytic configuration if there is a problem accessing it.</p>
<h3>22.1.4a Exporting/Importing DBAnalytic Profiles</h3>
<p><img src="image/ExportProfile.gif" alt="image\ExportProfile.gif" title="image\ExportProfile.gif" width="72" height="28" border="0" /><br />
’Scroll down the parent screen to access this button; it is designed to be used with DBAnalytics. This button enables you to export the User Profile (KPIs, Tab Groups and Tabs), for this user as an object (.obj) file. This object file may then be imported to provide a preset profile for other users. For example, a support person could use this file to expedite user setups for a new installation.</p>
<p>This file will exported to the main SAMPro directory containing the v.exe image file. The file will use the naming convention exported_DBAnalyticsFrom_databasename_For_userid.obj.</p>
<p><img src="image/ImportProfile.gif" alt="image\ImportProfile.gif" title="image\ImportProfile.gif" width="72" height="28" border="0" /><br />
Scroll down the parent screen to access this button; it is designed to be used with DBAnylytics. This button enables you to import a Profile (KPI’s, Tab Groups and Tabs) from an object (.obj) file. For example, a support person could use this file to expedite user setups for a new installation.</p>
<p>When you click this button, a selection box will appear allowing you to choose from the appropriate objects located in the main SAMPro directory. Click on a file to select it, and then click Select to import the DBAnalytics profile, or Cancel to cancel the operation. When the user next logs into DBAnalytics, the imported profile will be installed.</p>
<h3>22.1.5 DB Analytics Updates</h3>
<h3>DB Analytics Release 0.6.007</h3>
<p style="margin-left: 36.00pt;">Added the ability to open any SAMPro function as a drilldown.</p>
<p style="margin-left: 36.00pt;">Upgraded highcharts from version 2.2.0 to 2.2.3</p>
<p style="margin-left: 36.00pt;">Fixed IE bug where dispatch board would not open if its title contained spaces.</p>
<h3>DB Analytics Release 0.6.008</h3>
<p style="margin-left: 36.00pt;">Corrects an issue on the servlet with saved user connections.</p>
<p style="margin-left: 36.00pt;">Assorted internal fixes.</p>
<h3>DB Analytics Release 0.6.009</h3>
<p style="margin-left: 36.00pt;">Added an option of displaying 5 items for GenericTable</p>
<p style="margin-left: 36.00pt;">Changed Minimum size of an analytic to 100x100 px</p>
<p style="margin-left: 36.00pt;">Added where clause filtering for filter lookups.</p>
<h3>DB Analytics Release 0.6.010</h3>
<p style="margin-left: 36.00pt;">Added&#160;options&#160;of 15 and 20 to the GenericTable 'Show xx entries' drop down.</p>
<p style="margin-left: 36.00pt;">Filtering on any&#160;individual columns will now update all other GenericTables on the page with the filtered values from the master column.</p>
<h3>DB Analytics Release 0.6.011</h3>
<p style="margin-left: 36.00pt;">Added a button to tab settings&#160;page&#160;that&#160;restores all analytics on a tab to defaults.</p>
<p style="margin-left: 36.00pt;">Changed the export to CSV function of data tables so that the default field boundary is a double quote instead of a single quote. Double quote is the default recognized by Excel 2010. CSV files can now be opened directly without display issues in excel.</p>
<p style="margin-left: 36.00pt;">Added a 'Print Visible' and a 'Print All' button to the export&#160;function&#160;of data tables. 'Print all' prints all the data in the table while 'print visible' only prints the items currently shown.</p>
<p style="margin-left: 36.00pt;">Improved the draggable/resizable placement to allow the ability to push analytics around in any direction. Analytics no longer revert to their original state if the altered analytic&#160;is moved back. Analytics can be dragged off the page to the right, and the panel will be scrollable. This change allows better use of different screen sizes without having to change a page.&#160;</p>
<p style="margin-left: 36.00pt;">Created a new algorithm to predict where to insert a new analytic. This finds the next&#160;available&#160;spot in a left to right,&#160;top to bottom manner. Previously new analytics were simply inserted at the bottom of the stack on the left side.</p>
<h3>Release 0.6.012 (with new servlet)</h3>
<p style="margin-left: 36.00pt;">Added ability to filter by individual columns to drilldowns.</p>
<p style="margin-left: 36.00pt;">Error messages are now displayed in a popup box.</p>
<p style="margin-left: 36.00pt;">Added tab groups as a new top layer. Tab groups contain Tabs and Tabs contain Analytics. Tabs that are not within the selected Tab group are hidden.</p>
<p style="margin-left: 36.00pt;">Resized title bar and moved tab group bar into the title bar.</p>
<p style="margin-left: 36.00pt;">Consolidated all buttons in the title bar into 2 buttons, ‘Save’ and ‘Menu’. ’ Save’ functionality has not changed. ‘Menu’ opens a context menu that contains the options for modifying and using DBAnalytics. (Add Tab group, Add Tab, Settings, etc.)</p>
<p style="margin-left: 36.00pt;">Changed the method to close a tab and tab group. Removed the x’s from the tab icon and created options ‘Delete Tab’ and Delete Tab Group’ to the menu. The options delete the currently selected tab or tab group.</p>
<p style="margin-left: 36.00pt;">Changed the method to rename a tab and tab group. Double clicking on a tab no longer works. The options ‘Rename Tab’ and ‘Rename Tab Group’ now provide renaming functionality.</p>
<p style="margin-left: 36.00pt;">Fixed the ability to have multiple layers of tabs. Tab groups can only have 1 layer.</p>
<p style="margin-left: 36.00pt;">Added the ability to drag Tabs between Tab groups. Analytics cannot be dragged between different Tab groups, though the tabs they are on can be moved.</p>
<p style="margin-left: 36.00pt;">Added an ‘All’ and a ‘LastXXDays’ option to the @DateOption@ property. ‘All’ shows all entries between 01-01-1900 and 12-31-2999. ‘LastXXDays’ shows the entries for the last XX days, where XX is a number (example: Last30Days).</p>
<p style="margin-left: 36.00pt;">Added a new method of retrieving files saved in the SAMPro archive. The user sees two links ‘Retrieve’ and ‘View’. ‘View’ is greyed out until the user hits ‘Retrieve’ and the file is copied. At that point, ‘View’ becomes valid and becomes a link to the document.</p>
<p style="margin-left: 36.00pt;">Fixed bug where the maximize button for an analytic did not align the fullscreen analytic with the screen.</p>
<p style="margin-left: 36.00pt;">Fixed inconsistencies involving title and subtitle not being replaced when an individual analytic was reset to defaults.</p>
<p style="margin-left: 36.00pt;">Added Help option in the menu that links to a skeleton Web Help that will be fleshed out in the future.</p>
<h3>Release 0.8+ (see separate customer notes)</h3>
<p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">&#160;</p>
<h2>22.2 KPI Definition</h2>
<h3>Purpose:</h3>
<p>KPI (Key Performance Indicator) records are used to define the individual Analytics in the DB Analytics Dashboard.</p>
<p>KPI records will be provided by Data-Basics; contact your support representative for additional information. In most cases, users should NEVER change KPI Definition records.</p>
<h3>Usage:</h3>
<p>The successful evaluation of KPI’s for the DB Analytics Dashboard depends upon the correct setting of the Category field your GL Account Type records. See user release note 6.1 for details.</p>
<p>GL Reporting Periods should be created through the end of the current and following year.</p>
<p>The Start KPI Definition function may be used to import the KPIs (stored as .obj files) into your database. During the import, each true analytic (Generic Charts/Tables) will have a User Defined Function created for it so that they can be assigned to the appropriate User Groups and Functions record. <font style="font-weight: bold;">When KPI’s are initially imported, they will only be available to User Group All; access rights to other User Groups should be made as needed.</font></p>
<h2>22.3 Start KPI Definition Import</h2>
<h3>Purpose:</h3>
<p>This function is used to import the KPIs (stored as .obj files) into your database. These files should be located in a subdirectory named KPIs located within the directory containing your SAMPro executable.</p>
<h3>Usage:</h3>
<p>Make sure that the KPI’s that you important are the correct, up-to-date ones provided by Data-Basics. This function will update existing KPI’s within your database. The <a href="Start_KPI_Definition_Export.htm">Start KPI Definition Export</a> function may be used to export existing KPI’s before importing new ones.</p>
<h3>Important Fields:</h3>
<h3>Range Screen:</h3>
<p><font style="font-weight: bold;">Directory:<br /></font>By default, this field will be set to a directory named KPIs located within the directory containing your SAMPro executable. If your files are located in a different location it should be specified before clicking the Go button.</p>
<h3>Checklist Screen:</h3>
<p>Check the Do box to select the KPI’s you wish to import. Click the Go button to import the selected KPI definitions.</p>
<h2>22.4 Start KPI Definition Export</h2>
<h3>Purpose:</h3>
<p>This function is used to export one or more KPIs in your database as object files. Typically, this would be done at the direction of your support representative to save existing KPI definitions before updating them with the Import function.</p>
<h2>22.5 Registry Entries</h2>

<p style="margin-left: 36.00pt;">Note: Most registry options defined in sys-dashboard may be overridden in the User Registry Tab by pre-pending the Key Value with Dashboard. For example:</p>

<h2>22.6 Calendar Date table</h2>
<h5>Purpose:</h5>
<p>This table was created for use with DB Analytics to simplify KPI definitions and reporting in general. This table is created and updated during data conversion to version 8.0 using the information in your GL Reporting Period records.&#160;&#160;After that, it is automatically updated by creating/editing GL Reporting Period records.</p>
<p style="margin-left: 36.00pt;"><font style="font-weight: bold;">GL Reporting Beginning Period:</font> If a ‘beginning’ period was established for loading data, the Start Date should be set to the beginning of the loading year, not the ‘blank’ date (01011900).</p>
<h5>Usage:</h5>
<p><font style="font-weight: bold;">The records in this viewer are managed by the system and should not be added or altered by the user directly.</font> One record is created for each day defined in a GL Reporting Period when the GL Reporting Period is added or save. The system calculates fields such as the fiscal year, day of the week and day of the month (long and short formats).</p>
<h5>Important Fields:</h5>
<p><font style="font-weight: bold;">Date Id:<br /></font> The Id for each record corresponds to the day in yyyy-mm-dd format.</p>
<p><font style="font-weight: bold;">Date:<br /></font>The Date in alphanumeric form.</p>
<p><font style="font-weight: bold;">Reporting Period Id: Description:<br /></font>These fields default from the GL Reporting Period this day is associated with.</p>
<p><font style="font-weight: bold;">Calendar Year: Calendar Quarter: Calendar Month: Calendar Week: Calendar Day:<br />
Day of Year: Day of Week: Period Title:<br /></font>These fields are calculated by the system based on the Start Date of the GL Reporting Period. The Day of the Week is calculated so that KPI’s that compare the current and previous year take the day of the week into consideration.</p>
<p><font style="font-weight: bold;">Fiscal Year: Fiscal Period: Report Title:<br /></font> The fields default from the GL Accounting Period associate with this record.</p>
<p><font style="font-weight: bold;">Day of Year:<br /></font> The day of the Fiscal year (calculated by the system, based on information in the GL Reporting Period).</p>
<p><font style="font-weight: bold;">Period First Day: Period Last Day:</font><font style="font-weight: bold;"><br /></font>The system uses the GL Reporting Period Start and End dates to determine if this date record should be flagged as a Period First or Last Day.</p>
<p><font style="font-weight: bold;">Year First Day: Year Last Day:<br /></font>The system used the GL Reporting Period to determine if this date record should be flagged as the fiscal Year First Day or fiscal Year Last Day.</p>
<h2>22.7 Start GL History Summary Rebuild&#160;</h2>
<p>In this release, Equity accounts are properly summarized within the equity-type sub-categories.</p>
<h5>Purpose:</h5>
<p>Start GL History Summary Rebuild is a starter-type function that completely reconstructs the contents of the GL History Summary.&#160;&#160;The GL History Summary table improves performance for the DB Analytics KPIs that need financial data currently stored in the GL History (glhstry) table.&#160;&#160;Essentially, this table contains a summarized version of the GL History.</p>
<h5>Usage:</h5>
<p>If DB Analytics is enabled on your system, a Schedule Event should be enabled to run Start GL History Summary Rebuild on a regular basis – ideally, at a light usage time when other backups are not running. This function has no input options which make it easy to schedule it for automated processing by the Scheduled Event Manager.</p>
<h1>23 Managers Dispatch Board</h1>
<h2>23.1 Managers Dispatch Board Overview</h2>
<p>The Managers Dispatch Board is included with DBAnalytics, but requires a slightly different set of implementation.</p>

<h2>24.1 Labor Journals Generated from TimeAnywhere</h2>
<p>In this release, the Description field in Labor Journal entries posted from TimeAnywhere is now blank. This change was made to prevent the description “TimeAnywhere Entry” from appearing in Construction Invoices for time recorded in TimeAnywhere.</p>
<h2>24.2 TimeAnywhere Post</h2>
<p>This release corrects a problem where the TimeAnywhere Post failed if checks had already been printed for the default PR Period.</p>

<h5>Accounts Payable</h5>
<p style="margin-left: 48px;"><span style="font-weight: bold;">AP Checks:</span> Previously, when EFT Checks which were voided during Post, they were incorrectly assigned a payment type of Check. The Check Type is now set to EFT.</p>
<h5 class="Support">General System</h5>
<p class="MsoNormal" style="margin-left: 48px;"><span style="font-weight: bold;">Canadian Users:</span> Corrects date-related errors that occurred if the Windows localization settings (which control the OS's date format) were for Canada. &#160;</p>

Report Payroll Worksheet (RPRWRKSv73b041 dated May 6, 2015)</span><br />
Revised reports include a Branch Id filter and support the Branch Hard Block logic. The report filters do not display the User's Branch filters but the Hard Block is handled by the reports. &#160;</p>
<p style="font-weight: bold; margin-left: 48px;">Void PR Check</p>
<p style="margin-left: 88px;">Corrects a problem with Job History reversals running under Security where the same Check number was used in both companies for two different GL accounts.</p>

<p style="margin-left: 48px;"><span style="font-weight: bold;">Approval Wizard:</span> &#160;The PO's General Tab requires a unique Description field. Previously, the Approval &#160;Wizard did not properly consolidate lines if they used different cases (e.g. Parts SENSOR &amp; Parts sensor), resulting in a failure to generate the PO. The system now evaluates the Quote's Material Tab Descriptions as lower case for consolidation purposes, but uses the first Description when writing to the PO record.</p>
<h5>Reporting (general)</h5>
<p style="margin-left: 48px;">Enabling the sys-ffv-global-settings option PreviewReportsAsPDF results in reports displaying as PDF's. To disable this functionality for individual reports see Release Note 2.3.7. &#160;</p>

<h2>8.0.510.053</h2>
<h5>Vendor History Report</h5>
<p style="margin-left: 48px;">A new range field, Invoice Date, has been added the system Report AP Vendor History. This range enables the user to filter data based on the Vendor Invoice Date.</p>
<h2>8.0.510.052</h2>
<h5>AP <span style="font-weight: bold;">Date to Pay / Select Invoices for Payment</span></h5>
<p style="margin-left: 48px;">Changing the Vendor Invoice # on AP Journal entries could result in incorrect amounts on the AP Check if Select Invoices for Payment was sitting open WHILE the AP Journal entry was being changed.

<h5>Shop Order Record Pick List</h5>
<p style="margin-left: 48px;">Empty reversing lines for GL History are no longer generated when a Shop Order Record Pick List entry generated for requisitioning is edited; these entries do not generate GL History in the first place.</p>
<h5><span style="font-weight: bold;">Work Order</span></h5>
<p style="font-weight: bold; margin-left: 48px;"><span style="font-weight: normal;">Corrects checking of serialized items so the WO can be set to Invoice Ready when all items are fully received and the registry option OkToBillWithOpenPOs is set to false.</span></p>

<p style="margin-left: 48px;"><b style="mso-bidi-font-weight: normal;">Work Order:</b> See Customer Release Note 2.12.3 for a registry entry to display RININV4 Invoices on the Work Order Invoices Tab.</p>
<h5><span style="font-weight: bold;">TechAnywhere</span></h5>
<p style="margin-left: 48px;">When the AutoPostCOD=False registry option is enabled (currently set for every TechAnywhere install), the TechAnywhere post should no longer erroneously create spurious Invoice, AR Sales, Cash Receipt records. This was the intent of this registry from the beginning.</p>

<p style="margin-left: 36.00pt;">Setting Key: locationid Setting Value: defaultlocationid</p>
<p style="margin-left: 36.00pt;">With the Setting Value blank, this option forces a blank location in the Approval Wizard, which the user must then complete. Note that the Location Id in the wizard is only used when generating a new work order - if you write to the lead work order, its location id is not changed.</p>
<p><font style="font-weight: bold;">Client Order</font><font style="font-weight: bold;">:</font> Corrects a problem in V8.0.510.025-028 where the Shipping address failed to populate from the Site record, and upon entering an inventory item, the inventory item pricing did not default in.</p>

<p style="margin-left: 36.00pt;">This release changes the posting code so that TechAnywhere-generated POs are created with Job Quantity Order and Job Quantity Received set to zero to correct recent inventory history issues</p>
<p style="margin-left: 36.00pt;">Corrects a problem where POs generated by TechAnywhere always used the first Equipment on the Work Order instead of the one the Technician actually selected.</p>

<p style="margin-left: 36.00pt;"><font style="font-weight: bold;">Work Order Inventory / GL:</font> This release changes the behavior when posting WO-INV entries to GL History.&#160;&#160;Previously, the GLH Credit never included a GL Entity.&#160;&#160;In this release, the system ALWAYS uses the GL Entity from the WO-INV line's Location record. Set the GL Entity in the Location record to ensure that the Credit GL Entity defaults properly when items are entered on the Work Order Inventory tab.</p>
<p style="margin-left: 36.00pt;"><font style="font-weight: bold;">Service Billing Worksheet:</font> a registry option may be used to allow the Service Billing Worksheet to be run when WO is not Invoice Ready. See customer release note 2.26.</p>
<p style="margin-left: 36.00pt;"><font style="font-weight: bold;">Start Renew Master Contracts:</font> Previously, running this function with Weighted and a zero percent increase selected could result in some of the new allocations being off by a few pennies. In this release, if an escalation percentage of 0 (zero) is selected, the Site’s amounts are not altered, only the dates.</p>
<p><font style="font-weight: bold;">Sub Anywhere:</font> When a PO General line is generated from SubAnywhere, the GL Account is only set from the ‘misc’ inventory group it the GL Account was empty.</p>
<p><font style="font-weight: bold;">TechAnywhere:</font></p>
<p style="margin-left: 36.00pt;">The latest DBXchange (4.040.04) is required for TechAnywhere Android, TechAnywhere Windows, and SubAnywhere to support the Archived document sub-folder functionality. Deploy this version of DBXchange before implementing document archive sub-folders.</p>
<p style="margin-left: 36.00pt;">Corrects a sporadic problem where status updates from TechAnywhere were lost if the Work Order was open in SAMPro when it was updated by TechAnywhere.</p>
<h2>8.0.510.016a</h2>
<p><font style="font-weight: bold;">Classic Board:</font> corrects issue in the previous release where status changes could not be saved.</p>

<p><font style="font-weight: bold;">Canadian T5018 Forms:</font> Changed formatting to match new form. No field changes. See user release note 2.23 for the registry settings required for this report.</p>
<p><font style="font-weight: bold;">Compute Corporate Metrics:</font> corrects missing column errors.</p>

<p><font style="font-weight: bold;">New Call (Web Logs):</font> This registry-enabled enhancement is designed for businesses where web logs created in CRMAnywhere are entered by company/franchise employees. When enabled, these web logs will be used to automatically generate work orders; it is NOT recommended for firms using CRMAnywhere to allow external clients generate web logs. See user note 12.13</p>
<p><font style="font-weight: bold;">Purchase Order IMH Tab:</font> Previously, this tab was sorted by Part/Description, Effective Date, and then Source Journal alphabetically.&#160;&#160;In this release, the Source Journal part is ordered by Purchase, then Receipts, and finally AP Journal vouchering to be more in tune with the way things normally happen.</p>
<p><font style="font-weight: bold;">Tech Anywhere:</font></p>
<p style="margin-left: 36.00pt;">This release fixes an issue where TechAnywhere New Work Order messages would sometimes post without making the work order. The posting of status changes messages is also improved: if a status changes message fails to update the status of a workorder, rather than sending an email, it will now log to the Sampro error.log.</p>
<p style="margin-left: 36.00pt;">Corrects a problem in recent releases where work orders generated from Tech Anywhere did not have their Workorder Status Category and Escalation status set correctly.</p>

<p><font style="font-weight: bold;">Job History:</font> Forwarding/reversing entries are now written to Job History when the Client Site Equipment Id is the only field changed in Work Order, Labor, and Job Journal detail lines.</p>
<p><font style="font-weight: bold;">Reports:</font></p>

<p style="margin-left: 36.00pt;">The Attachments button in New Call lets you attach documents to one or more of the scheduled events generated by this work order and the work order itself; a registry setting defines the Document Category of files that are eligible for attachment.&#160;&#160;A checklist of files will appear in the upper portion of the screen – click in the Attach column to select /deselect a file.&#160;&#160;In previous releases, the grayed-out Attachments button was always displayed,&#160;even if Attachments were available.
