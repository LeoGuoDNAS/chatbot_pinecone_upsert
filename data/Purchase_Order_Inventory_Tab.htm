<h1>Purchase Order Inventory Tab</h1>
<p><font style="font-weight: bold;">Lines Imported to Work Order<br/>
</font>A warning will appear if you attempt to delete, cancel or change 
 the quantities of a line that has already been imported into a work order.</p>
<p>If the No Inventory? box is checked 
 in the Vendor&#39;s record, users are prevented from selecting Inventory Items 
 in this Purchase Order. <span style="font-weight: bold;"> </span></p>
<h2>Important Fields:</h2>
<p><font style="font-weight: bold;">Qty Ordered:<br/>
</font> The quantity of the item being ordered. This field cannot be changed 
 if the status is Pending Cancel or Cancelled. It cannot be changed to 
 less than the quantity already received.</p>
<p><font style="font-weight: bold;">QtyRcvd:</font><br/>
It is recommended that items are received via the Inventory Receipts Journal. 
  However, if this Purchase Order is being issued to record a transaction 
 that has already taken place,  you may enter the quantity that was 
 already received. Serial and Lot-Controlled items may <font style="font-weight: bold;">not</font> 
 be received in a PO line, only in the Inventory Receipts Journal.</p>
<p style="margin-left: 48px;"><font style="font-weight: bold;">Note:</font> 
 if Unvouchered Payables are implemented on your system, the Unvouchered 
 Payable GL accounts must be entered in all applicable Inventory Group 
 records.</p>
<p class="Reference_Line" style="margin-left: 36.00pt; margin-bottom: 0.00pt;"><font style="font-weight: bold;">Note:</font> this field may default in 
 if specified in the <a href="Registry_Entry_Purchase_Order.htm">Registry 
 Entry for Purchase Orders</a> . This option may be disabled on a vendor-specific 
 basis by checking the Disable PO AutoFill box in the Vendor record’s Contacts 
 Tab. Alternately, a registry may be enabled 
 to <a href="Registry_Entry_Purchase_Order.htm#Auto_Receive_Credit_PO">Auto 
 Receive Credit POs</a> only. </p>
<p><font style="font-weight: bold;">Inventory Item Id:<br/>
<span style="font-weight: normal;">Enter the part number or d</span></font>ouble-click 
 on this field to select from a list of items.  The entry of an inactive 
 item (where the Inactive box is flagged) is disallowed. If a part has 
 been superceded (the Superceded By field on the Inventory Other Tab is 
 filled in). When a superseded part number is entered into this field, 
 the system will alert the user that</p>
<p style="margin-left: 36.00pt;">Item A has been superceded by Item B. 
 Use New Item?</p>
<p>It the user clicks Yes, the new part (B) will be returned to the field. 
 If the user clicks No, part A (which has been superceded) will remain 
 in the field.</p>
<p>This field cannot be modified if the Purchase Order Status is Printed, 
 Changed, Pending Cancelled, or Cancelled.</p>
<p><font style="font-weight: bold;">Unit Cost:</font><br/>
For Items NOT flagged as Miscellaneous, this field defaults from the Inventory 
 Vendor tab for the selected Vendor, if available, and the Last Cost if 
 this item has not been purchased from this Vendor before. It specifies 
 the Unit Cost of the item at the time of order. If the Item is flagged 
 as Miscellaneous, the Unit Cost will not default and must be entered at 
 the time the Item is ordered. If the Currency Id field is completed on 
 the Main Tab, all costs MUST be entered in the Vendor’s currency.</p>
<p style="margin-left: 36.00pt;"><span style="font-weight: bold;">Vendor 
 Price:</span> Creating a Purchase Order will set the Price on the Inventory 
 Item&#39;s Vendor tab. For this reason, it is vital to verify pricing when 
 creating purchase orders.</p>
<p><font style="font-weight: bold;">Extended Cost:</font><br/>
The Unit Cost X Qty. This field is calculated by the system when you enter 
 the Quantity and the Unit Cost. You may enter the Extended Cost and press 
 Enter to have the system calculate the Unit Cost for you.</p>
<p><font style="font-weight: bold;">WO Id:</font><br/>
This field defaults from the WO Id on the Main PO tab. If a WO Id is filled 
 in, the Job, Cost Code, and Billing Item field will default. A Purchase 
 Order may be imported into a Work Order by clicking the Import Cost button 
 on the Work Order. If this field is completed, it will be referenced on 
 the printed PO.</p>
<p><font style="font-weight: bold;">Equipment Id:<br/>
</font>If the user enters a Work Order Id, the system will default in the 
 first piece of equipment on the Work Order’s Equipment tab UNLESS this 
 behavior is disabled via registry (see <a href="Registry_Entry_Global_Settings__Column_Compression__Dispatch_Board_Rows__History_Log_Inventory_Markup.htm#global_settings_journal_equipment_id">Registry 
 Option - Do Not Default Equipment Id</a>). If the user double clicks on 
 this field, the system will display a list of all equipment associated 
 with the Client Site referenced in the Work Order.</p>
<p>If the sys-ffv-global setting &#39;DefaultEquipmentFromWorkorder&#39; is set 
 to false, the user is allowed to set the Equipment Id back to blank. If 
 this registry option is not present or set to true, the Equipment Id must 
 be completed if a Work Order Id is referenced.</p>
<p><font style="font-weight: bold;">Job Id:</font><br/>
The Job (if any) this item is being ordered for; this field defaults from 
 the Job Id on the Main PO tab (if completed). This field will also default 
 if the WO Id is completed.</p>
<p><font style="font-weight: bold;">Job Cost Code Id:</font>  <font style="font-weight: bold;">Job Bill Itm Id:</font>  <font style="font-weight: bold;">Job 
 Cost Category:</font><br/>
If a Job Id is specified, these fields must be filled in with the appropriate 
 Job Cost Category, Job Cost Code, and Billing Item Id&#39;s. The 
 Job Cost Category will be cleared if a Job is NOT specified when the record 
 is saved or loaded.</p>
<p>The Cost Category supports enhanced 
 filtering provided by the Cost Code&#39;s Job Cost Category Usage Filter. 
 Cost Categories are validated (relative to Cost Codes) during data entry 
 upon leaving the Cost Category Id field.  The full relationship is 
 validated again when leaving a child line or saving a record.</p>
<p>Cost Category Selection Types of Material, 
 Other or Equipment are allow.  The user will be warned if Material 
 or Labor is selected.</p>
<p><font style="font-weight: bold;">Job Qty: Job Qty Rcvd:<br/>
</font>If you have entered a Job Id or Work Order Id on the Purchase Order 
 header or on this line, these fields will default from the Qty and Qty 
 Rcvd fields. However, if this is a TechAnywhere-generated Purchase Orders, 
 these fields do not default when the Quantity Ordered/Received is changed 
 to prevent double-costing; they should remain at zero.</p>
<p>The Job Qty and Job Qty Rcvd fields may be decreased if you want only 
 some of this item to be bought to the Job; the remainder will be assigned 
 to inventory. The Job Qty <font style="text-decoration: underline; ">cannot</font> 
 be set to zero if the line contains either a WO Id or a Job Id.</p>
<p><font style="font-weight: bold;">Job Accnt:<br/>
</font>If a Job is selected, this display-only field defaults from the 
 Cost Category’s GL Expense field. If the Job Qty exceeds zero, the Job 
 Accnt must be completed.</p>
<p><font style="font-weight: bold;">Job</font> <font style="font-weight: bold;">Entity:<br/>
</font>This GL Entity defaults from the Job Cost Code record, if the Entity 
 is specified.</p>
<p><font style="font-weight: bold;">Invntry Accnt:<br/>
</font>This display-only field defaults from the item’s Inventory Group 
 record (the GL Inventory Asset Account field). This field pertains to 
 items that are being purchased to inventory.</p>
<p><font style="font-weight: bold;">Invntry Entity:<br/>
</font>This display-only field pertains to items that are being purchased 
 to inventory. It defaults from the GL Entity in the item’s Inventory Group 
 record (if completed). If the Entity is not completed in the Inventory 
 Group, the Inventory Entity will default from the Location record (if 
 it is completed there).</p>
<p><font style="font-weight: bold;">Description:</font><br/>
This field defaults from the Name field in the Inventory Item record. If 
 you change this field the system will automatically update the Description 
 field in the Inventory Item record&#39;s Vendor tab.</p>
<p>If the Item is flagged as Miscellaneous, the Description will not default 
 and must be entered at the time the Item is ordered.</p>
<p><font style="font-weight: bold;">Vendor&#39;s Part #:</font><br/>
If completed, this number will be included on your printed Purchase Order. 
 If you have previously ordered this part number from this vendor, or directly 
 changed it on the Inventory Item Vendor tab, this cross reference information 
 will be filled in when you enter your Inventory Item Id. If you change 
 or add the Vendor&#39;s Part #, the system will automatically update the cross 
 reference information in the Inventory Item record&#39;s Vendor tab.</p>
<p><font style="font-weight: bold;">U-M:</font><br/>
Defaults from the Inventory Item record but may be modified by the user 
 if required.</p>
<p><font style="font-weight: bold;">Date Requested:</font><br/>
The date you are requesting the item; defaults from the corresponding field 
 in the header section of the PO when the Quantity field is completed.</p>
<p><font style="font-weight: bold;">Date Promised:</font><br/>
The date the Vendor promised the item; defaults from the corresponding 
 field in the header section of the PO when the Quantity field is completed.</p>
<p><font style="font-weight: bold;">Cancel?</font><br/>
Flag this field if this item is to be cancelled. This line cannot be cancelled 
 if items have been received, if the line status is New, or the PO has 
 a status of Cancelled or Closed.</p>
<p>If the PO has a status of printed, and you need to change the quantity 
 or Inventory Id on a line, you must do the following:</p>
<p style="margin-left: 48px;">Un-receive the line if it has been received<br/>
Flag the line you want to change as Canceled<br/>
Add the line that will replace it<br/>
Say yes to make it a change order when you save it.</p>
<p><img src="assets/images/image/Magnify.gif" alt="" style="border: none;" border="0"/> 
 Double-click the Magnify button to display the following fields for this 
 line.</p>
<p class="Reference_Line" style="margin-bottom: 0.00pt;"><img src="assets/images/image/LinesView.gif" alt="" style="border: none;" border="0"/>  Click the Lines View 
 button to display the multiple line view again.</p>
<p class="Reference_Line" style="margin-bottom: 0.00pt;"><span style="font-weight: bold;">Billable Quantity:</span><br/>
This field supports the scenario where a TechAnywhere technician changes 
 the Billable Quantity of an item so that it will be correctly imported 
 into the Work Order. By default this field is set from the Job Quantity 
 Ordered.  </p>
<p style="margin-left: 8px;"><font style="font-weight: bold;">Extended 
 Description:</font><br/>
This field defaults from the Extended PO Description field in the Inventory 
 Item record but may be modified by the user for this PO. <span style="font-weight: bold;">By 
 default, when the PO is saved, the contents of this field is copied to 
 the corresponding Inventory Item&#39;s Purchase Order Description field on 
 the PO Description tab.</span> For some customers this is an undesirable 
 behavior; a <a href="Registry_Entry_Purchase_Order.htm">registry</a> is 
 available to <span style="font-weight: bold;">override</span> this default 
 behavior:</p>
<p style="margin-left: 8px;"><span style="font-weight: bold;">Extra:</span><br/>
If the Job Billing Item on this line is Fixed Fee / Allow Extras, this 
 box must be checked to enable the calculation of the Amount Revenue field.</p>
<p><font style="font-weight: bold;">Billing Type Id:  Revenue Rate:</font><br/>
These fields will be completed if this line pertains to a Work Order or 
 Job, and are jointly determined by the Inventory Item and the Job&#39;s Rate 
 Schedule, but may be changed if needed. These fields determine how the 
 Unit Price will be calculated to be charged to the customer:</p>
<p style="margin-left: 36.00pt;">For Use Unit Price Inventory Items, the 
 Billing Type Id defaults to <font style="font-weight: bold;">Unit Price.</font> 
  The system will use the Unit Price in the Inventory record that 
 corresponds to the Job&#39;s Material Price Level to set the Revenue Rate.</p>
<p style="margin-left: 36.00pt;">If the Inventory Item is not flagged as 
 Use Unit Price, the Billing Type Id <font style="font-weight: bold;">Markup</font> 
 will default, and the Revenue Rate from the Material Markup table specified 
 in the Rate Schedule for this Job. A 120% markup applied to an item costing 
 $100 would generate a unit price of $220. A 30% markup applied to an item 
 costing $100 would generate a unit price of $130.</p>
<p><font style="font-weight: bold;">Unit Price:</font><br/>
The Unit Price for this inventory item, based on the Unit Cost, Bill Type 
 Id, and Revenue rate.</p>
<p><font style="font-weight: bold;">Amount Revenue:</font><br/>

 (Unit Price x Quantity), less any applicable discounts. This field will 
 be set when the Job Quantity Received is completed (not equal to zero).</p>

 Group Id:  </font><span style="font-weight: bold;">Tax Cost:</span> 
 <span style="font-weight: bold;"><font style="font-weight: bold;">T</font>ax 
 Type Id:</span><span style="font-weight: bold;"><br/>
</span>The Tax Group Id  field will default from the Tax Group Id 
 on the Purchase Order’s Main tab (if it is completed). If the Tax Group 
 Id is not set on the Main tab, this field will default from the Job record 
 (if specified). The Tax Group specified in this field is used to calculate 
 the use tax cost for items entered on this tab.</p>
<p class="Reference_Line" style="margin-bottom: 0.00pt;"><span style="font-weight: bold;">Job 
 Tax Status:</span><br/>
