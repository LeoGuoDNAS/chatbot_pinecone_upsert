<h1>Version 9.0 Customer Release Notes</h1>
<h2>9.0.572.060 (2020-03-09)</h2>
<p style="font-weight: bold; margin-left: 48px;">IMPORTANT: Avalara Users<br />
<span style="font-weight: normal;">Formatting configurations within the Avalara import files for certain states may require manual updates to Sales Tax Authorities/Groups following the update. Please contact your support rep before running Start Sales Tax Update (Avalara).</span> <span style="font-weight: normal;">Note that new releases of Version 9.1 support the Avalara Web Service (which does not have these import issues). Upgrading to Version 9.1 also provides preprocessing information on anomalies in the Avalara import files which may need to be corrected.</span> &#160;</p>
<p style="font-weight: bold; margin-left: 8px;"><span style="font-weight: normal;">Click to go to</span> <a href="#Recent_Updates">Recent Updates</a>.</p>
<h3>WARNING:</h3>
<p style="margin-left: 48px;"><span style="font-weight: bold;">DO NOT UPGRADE</span> any QuoteMaster system without checking / correcting the data first; this <span style="font-weight: bold;">MUST</span> be done by a Data-Basics Support Rep. &#160;Failure to do so may result in failure of the conversion and the loss of the database. &#160;See the <a href="9.0_Upgrade_Notes.htm">9.0 Upgrade Notes</a> for detailed information.</p>
<h1>1 &#160;System</h1>
<h2>1.1 System Registries</h2>
<h3>1.1.0 &#160;Registry Viewer</h3>
<p><img src="SKIN1_SortLines.bmp" alt="" style="border: none;" border="0" /> &#160;Due to the need to maintain certain Registry records in a specific order the Registry's lower pane is no longer sorted automatically when it is saved. Instead, the new Sort Lines button allows the user to resort individual registry entries alphabetically.</p>
<p>To do so:</p>
<p>1. Complete any needed changes to the Registry record.</p>
<p>2. Save (or Add) the Registry record.</p>
<p>3. Click the Sort Lines button.</p>
<p>4. Save the record again to retain the new Sort Order.</p>
<p style="margin-left: 48px;"><span style="font-weight: bold;">Important:</span> The Registry viewer does NOT warn the user about losing unsaved changes if all the user did to a record is push the new SortLines button. &#160;</p>
<h3>1.1.1 Pending Changes Handling</h3>
<p style="margin-left: 8px;">By default in this release, if user A changes a field and then tabs out of it, a Pending Changes flag is set in the Record Change Log. The following registry should be used to change the pending changes message (see Customer Note 1.3.2) from an error to a warning, or to disable it altogether if record lock issues are encountered.</p>
<p style="margin-left: 8px;"><span style="font-weight: bold;">Registry Id:</span> sys-ffv-global-settings</p>
<p style="margin-left: 8px;"><span style="font-weight: bold;">Setting Key:</span> NotifyPendingChanges &#160;&#160;&#160;<span style="font-weight: bold;">Setting Value:</span> warning OR none (default error)</p>
<p style="margin-left: 8px;">If this entry is absent or set to error, if user B attempts to change a record currently being changed by user A, he will be prevented from doing so, and a message will be displayed.</p>
<p style="margin-left: 8px;">If the Setting Value of warning is selected, and user B accesses/changes a record which user A has started to edit, the following message will be displayed, but user B will be allowed to make changes:</p>
<p style="margin-left: 48px;">WARNING: this record is currently being changed by another user.<br />
User <span style="font-style: italic;"><i>userid</i></span> started making changes to this record at <span style="font-style: italic;"><i>date - time</i></span>.</p>
<p style="margin-left: 8px;">If the Setting Value of none is selected, the Pending Changes flag is never written to the Record Change Log, and this functionality is completely disabled.</p>
<h3>1.1.2 Required and Disabled Fields Options Support Multiple Lines</h3>
<p>The RequiredFields and DisabledFields registries did not allow some of our users tag enough fields as required or disabled due to long field names and the character limit of the Setting Value. This release extends multiple registry line support to the RequiredFieldsParent, RequiredFields<span style="font-style: italic;"><i>child</i></span>, DisabledFieldsParent, and DisabledFields<span style="font-style: italic;"><i>child</i></span> Setting Keys.</p>
<p style="margin-left: 48px; text-decoration: underline;">Example:Client Site</p>
<p style="margin-left: 48px;">Id: sys-viewer-vclntste</p>
<p style="margin-left: 48px;">Setting Key: RequiredFieldsParent &#160;Setting Value: jb.lcl: txathrty.id,rteschdle.id</p>
<p style="margin-left: 48px;">Setting Key: RequiredFieldsParent &#160;Setting Value: jb.gl-ar: glaccnt.id</p>
<p style="margin-left: 48px;">…. And additional lines as needed</p>
<h3><span style="font-weight: bold;">1.1.3 Disabled Fields Registry for First Field</span></h3>
<p style="margin-left: 8px;">In this release, if the first tab order field is disabled, the caret will be positioned in the next field, and the disabled field will correctly display as disabled.</p>
<h3>1.1.4 Default Email Sender Registry</h3>
<p style="margin-left: 8px;">If a From address cannot be determined, an Email cannot be sent. Especially in the case of emailing as a PDF, the XML will contain a blank emailFrom tag and the email will fail silently in the xmlToPdf_Failed folder. This release provides several enhancements to prevent Emails from attempting to send without a from address.</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: bold;">Id:</span> sys-email</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: bold;">Setting Key:</span> DefaultEmailSender &#160;<span style="font-weight: bold;">Setting Value:</span> <span style="font-style: italic;"><i>validemailaddress</i></span></p>
<p>If a 'From' email address cannot be determined from the User's Contact Record (for reports) or the Notification Category (for Scheduled Events), this email address will be used instead.</p>
<p>Reports:</p>
<p style="margin-left: 48px;">1. When clicking the email button on a report (if UseOutlook=false), the Sender field is now required on the SAMPro Email screen. If the Email address is not completed in the User's Contact record, the Sender field will default from the sys-email registry's DefaultEmailSender option.</p>
<p style="margin-left: 48px;">2. The Email From field in the Schedule Report screen is now required. If the Email address is not completed in the User's Contact record, the Email From field will default from the sys-mail registry's DefaultEmailSender option.</p>
<p style="margin-left: 8px;">Scheduled Events: If the email-from is not set by the Scheduled Event Manager, the default email sender from &#160;the sys-email registry will be used.</p>
<p>Dispatch Board: When UseOutlook is enabled via registry, clicking the Email button launches the Outlook form and sets the Email To field with the Tech’s Email Address 2.</p>
<h3>1.1.5 Security Overrides Global Restrictions</h3>
<p>This registry allows the user to set restrictions for a security(ies) to be hidden as a global registry. User specific registries (sys-security-overrides-<span style="font-style: italic;"><i>branchid-userid</i></span> or sys-security-overrides--<span style="font-style: italic;"><i>userid</i></span>) would then be enabled (without the block or sql options) to allow specific users access to the blocked security(ies).</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: bold;">Id:</span> sys-security-overrides</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: bold;">Setting Key:</span> blocked &#160;<span style="font-weight: bold;">Setting Value:</span> List of Security Id's that cannot be accessed</p>
<p style="margin-left: 48px;">Example: To Block Records with Security Id 01 and 02:</p>
<p style="margin-left: 48px;">Setting Key: blocked &#160;&#160;&#160;Setting Value: 01,02</p>
<p>OR</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: bold;">Id:</span> sys-security-overrides</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: bold;">Setting Key:</span> sql &#160;&#160;<span style="font-weight: bold;">Setting Value:</span> sql snippet</p>
<p>This option incorporates a standard sql snippet into the standard security filtering. Only column names from the Security (scrty) table may be referenced.</p>
<p style="margin-left: 48px;">Example: Records with Security Id's that begin with 0 cannot be accessed:</p>
<p style="margin-left: 8px;">Setting Key: sql &#160;&#160;Setting Value: scrty_id not like '0%'<br /></p>
<h2>1.2 Reports</h2>
<p style="margin-left: 8px;">Most Report Range fields have been expanded from 999 to 1999 characters.</p>
<p style="margin-left: 8px;">Corrects an error in recent versions which occurred when the 'Hold Open' button was not selected when running a Drilldown report.</p>
<p style="margin-left: 8px;">Performance enhancement when overwriting an existing report file when it is auto-saved.</p>
<h3>1.2.1 Printer Registries&#160;(sys-printer-<span style="font-style: italic;"><i>reportid</i></span>)</h3>
<p>Previously, if a 'sys-printer-XXX' entry existed for a report function (e.g., setting the COP Invoice to Portrait), the report always printed to the user's default printer. In this release, the printer dialog box will appear unless the appropriate 'defaultprinter' option exists in the registry.</p>
<h5>1.2.1a Default Printer</h5>
<p>This release corrects an issue where the defaultprinter option in the sys-printer-functionid registry was ignored. If this registry is enabled the report will once again be sent directly to the specified printer without a dialog box being displayed.</p>
<h3>1.2.2 DBR Report Files and Bitmaps</h3>
<p>Although deprecated, the 'at' and 'size' attributes are still implemented by some users in their report registry entries. This release restores this functionality inadvertently removed in v 9.0.572.037e.</p>
<p>This release enhances the logic used to find a bitmap logo to display on a saved SAMPro (.dbr format) report if the bitmap is not found in the original location (e.g., after a server move).</p>
<p>Any time a DBR is saved, it stores the registry values in the DBR file itself. Namely, the bitmap directory. When that DBR file is opened in SAMPro, it will recall the old bitmap directory to go out and find the logo to print to screen.<br />
In the event of a server move, that bitmap folder may no longer exist. Especially in the case of using UNC file paths (Ex. \\SERVER1\Share\ -&gt; \\SERVER2\Share\ -OR- \\SERVER1\Share\ -&gt; S:\).</p>
<p>SAMPro will now use the following steps to find a bitmap logo to display on the report:<br />
1) Look in the DBR file for the old bitmaps directory.<br />
-- If not found --<br />
2) Look in the sys-report-*** registry for a 'bitmaps' setting.<br />
-- If not found --<br />
3) Look in the \bitmaps directory in the SAMPro root folder</p>
<p>\bitmaps or \Bitmaps will work. The filename it is looking for here is the filename stored in the bitmaps setting</p>
<p style="margin-left: 48px;"><span style="text-decoration: underline;"><u>Example:</u></span> &#160;S:\docs\bitmaps\quotes\<strong>quote1.bmp</strong> -&gt; S:\SAMPro\bitmaps\<strong>quote1.bmp</strong></p>
<h3>1.2.3 Registry to Skip Printer Prompt and Always Print to User's Default Printer</h3>
<p>The following registry may be implemented to save the user time and clicks by eliminating the printer prompt and always selecting the user's default printer.</p>
<p style="margin-left: 48px;"><span style="font-weight: bold;">Important:</span> This registry should be implemented with caution as users will NOT have the option of selecting a different printer when running the report. It is most appropriate for reports which will only be displayed or always be printed to the user's default printer.</p>
<p style="margin-left: 8px;"><span style="font-weight: bold;">Id:</span> sys-report-<span style="font-style: italic;"><i>reportfunctionid &#160;(if the report does not require a starter function)</i></span></p>
<p style="margin-left: 8px;"><span style="font-weight: bold;">Id:</span> sys-start-ssrvcebllngwrksht &#160;<span style="font-style: italic;"><i>(to implement for the service billing worksheet)</i></span></p>
<p style="margin-left: 8px;"><span style="font-weight: bold;">Setting Key:</span> UseDefaultPrinter &#160;&#160;<span style="font-weight: bold;">Setting Value:</span> true &#160;(default is false)</p>
<p style="margin-left: 8px;">Note that this setting trumps a similar registry in the 'old dialog' setting.</p>
<p style="margin-left: 8px;">See Customer Note 16.1.15 for a registry to also skip the Service Billing Worksheet's checklist.</p>
<h3><span style="font-weight: bold;">1.2.4 Emailing Reports</span></h3>
<p style="margin-left: 8px;">This release corrects a Runtime error when UseOutlook and CopyAll are both enabled in the sys-email registry AND the user sends a report as a .cvs or .txt file from Outlook.</p>
<p style="margin-left: 8px;">The Email viewer which appears when e-mailing a report from SAMPro now supports an expanded Message field of 1200 characters. This allows the entire contents of a Common phase to be included in the Message. &#160;</p>
<h3>1.2.5 Scheduled Reports</h3>
<p style="margin-left: 8px;">Previously, installing a revised report record for a scheduled report could result in prompting messages and 'key is missing' errors; it was sometimes necessary to recreate the schedule report. These issues are now corrected so that the revised scheduled report runs properly.</p>
<h3>1.2.6 Global Registry to Enable Windows Printer Dialog</h3>
<p><span style="font-weight: bold;">Id:</span> sys-ffv-global-settings</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: bold;">Setting Key:</span> OldPrinterDialog &#160;&#160;&#160;<span style="font-weight: bold;">Setting Value:</span> true &#160;&#160;&#160;(default false)</p>
<p>Enabling this setting will display the Windows (OldPrinterDialog screen instead of SAMPro's Printer List when printing a report. This allows the use to select a different paper tray and other functions not supported on the SAMPro printer list.</p>
<p>This may be disabled on a function by function basis by the following:</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: bold;">Id:</span> sys-printer-dialog-<span style="font-style: italic;"><i>funtionid</i></span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: bold;">Setting Key:</span> olddialog &#160;&#160;<span style="font-weight: bold;">Setting Value:</span> false</p>
<p>The system handles existing local report registry oldDialog='' as oldDialog = true to preserve old-style registry settings turning on this functionality.</p>
<p style="margin-left: 48px;">Note:<br />
When OldPrinterDialog/Olddialog is enabled, the From - To Pages settings in the Report viewer are NOT carried &#160;to the Second Windows printer box where it must be set. To print only a few pages of a report, the page number must be entered in the Windows Dialog.</p>
<h3>1.2.7 Generic Text Printer File: Start Move Generic Documents (new function)</h3>
<p>Some users 'print' to a generic text printer; this may generate a file with NO FILENNAME EXTENSION instead of paper. In some cases, the file is written to the directory containing the SAMPro executable which clutters up the folder. &#160;<span style="font-weight: bold;">In this function, 'generic document' refers to these files, not SAMPro Document records. &#160;In this function, 'generic document' refers to these files, not SAMPro Document records.</span></p>
<p>If the following registry entry exists, this new function will move all files with no filename extension from the SAMPro base directory to the DestinationDirectory specified in the registry. If this registry does not exist, running the function will have no impact on your files. This function designed to be run 'headless' so that it can be scheduled to run as a scheduled event.</p>
<p>If there is an exception list of files in the registry these files will not be moved. If the file already exists in the DestinationDirectory then a count will be added to the file name before it is stored. Special Characters in File names will be replaced by UnderScore before file is moved.</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: bold;">Id:</span> sys-start-smvegnrcdcmnts</p>
<h5><span style="font-weight: bold;">Specify the Destination Directory</span></h5>
<p><span style="font-weight: bold;">Setting Key:</span> DestinationDirectory &#160;&#160;<span style="font-weight: bold;">Setting Value:</span> <span style="font-style: italic;"><i>PathToDestinationDirectory</i></span></p>
<p><span style="font-style: italic;"><i>The Setting Value should provide the full path an existing directory.</i></span> Start Move Generic Documents will move files with no Filename Extention from the base SAMPro directory to the folder define in this option.</p>
<h5><span style="font-weight: bold;">Specify Files to Excluded from the Move (required)</span></h5>
<p><span style="font-weight: bold;">Setting Key:</span> FileExceptions &#160;&#160;Setting Value: <span style="font-style: italic;"><i>ListOfFilesToIgnore</i></span></p>
<p>Some files with no filename extension are used by SAMPro and should be excluded from the move. At this point, LabelRemap and inetlog should be excluded. It is possible that other should also be excluded.</p>
<p style="margin-left: 48px;">Example:</p>
<p style="margin-left: 48px;"><span style="font-weight: bold;">Setting Key:</span> FileExceptions &#160;&#160;<span style="font-weight: bold;">Setting Value:</span> LabelRemap,inetlog</p>
<h3>1.2.8 Start Report Import</h3>
<p>SAMPro's User Defined Reports share field definitions. Importing an older report (with a smaller field size) will reduce the field size for all reports that use it in the database; this can result in other reports throwing errors. In this release, the user is alerted when a field being imported is smaller than that found in the database (unless the global registry setting ReportImportReportFields=Keep is enabled).</p>
<p>Field size comparisons are calculated as follows:</p>
<p>Decimal fields (Precision - Scale) for both fields<br style="color: #000000; font-family: Verdana, 'Helvetica Neue', Helvetica, Arial, sans-serif; font-size: 14px; font-style: normal; font-variant-ligatures: normal; font-variant-caps: normal; font-weight: 400; letter-spacing: normal; orphans: 2; text-align: start; text-indent: 0px; text-transform: none; white-space: normal; widows: 2; word-spacing: 0px; -webkit-text-stroke-width: 0px; text-decoration-style: initial; text-decoration-color: initial;" />
Textbox fields (Precision * Scale) for both fields<br style="margin-bottom: 0px; color: #000000; font-family: Verdana, 'Helvetica Neue', Helvetica, Arial, sans-serif; font-size: 14px; font-style: normal; font-variant-ligatures: normal; font-variant-caps: normal; font-weight: 400; letter-spacing: normal; orphans: 2; text-align: start; text-indent: 0px; text-transform: none; white-space: normal; widows: 2; word-spacing: 0px; -webkit-text-stroke-width: 0px; text-decoration-style: initial; text-decoration-color: initial;" />
All other types of fields compare only the Precision.</p>
<p>If the report field definition being imported is smaller that the corresponding report field in the database, the following message will be displayed:</p>
<p style="margin-left: 48px;">The Field Id: xxxxx now in your database for Report: yyyyyyy</p>
<p style="margin-left: 48px;">has Field Size: 15 greater than the report you are importing with Field Size: 10</p>
<p style="margin-left: 48px;">Do you want to import the smaller field&#160;&#160;(not recommended)?</p>
<p>We recommend selecting 'No' if this message appears. &#160;Please take a screen capture of this message if it appears, and contact Support with this information so that the problem with the report can be corrected.</p>
<h2>1.3 Viewers (General)</h2>
<p style="margin-left: 0px;">This release corrects sporadic errors encountered when clicking the End key and then editing an Id field that already contains the maximum number of characters.</p>
<p style="margin-left: 0px;"><img src="image/SKIN1_Notes.gif" alt="" style="border: none;" border="0" /> The Notes button displays the blank Note icon if only Obsoleted notes (or no notes) are attached.</p>
<p style="margin-left: 0px;"><span style="font-weight: bold;">Windows Time Formats:</span> Corrects a sporadic error which occurred if the user's PC has the Long Date Format set to H:mm:ss.</p>
<h3>1.3.1 Status Pane / Custom Field Labels</h3>
<p>The ability to rename Field Labels is a good thing, but the user and/or support may need to see the Standard Label. &#160;The Standard Label has been added to the Status Pane display (at the bottom of the window) to the left of the internal field name and database name; it will be displayed the field is clicked on or hovered over.</p>
<h3>1.3.2 Pending Changes</h3>
<p>In previous versions, if two users were in the same record/journal, the first one to click the Save button had their changes saved, while the second one to Save would get the frustrating message that 'another user has updated the record and you must hit refresh.'</p>
<p>By default in this release, if user A changes a field and then tabs out of it, a Pending Changes flag is set in the Record Change Log. If user B accesses or starts to change the record, the system displays a message that</p>
<p style="margin-left: 48px;">Changes to this record are not allowed at this time.<br />
This record is currently being edited by another user.</p>
<p style="margin-left: 48px;">User <span style="font-style: italic;"><i>userid</i></span> started making changes to this record at <span style="font-style: italic;"><i>date - time</i></span>.</p>
<p style="margin-left: 8px;">Changes made from the Dispatch Board also support the pending changes functionality; if user B attempts to change a work order which user A has started to edit, the pending changes message (see above) will displayed.</p>
<p style="margin-left: 8px;">See Customer Release Note 1.1.1 for a registry to change the pending changes message from an error to a warning, or to disable it altogether.</p>
<h3>1.3.3 Company Name on Title Pane</h3>
<p style="margin-left: 8px;">Previously, the title pane of SAMPro windows used the companyname registry to display the Company Name. In this release, the new Company records are taken into account during user login as follows:</p>
<p style="margin-left: 48px;">1. If a Company record exists that has a Security Id that matches that of the User logging in, then the Company Name (if not blank) comes from the 'matching' Company record.</p>
<p style="margin-left: 48px;">2. If there is no match found in step #1 but the database contains exactly ONE Company record, then the Company Name (if not blank) comes from the single Company record.</p>
<p style="margin-left: 48px;">3. Use the 'companyname' registry setting as documented in help.</p>
<h3>1.3.4 Scrolling in Textbox Fields</h3>
<p style="margin-left: 8px;">The mouse's scroll wheel is supported in 'textbox' fields (e.g. the Work Order's Work Requested field). To use:</p>
<p style="margin-left: 48px;">Select the field on the screen<br />
Position the mouse cursor over the field<br />
Scroll with the mouse wheel</p>
<h3><span style="font-weight: bold;">1.3.5 Record List Panes</span></h3>
<p style="margin-left: 8px;">This release provides a performance enhancement when lists of records are accessed and resorted.</p>
<h3><span style="font-weight: bold;">1.3.6 Id Lookup Lists</span></h3>
<p style="margin-left: 8px;">This release provides improved performance when an Id-lookup list is initially opened (by double-clicking on an Id field or clicking the Lookup button <img src="image/IdSearch.gif" alt="" style="border: none;" border="0" />) and also when the user selects a different sort order in an Id-lookup list</p>
<h3>1.3.7 Keystrokes</h3>
<p style="margin-left: 8px;">In previous releases, Shift-Tab was treated like Ctrl+G (Go) in Viewers, Tabs and Reports. This could result in users inadvertently telling a function to Go (start) before they were ready. In this release, Shift+Tab moves the caret back one field.</p>
<p style="margin-left: 8px;">Ctrl+G also acts like Shift+Tab in records viewers, reports and starter function. &#160;Ctrl+G retains its 'Go' functionality only in the Viewer, Reports and Starter menus.</p>

<h3>1.8.1 Additional Profiles Enhancement</h3>
<p>In previous releases, the User's Additional Profiles tab only supported one line per Security Id. In this release, multiple lines may be entered per Security Id to support access to multiple User Groups then the user switch to the specified Security.</p>
<p style="margin-left: 48px;"><span style="font-weight: bold;">NOTE:</span> Additional Group Tab Support<br />
In addition to the User Groups specified on the Additional Profiles tab, the system will continue to grant the same access specified on the Additional Groups tab for Additional Profile Security as the Security specified on the User header.</p>
<p style="margin-left: 48px; text-decoration: underline;">Example:</p>
<p style="margin-left: 48px;">User Header:</p>

<p style="margin-left: 48px;">Security A they can access: Service, Inventory<br />
Security B they can access: Service, Inventory, Purchasing<br />
Security C they can access: Purchasing, Inventory</p>
<h3>1.8.2 Disabling User Terminates Active Sessions</h3>
<p>In previous releases, a User Account could be disabled while active sessions were running for the User; Active Sessions could be terminated from View Logon History but this required additional steps. In this release, disabling a User will terminate any active sessions.</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: bold;">Changed Field: Disabled</span><br />
If this field is flagged and the AND the User Account being disabled has active sessions a warning that &#160;'Active Sessions for this User will be terminated' will be displayed. The system will terminate all active sessions when a User Account is disabled and the record is saved. &#160;</p>
<p style="margin-left: 48px;"><span style="font-weight: bold;">Note:</span> If the user being disabled has unsaved changes it may be difficult for them to exit SAMPro; we recommend that you contact the user and instruct them to exit SAMPro. The UserLogonSummary tab should be used to determine if the selected User is active.</p>
<h3>1.8.3 New Tab: UserLogonSummary</h3>
<p style="margin-left: 8px;">This tab summarizes the SAMPro versions this User logged onto and if they are actively using the software.</p>
<p style="margin-left: 8px;"><span style="font-weight: bold;">VersionNo:</span><br />
The SAMPro Version Number which was/is being used.</p>
<p style="margin-left: 48px;"><span style="font-weight: bold;">Important Note:</span> A User must log off and back on SAMPro to be running the currently installed version. If this user has not done so, they may be running a session using an older version of the software which can lead to inconsistent results.</p>
<p style="margin-left: 8px;"><span style="font-weight: bold;">First Used - Last Used:</span><br />
The first and last date a session for the SAMPro version was active.</p>
<p style="margin-left: 8px;"><span style="font-weight: bold;">Active Sessions:</span><br />

<h2>1.10 Document Management</h2>
<h3>1.10.1 Scan Document Wizard</h3>
<p>This release corrects a sporadic document locking issue.</p>
<h3>1.10.2 QuickAttach</h3>
<p>The Client Site Equipment, Job Cost Code, and Job Billing Item records now support Quick Attach. Special programming was required for these dual-key record.</p>
<h3>1.10.2a Quick Attach Reference Enhancements</h3>
<p style="margin-left: 48px;">AR Cash Receipts: Quick Attachments also attach to the WorkOrder (via the Service Invoice) per detail line.</p>
<p style="margin-left: 48px;">Inventory Receipt Journal: Quick Attachments also attach to the Job and Work Order per detail line</p>
<p style="margin-left: 48px;">Inventory Adjustment Journal - Quick Attachments also attach to the WorkOrder per detail line; same approach as is done for Job.</p>
<p style="margin-left: 48px;">Purchase Order - Quick Attachments also attach to Job &amp; WorkOrders referenced on PO Details lines. &#160;Previously, only the header Job/Work Order were use. &#160;</p>
<h3>1.10.3 Start Document Archive Maintenance</h3>
<p>When Force Archive and Convert to PDF are both flagged, the archived .dbr file is now converted to a PDF. In previous releases, the file extension was changed but the file remained in .dbr format.</p>
<p style="margin-left: 8px;">The DBR to PDF function uses the report's internal bitmap path to set the pdf graphics if available.</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: bold;">Converted DBRs:</span><br />
This function now puts convertedDBRs in the root of the document\archive\convertedDBRs with subfoldering (YYYY-MM) if UseSubdirectories is enabled in the sys-document-archives registry.</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: bold;">New Field: Days Past to Check PDF Archives</span><br />
This field controls a new phase which has been added to this function to look for documents which failed to be converted from XML to PDF's; if any are found, the system will convert them to PDF's. &#160;</p>
<p>When this function is run, the system subtracts the NumberOfPastDaysToCheckPDFArchives in the registry from today's date to check all documents created <span style="font-style: italic;"><i>after</i></span> that date; if the archive file is a PDF file then it checks if it exists. If it doesn't then it checks if there is an XML document for that archive, and if there is it converts it to the PDF Archive.</p>
<p>By default, this field is set to 7: documents created within the last 7 days will be checked to see if &#160;they need to be converted to PDF's. &#160;If this field is set to 0, no Documents will be checked to set if they are XML files which need to be converted to PDF. &#160;The following registry allows the default value of the Days Past to Check PDF Archives field to be adjusted.</p>
<p style="font-weight: bold;">Registry Entry to Provide Default Days Past to Check PDF Archives</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: bold;">Id</span>: sys-start-sdcmntarchvemntnnce</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: bold;">Setting Key:</span> NumberOfPastDaysToCheckPDFArchives &#160;&#160;<span style="font-weight: bold;">Setting Value:</span> <span style="font-style: italic;"><i>numberofdays</i></span> (default is 7)</p>
<p>This registry entry provides the default value for this field for the manual Start Document Archive Maintenance function and the Start Document Archive Maintenance (Automated) function.</p>
<h3>1.10.4 Document Viewer</h3>
<p>This release corrects a 'Runtime Error: “isOkToRecord” not understood ' and the '"Archive File Location Does Not Exist" error' experienced by some users.</p>
<p>This release corrects a sporadic 'Runtime error: index: 1 is outside of collection bounds' which showed up in Windows 10 (fresh install) when trying to show an image in a Document record.</p>
<p>This release corrects a display issue with double-keyed records (e.g., Site Equipment) so that the Reference Name always defaults from the specified record.</p>
<p>Validation now requires that the Document File Location actually exists (in Add mode). &#160;In Change mode, the system checks that either the Document File Location or the&#160;Archive Location exists.</p>
<p>This release disables the requirement that Java is installed when viewing a PDF from SAMPro.</p>
<p>This release resolves file sharing error encountered by users when attempting to Save an existing Document record while the archives document file is displayed. In this release, the user is warned that the Archive File (filename) is in use. Closing the file will allow the Save to be completed.</p>
<p>This release also improves the management of data entry on the References child tab.</p>
<p style="margin-left: 48px;">1. Previously, entering a Reference Id before specifying a table resulted in a 'Key is Missing' error. In this release, the user is warned that a Valid Table Name must be entered.</p>
<p style="margin-left: 48px;">2. Validation of Table Names is no longer case-sensitive: entering 'Job' or &#160;'job' is acceptable.</p>
<p style="margin-left: 48px;">3. In this release, if the Table Name is changed, the Reference Id is cleared.</p>
<h3>1.10.4a &#160;File Location Supports Web Addresses</h3>
<p>Some users employ the Document Viewer to store web addresses instead of actual files. The File Location validation applied in earlier releases case caused this functionality to fail. In this release, the system ignores the location validation if the Location field begins with 'http://', 'https://' or "www.'.</p>
<p>If a web address is stored in the File Location field, clicking the View Document button launches a web browser pointing to the web address.</p>
<h3>1.10.5 Enhanced DocumentReferences Registry</h3>
<p>The DocumentReferences key allows the user to specify other tables for attachment during archiving button. In previous releases, the DocumentReferences registry was only supported for fields located in the parent record when attaching via the Attach button (paperclip) and Scan button. This registry option now also supports the attachment of records referenced in child records (for example, the Job and Work Orders referenced in the Inventory Adjustment Journal). &#160;</p>
<h3>1.10.6 Document Management - Journal Viewers</h3>
<p>This release refines the code used by Journals so that only documents attached to the selected journal entry and it's 'tack' versions (e.g., 1549, 1549-01, 1549-02 etc.) will be displayed. It corrects a problem in previous releases where too many documents might be displayed in the list of attachments for a journal entry. &#160;For example, if a user was in PO 1549 (note this is a 4 digit ID) the attachment list would also find 5 digit PO's (with the first 4 digits 1549) in an attempt to locate any&#160;possible documents attached to the base journal plus it's edited (tack) Id's.</p>
<h2>1.11 Scheduled Report Processing</h2>
<p>When emailing section key scheduled reports, the system now correctly saves them to the XmlToPdf folders within the dbreportfiles' registry path.&#160;Previously, they were saved to the root SAMPro directory.</p>
<h2>1.12 Intercompany Processing</h2>
<h3>1.12.1 Posting to Job History</h3>
<p>Corrects setting of Security in Job Cost History when Intercompany is enabled and posting is generated from the Labor Journal, Work Order, PR Journal &#160;and PR Checks.</p>
<h2>1.13 Book</h2>
<h3>1.13.1 Main Tab</h3>
<p><span style="font-weight: bold;">Changed Field - Book Id:</span><br />
The following characters are not allowed in Windows' folder names: \ / : * ? “ &lt; &gt; |. The system now denies these restricted characters when entering the Book Id so that SAMPro will be able to successfully create the Folder for the Book using the Book Id.</p>
<h2>1.14 Windows Date Localization</h2>
<p>This version provides additional support of Windows localization settings YYYY-MM-DD or = 'DD-MM-YYYY' for Canadian users. This version also works for dates formatted like "12\1\2014" or "12/01/2014".</p>
<h2>1.15 &#160;Use Outlook Enhancements / Revised xmlToPdf.jar</h2>
<p>When UseOutlook is enabled in the sys-email registry, this release handles setting the 'To' field for multiple addresses. For example, when emailing from the Collection viewer, the Client's Collections Email containing 0, 1 or 2 addresses (delimited with a comma or a semi-colon) will be inserted in the Outlook form's Email To field.</p>
<p>This release also supports setting Outlook's email 'To' field as well as defaulting pdf'd attachments The revised xmlToPdf.jar file (dated 2017/12/29 or later) is also required.</p>
<h3>1.15.1 <span style="mso-fareast-font-family: 'Times New Roman';">Default and Java 8 XmlToPdf.jar Files</span></h3>
<p class="MsoNormal" style="margin-left: 6.0pt;"><span style="mso-bidi-font-weight: bold;">The default XmlToPdf.jar file included in this release will support both Java 7 and 8; it is dated</span> 2017-12-29. It supports the revised W-2 reporting format and corrects a file 'cannot find this file' error&#160;when running with UseOutlook enabled.</p>
<p class="MsoNormal"><b style="mso-bidi-font-weight: normal;">Enhanced Java 8 Functionality:</b> The newest XmlToPdf.jar file (included as XmlToPdf [2018-06-29].jar) requires Java 8. <b style="mso-bidi-font-weight: normal;">Java 8 must be installed on ALL machines that will do emailing, including one that runs scheduled events.</b> &#160;This file supports enhanced error handling to give a number of different status codes based on where the error was encountered and what type of error it was. It logs the error to a new XmlToPdf.log file in the root SAMPro directory.&#160;To use this functionality:</p>
<p class="MsoNormal" style="margin-left: .5in;">Change the name of the default XmlToPdf.jar file to XmlToPdfOUT.jar and then</p>
<p class="MsoNormal" style="margin-left: .5in;">Copy the XmlToPdf [2018-06-29].jar and change the name of the copy to XmlToPdf.jar</p>

<h2>1.18 Start Field Label Remapping</h2>
<p>In previous releases, a customization was required to change a label not directly associated with a field. An example is on the Site's parent Contact tab: the Site Contact 1: label over the contact information block. In this release, access to these labels has been added to the Start Field Label Remapping function.</p>
<p>When this function run, it will create or update a dictionary file called 'LabelRemap' that contains the field label replacements that you specify. This file should live in the same directory as the Data-Basics executable, v.exe. 'LabelRemap' is loaded on startup of the Data-Basics software. This file should only be edited by running the Start Field Label Remapping function, and <font style="font-weight: bold;">should be backed up on a regular basis</font>.</p>
<h5>Example: Customizing the Site Contact 1: label</h5>
<p>1. Run 'Start Field Label Remapping', the system will display an Open File dialog box, which should already should point to the LabelRemap file in the directory containing the SAMPro executable. Select Open.</p>
<p>2. The Initial Screen will display a Field Label filter which enables you to filter down which labels will be presented for possible renaming. For example, if you wanted to relabel the Site Contact 1: you could enter Site Contact 1: in the Field Label and then click Go.</p>
<p>3. A List will appear:</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: bold;">Field Label:</span><br />
This display-only field lists the standard field label used within the software.</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: bold;">Field Label Replacement:</span><br />
If this field is blank, the standard label (displayed on the left) will be used by the system. To replace the standard label, simply enter it as you want it displayed on the screen. To avoid screen layout difficulties, the length of the replacement label should not greatly exceed that of the standard label.</p>
<p>4. Click Go to complete the function and save the edited dictionary back to disk. Reopen the Site view to see the changes to the label.</p>
<p style="margin-left: 48px;"><span style="font-weight: bold;">Tip:</span><br />
To undo a label remapping to use the default label, simply clear the remapping field, and the system will start using the original.</p>
<h2>1.19 Record Cloning</h2>
<p>When the auto-sequencing of Id's is in effect for a record, it is impossible to 'clone' a record by changing its Id and then tabbing out of the field since entering a non-existent Id is prohibited. This prevented users from 'cloning' an Employee record when auto-sequencing is turned on.</p>
<p>In this release, a new option, Clone, has been added to the Record menu of most records in SAMPro. When the Clone option is selected for an eligible record, its Id will be cleared, and the Add button enabled. &#160;In the case of the Employee record, all fields on the Main, Direct Deposit and Events tabs will also be cleared. When the user has finished editing the record, it can be Added as usual.</p>
<p>Cloning validation requires that the record being cloned does not have any unsaved changes. The Record &gt; Cloning functionality is specifically denied for the following records:</p>
<p style="margin-left: 48px;">Journals<br />
Check<br />
Client Order - Client Order Pick List - Client Order to Ship<br />
Invoice Master<br />
Project Manager Workbench<br />
Job Progress<br />
Physical Count<br />
Purchase Order<br />
Quote - Quote Manager - Quote Scope<br />
Shop Order - Shop Order Pick List<br />
Vendor Invoice<br />
Web Log</p>
<h2><span style="font-weight: bold;">1.20 External Applications</span></h2>
<p style="margin-left: 8px;">By default, SAMPro now consults the Windows registry for the correct program to use when opening application files. However if the sys-openapp-commmands exists it overrides the Windows registry. &#160;&#160;</p>
<h2>1.21 Canadian Installations</h2>
<p style="margin-left: 8px;"><span style="font-weight: bold;">Vendor Record:</span> A new standard label, 1099 Required: has been added to the left of the 1099-MISC? check box in the CA customization, and CA-based customizations. Because a standard label is in place, the Custom Fields functionality may now be used to relabel 1099 Required: to an appropriate value for Canadian companies. A new customization is required to see the change. Note that the 1099-MISC? text to the right of the check box cannot be changed in the current framework.</p>
<h2>1.22 View User Group Enhancements</h2>
<p>View User Groups has been enhanced to simplify the process of enabling access to SAMPro functions, reports and analytics as an alternative to the older View User Group and Functions which listed all functions, reports on the same child tab. Tabs have been added for Viewers, Reports, Processes (Starter functions) and Analytics. This will make it easier to locate items to enable/disable.</p>
<p>This release corrects a problem where 'cloning' a User Group (by changing the Id and tabbing out of the field) cleared all checked viewers, processes, report, analytics. In this release, the settings in the original User Group record are retained in the newly created one.</p>
<h5>New Tabs</h5>
<p class="Tab">Viewers Tab</p>
<p><font style="font-weight: bold;">Function Name:</font><br />
The name of the viewer; this display-only field is maintained by the system.</p>
<p><font style="font-weight: bold;">Access?</font><br />
If this field is checked, members of this group will have access to this function and can view all the information available on the record. &#160;If this box is blank, members of this group will not have access to the records in the function. &#160;However, users will be granted access to the LIST views.&#160;</p>
<p><font style="font-weight: bold;">Add</font><br />

<h2>1.23 Saved Range Processing (Viewers and Reports)</h2>
<p><font><span style="font-weight: normal;">In previous releases, a custom range filter could be deleted by</span></font> double-clicking on it in the Filter Ranges pane. The system then displayed a confirmation box; clicking Yes or pressing Enter removed the range. This resulted in users accidentally removing ranges unintentionally.</p>
<p>In this release, when the user right-clicks a saved Range, they will be prompted to Delete or Clone the Range for use by another User. &#160;</p>
<p style="margin-left: 48px;">If Delete is selected, the range will be deleted if allowed: users may delete their own ranges. Notes Administrators may also delete Global ranges created by other Users.</p>
<p style="margin-left: 48px;">If Clone is selected, the User Id field must be completed with the User the range should be given to (if the User already has a range of this name, a warning will be displayed). This User will 'own' their copy of the Range and may deleted if desired.</p>
<h2>1.24 Login</h2>
<h3>1.24.1 Sybase 11</h3>
<p>This release corrects login issues experienced by Sybase 11 users.</p>

<h2>1.25 <span style="font-weight: bold;">Start Dashboard Post</span></h2>
<p>This new function may be run as a Scheduled Event as an alternative to running Start Dashboard Event Manager as a service. Contact your support representative for details.</p>
<h2>1.26 &#160;MS SQL Server Conversion: Nonclustered to Clustered Primary Keys</h2>
<p>During our work to improved SAMPro database indexes, we have found that by changing the main primary key index (RN column) from a NONCLUSTERED to a CLUSTERED index, it boosts the overall performance of the SAMPro database. This change has been implemented as part of the SAMPro upgrade.</p>
<p>Normally SAMPro looks to see which tables need to be changed for the upgrade, and then processes just those tables. With this release, it will also check to see which indexes need to be switched to clustered. Since all tables with need their primary index to be changed to clustered, ALL tables must be updated, resulting in a longer conversion time. &#160;After database has been upgraded with this code, it should never need to be ran again, so subsequent upgrades will go back to “normal”. The end result is that every table will have a clustered primary key index.</p>
<h3>1.26.1 To Reclaim Space After an Upgrade</h3>
<p>After an upgrade, support will be able to shrink the database to reclaim the extra disk space left after this work. Otherwise the database container will remain the same size until the data fills back up to that level. In some cases, we are seeing 20-30GB of reclaimed space which would take a long time to get back to that level.</p>
<h3>12.26.2 Upgrade Processing - Additional Pre-Conversion Checks for SQL Server</h3>
<p>For SQL Service database users, SAMPro will check for database table change rights and uncommitted transactions to ensure a successful database conversion.</p>
<h2>1.27 Event &#160;Managers</h2>
<p>The Dashboard, Point Of Sale, Reports, Scheduled Events and TechAnywhere Events Managers better handle recurring events that have been interrupted and need re-scheduled.</p>
<h2>1.28 Licensing</h2>
<p>This release closes a loophole which allowed more Full User and TechAnywhere (Technician) records to be created than allowed by the Data-Basics license. If the maximum has been exceeded, the User/Technician records cannot be edited except to disable them.&#160;If this occurs:</p>
<p style="margin-left: 48px;"><span style="font-weight: bold;">User Record:</span> Flag the Disabled flag on any Full User record not in service.</p>
<p style="margin-left: 48px;"><span style="font-weight: bold;">Technician Record:</span> Active Techs not currently using TechAnywhere should have the Remote Device Type set to None so they will not be included in the TechAnywhere license count. These Technicians will not have access to TechAnywhere.</p>
<p style="margin-left: 48px;"><img src="RDTNone.jpg" alt="" style="border: none;" border="0" /></p>
<p style="margin-left: 48px;">&#160;</p>
<p style="margin-left: 8px;">If additional Full User and/or Technician licenses are still required after disabling unused records, contact your SAMPro account manager.</p>
<h2><span style="font-weight: bold;">1.29 CrystalViewer Web 4.0</span></h2>
<p style="margin-left: 8px;">This program written by Data-Basics Inc. allows SAMPro users to view Crystal Reports on their workstations. This program is only for viewing existing Crystal Reports and not for any type of report development. See the CrystalViewerWeb 4.0 SAMPro.pdf file (available from Support) for installation details.</p>
<h2>1.30 PDFJoiner.jar Enhancements</h2>
<p>The revised PDFJoiner.jar file dated 2018-03-14 now supports joining secured pdf's, such as invoices received from Vendors. When the Make PDF button is clicked (or other functionality involving a PDF merge is invoked), pdf's that do not require a password to open will be merged. PDF's that do require a password to open will be skipped.&#160;&#160;</p>

<p>If this registry is not present, the user will not be notified if the Last PO Receipt Date precedes the AP Journal's Effective Date.</p>
<p>If a Setting Value of warning is specified, the user will be Warned on adding/saving the entry if the AP Journal's Effective Date precedes the Last PO Receipt date. If the entry is in Add mode, the user will be given the opportunity to change the Effective Date before adding the entry:</p>
<p style="margin-left: 48px;">WARNING: Effective Date should not precede PO Last Receipt Date<br />
Select YES to use the date or<br />
Select No to correct the date before saving.</p>
<p style="-webkit-text-stroke-width: 0px;"><span style="text-decoration-style: initial; text-decoration-color: initial;">If a Setting Value of error is specified, the user will be not be allowed to add the entry until the Effective Date is corrected.

<p style="margin-left: 48px;"><span style="font-weight: bold;">Note:</span> AP Journal's Last PO Receipt Date<br />
This display field displays the most recent receipt date of the selected PO.</p>
<p style="margin-left: 48px;">If the AP Journal is in Add mode and the User has selected from a list of IRJ transactions, this field displays the IRJ's Date Received. NOTE:&#160;this refinement ONLY applies during ADD mode because the selected IRJ is not saved with the APJ entry.&#160;For edits of existing transactions, the overall last Date Received of all Inventory Receipts will be used.</p>
<p style="margin-left: 48px;">If items were received on the PO itself, the PO's Release Date will be displayed.</p>
<h5>3.1.7a AP Journal Registry to Use Default Service Job in the Equipment record for all but PM WO’s</h5>
<p><font style="font-weight: bold;">Registry Id: <span style="font-weight: normal;">sys-viewer-</span></font>vapjrnl</p>
<p><font style="font-weight: bold;">Setting Key:</font> DefaultJobByEquipmentId&#160;<font style="font-weight: bold;">Setting Value:</font> true</p>
<p>By default, the system uses the Job in the Work Order header as the default job for entering WO-related detail in the AP Journal. This release supports the above registry setting to alter this behavior. If this registry entry is enabled (and the referenced WO is NOT preventative maintenance), the system will check to see if there is a default service job in the Equipment header. If so, the Job, Cost Code and Billing item to the from the Equipment will be defaulted instead of from the WO header. If the job info is blank in the equipment record, the system uses the job info in the work order header.</p>
<p>For Preventive Maintenance Work Orders, Job information defaults from the WO header, regardless of whether or not this registry entry is enabled.</p>
<h2>3.2 Accounts Payable Reports</h2>
<h3>3.2.1 Report AP Check</h3>
<p>This release locks out AP Check generation when the Vendor Invoice is "in use" by the AP Date To Pay Function to prevent inadvertent double payments by&#160;resetting the Next Net and Net Gross Pay Amounts.</p>
<p>This release corrects sporadic locking issues when various users attempted to print AP Checks for different securities at the same time.</p>
<p>The system now prevents the user from running the check report if the Checklist screen is open but the Check Report screen has been closed. &#160;</p>
<p>EFT/AFT check images now indicate 'Direct Deposit Advice' and 'Void' like they do for Payroll EFT's.</p>
<h3>3.2.2 Canadian T5018 Forms</h3>
<p>This release includes changes to support the two vendor per page format (previously was three vendors per page). This system report is part of the software and does not need to be imported into your database.</p>

<p class="MsoNormal" style="margin-left: 48px;">There is currently no way to process multiple Payer Type ‘A’ records</p>
<p class="MsoNormal" style="margin-left: 48px;">There is a TIN type field in the Payee Type ‘B’ records which&#160;should be set to ‘1’ for an EIN number and ‘2’ for a SSN. This is currently handled by checking the Federal Tax Id field on Vendor's 1099 tab. &#160;If the Id has a dash in the 3rd position it is processed as an EIN; otherwise it is considered to be an SSN.</p>

<h3>3.2.11 New Report: Report AP Vendor Payment History</h3>
<p>The new Report AP Vendor Payment history (RVNDRPYMNTHSTRY.rpt dated 2/15/2018) will show the total amount paid by select vendors based on a beginning and ending date range that is specified by the user when running the report. These two dates correlate with the AP history effective date. The report detail includes the vendor ID, vendor name, city, state, and total amount paid to that vendor.</p>
<h3>3.2.12 Expired Insurance Certificate Notice Report</h3>
<p><span style="font-weight: normal;">The Expired Insurance Notice Report (REXPIRDINSRNCE.rpt) dated 2018-05-08 has been updated to provide for bitmap placement (by specifying the new Lines adjustment field on the report range) as well as cosmetic work on the font and alignment. This report also has the functionality to automatically email vendors when their insurance on file has expired.</span>&#160;&#160;</p>
<h2>3.3 AP Journal</h2>
<p style="margin-left: 8px;">Corrects an error -143 from the previous release when a Credit Purchase Order is selected.</p>
<p>Job Cost Categories are not needed if a Job/Work Order is not specified. When loading an APJ entry into the viewer, the Job Cost Category will be cleared if a Job is NOT specified on a detail line.</p>
<p>This release corrects the calculation of Tax Cost on subsequent AP entries where the PO had previously been partially vouchered.</p>
<p>This release closes a loophole which allowed users to voucher Credit PO's multiple times. Detail lines which have previously been vouchered will no longer load from the Credit PO when the user enters the PO ID for a new AP Journal entry.</p>
<p>This release refines the allocation of line item Tax Cost credit amounts to Tax Authorities. A Tax Authority only qualifies for inclusion in the allocation when EITHER of the two conditions noted below is true:</p>
<p style="margin-left: 48px;">1. The APJ line's Tax Type is Use.</p>
<p style="margin-left: 48px;">2. The Group Tax Authority line's Job Cost flag is True.</p>
<p style="margin-left: 8px;">The Show Invoice button is now disabled when the AP Journal is in Add mode.</p>
<p style="margin-left: 8px;">If any changes have been made to the Vendor Invoice since the AP Journal was last saved, the user will be warned and must refresh the record before continuing.</p>
<p style="margin-left: 8px;">Corrects row lock issues in recent releases.</p>
<p style="margin-left: 8px;">This release validates that the Effective Date falls within the specified Accounting Period when deleting an entry.</p>
<h3>3.3.1 AP Journal Main Tab</h3>
<p><span style="font-weight: bold;">New Field: Last PO Receipt</span><br />
This display field displays the most recent receipt date of the selected PO.</p>
<p>If the AP Journal is in Add mode and the User has selected from a list of IRJ transactions, this field will be displayed based on the IRJ's Date Received. WARNING:&#160;this refinement ONLY applies during ADD mode because the selected IRJ is not saved with the APJ entry.&#160;For edits of existing transactions, the overall last Date Received of all Inventory Receipts will be used.</p>
<p>If items were received on the PO itself, the PO's Release Date will be displayed.</p>
<p>See Customer Note 3.1.7 for a registry to display an Error or Warning when selecting a PO whose Last PO Receipt date precedes the AP Journal's Effecting Date.</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: bold;">GL Entity Id:</span><br />
<span style="font-weight: bold;">AP Manual Checks: Bank Account GL Account Id<br /></span>In this release, postings to the Bank Account ONLY use the GL Entity specified in the AP Journal header when InterCompany is enabled via registry. If Inter-Company is NOT enabled, the GL Entity is not used for Manual Check / EFT / CC posting and Check records.</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: bold;">Changed Button - Add Taxes:</span><br />
The Add Taxes buttons now splits taxes correctly between the GL Accounts referenced in the Tax Group's Authorities.</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: bold;">New Field - Lien Waiver Req'd?</span><br />
This display-only field defaults from the Job / Work Order referenced in the PO's header. The user will be warned when creating an AP Journal entry referencing a Job that requires a Lien Waiver.</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: bold;">New Field - &#160;Use Tax Total:</span><br />
This display-only field provides a running total of the Use Tax Cost entered on the Inventory, General and Subcontractor lines, excluding lines which have been copied for edit.</p>
<h3>3.3.2 AP Journal Taxes Tab</h3>
<p>The system now uses the Sales Tax Authority's default GL Expense Account (when available) for sales tax paid.</p>
<h3>3.3.3 AP Journal General Tab</h3>
<p>This release corrects an issue where the Equipment Id was not defaulted. This only occurred if a PO was not specified on the AP entry but a Work Order Id was enters on the General tab.</p>
<p>Reversing General lines are now flagged as No Discount to avoid discount calculation issues when the Date Effective is edited.</p>
<p>In previous releases, if a General line was added for a Job/WO related entry, the Tax Type was not evaluated correctly if the Cost Category defaulted in from an Other Rate.&#160;&#160;Defaulting the Cost Category now correctly triggers the field validation so that the Tax Cost and the Tax Type Id are set properly. &#160;</p>
<h3>3.3.4 &#160;Multiple Inventory Receipt Journal Entry Enhancement &#160;</h3>
<p>In previous releases, the AP Journal Viewer always auto-filled its child tabs when a PO number was entered: if there were multiple Inventory Receipts Journal entries for the PO, all were loaded.</p>
<p>In this release, the system checks to see if multiple IRJ entries are present. If so, it displays a list so that the user may choose to load &#160;choose All or a specify IRJ entry. If the user chooses a specific Id, only the quantities received in that entry will be loaded.</p>
<p class="Support" style="margin-left: 48px;"><img src="MultiReceipt.bmp" alt="" style="border: none;" width="405" height="168" border="0" /></p>
<p>If multiple receipts are NOT present or receipts were only made on the PO, the selection box will not be display, and received items will be autoloaded as before.</p>
<p>Previously received IRJ transactions will NOT be removed from the list. &#160;It is hoped that this limitation will be corrected in a future version. &#160;If you select a previously selected receipt, the system will load the quantity specified on that receipt if they have not already been load. &#160;Validation prevents the AP Quantity from exceeding the quantity received in the IRJ or PO.</p>
<p>If items are received on both the PO and the IRJ for the same PO (not recommended!), All must be selected to pull in the stragglers received on the PO.</p>
<h2>3.4 Vendor Viewer</h2>
<h3>3.4.1 Contacts Tab</h3>
<p>The following phone extension fields have been expanded to 7 digits in this release:</p>
<p style="margin-left: 48px; font-weight: bold;">Vendor Contact 1 Extension<br />
Vendor Contact 2 Extension</p>
<h3>3.4.2 Additional Contacts Tab</h3>
<p>The following phone extension fields have been expanded to 7 digits in this release:</p>
<p style="margin-left: 48px; font-weight: bold;">Vendor Additional Contacts Tab Ext.</p>
<h3>3.4.3 Vendor 'No Inventory' implementation</h3>
<p style="font-weight: bold;">Vendor Viewer Defaults Tab New Field</p>
<p style="font-weight: bold;">No Inventory?<br />
<span style="font-weight: normal;">If this field is checked, users are prevented from selecting this Vendor for Inventory Parts in the following records:</span></p>
<p style="margin-left: 48px;">Purchase Order Inventory Tab<br />
Work Order Required Resources Tab<br />
Quote Inventory Tab<br />
COP Dropship Wizard</p>
<p>This field may not be checked if the Vendor is referenced on any Inventory Item record's Purchasing tab. If the user attempts to do so, an error will be displayed and, a workspace opened listing the Inventory Items referencing the Vendor.</p>
<p style="font-weight: bold;">Inventory Item Purchasing Tab</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: bold;">Vendor Id:</span><br />
The Vendor Id may not be set if the Vendor is flagged as "No Inventory".</p>
<h3>3.4.5 Vendor Viewer Defaults Tab</h3>
<p style="font-weight: bold; margin-left: 8px;">New Field: 1 Invoice Per Check?<br />
<span style="font-weight: normal;">If this field is flagged, when AP Checks/EFT's are generated for this Vendor, one Check &#160;will be printed for each Vendor Invoice.</span></p>
<p style="margin-left: 48px;"><span style="font-weight: bold;">Important Note on Credit Memos:</span><br />
Vendor credit memos are separate invoices and an AP Check can't be negative. &#160;To process a Credit Memo, temporarily uncheck the I Invoice Per Check field and apply the credit memo to an outstanding invoice or 2, or 3.</p>
<h3>3.4.6 Vendor Viewer Open Invoices Tab</h3>
<p>AP Retainage is now included in the calculation of the AmountOwed column.</p>
<h2>3.5 Start Create EOM Unvouchered AP GL Entries</h2>
<p style="margin-left: 8px;">JCH Cost analysis is only 'necessary' for lines where PO Qty Ordered &lt;&gt; PO Job Quantity Ordered. This function has been enhanced to not care about JCH except when necessary. &#160;This should eliminate the PO-GEN line issue caused by editing WO-Other Descriptions because a PO-GEN line's quantity is either all or nothing to a job.</p>
<p style="margin-left: 8px;">GEN lines from Credit POs are completely ignored unless the line's Receipted-to-JCH flag is true.</p>
<p>This function now posts the Job reference to GL History for Credit type PO's and the Work Order reference to GL History for all POs.</p>
<p>This release includes performance enhancements to the generation of the View Summary and View Detail report when this function is run. If the registry entry to disable these reports (Customer Release Note 3.1.3) was enabled, you may be able to turn it off in this release.</p>
<p>The Work Order and Job Id's (if available) are now included in the 'View Details' report.</p>
<h2><span style="font-weight: bold;">3.6 Start Release Recurring AP Journal</span></h2>
<p>This release includes security and branch override logic so that the AP Journals generated by this function have their Security and or Branch set correctly. &#160;</p>
<h2>3.7 Start AP Payment Approved</h2>
<p>This function now classifies AP Retainage properly. This corrects an issue where the Vendor Invoice: TotalOwed went negative while the Retainage remained positive.</p>
<h2>3.7 Start AP Payment Approved PM</h2>
<p>This function now classifies AP Retainage properly. This corrects an issue where the Vendor Invoice: TotalOwed went negative while the Retainage remained positive.</p>
<h2>3.8 Start Select Invoices for Payment (Date to Pay)</h2>
<p>This release locks out AP Check generation when the Vendor Invoice is "in use" by the AP Date To Pay Function to prevent inadvertent double payments by&#160;resetting the Next Net and Net Gross Pay Amounts.</p>
<p>This release implements special handling for 'over paid' invoices so that the overpayment is NOT erroneously defaulted to the Discount and Retainage fields.</p>
<p>The Next Pay Amount field is now completed appropriately when the Next Pay Day is blank (01/01/1900).</p>
<h1>4 Purchasing</h1>
<h2>4.1 Purchasing Registries</h2>
<h3>4.1.1 Start Generate Recurring PO Shipping Address</h3>
<p style="margin-left: 8px;">This function now support the setting key sqlshipToStockLocation which allows the user to fine-tune the ship-to address on the purchase order.</p>
<p style="margin-left: 8px;"><span style="font-weight: bold;">Registry Id:</span> sys-start-sgnrteprchseordrs</p>
<p style="margin-left: 8px;"><span style="font-weight: bold;">Setting Key:</span> sqlshipToStockLocation &#160;&#160;<span style="font-weight: bold;">Setting Value:</span> <span style="font-style: italic;"><i>SQL Select List</i></span></p>
<p style="margin-left: 8px;">The SQL Select List defines which fields from the Location will be inserted into the corresponding fields in the Purchase Order Ship To address. The select list MUST include all seven columns necessary to construct the ship-to address as follows:</p>
<p style="margin-left: 48px;">&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;1. street address line 1<br />
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;2. street address line 2<br />
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;3. street address line 3<br />
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;4. street address line 4<br />
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;5. city<br />
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;6. state<br />
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;7. zip code</p>
<p style="margin-left: 8px;">If you will not be using all of the address lines, you may include a blank ‘ ‘ in the select list. Token replacement for ^companyname^ is also supported.&#160;&#160;^companyname^ will be replaced by the contents of the companyname registry when the shipping address is defaulted.</p>
<p style="margin-left: 48px; font-weight: bold; text-decoration: underline;">Example:</p>
<p style="margin-left: 48px;">This example uses the ^companyname^ token replacement to set the first line of the address, and skips the fourth line of the street address by specifying a blank ‘ ‘.</p>
<p style="margin-left: 48px;">sqlShipToStockLocation='^companyname^', lctn_addrss_shp_addrss_strt, lctn_addrss_shp_addrss_strt_2, ' ', lctn_addrss_shp_addrss_cty, lctn_addrss_shp_addrss_stte, lctn_addrss_shp_addrss_zp</p>
<h3><span>4.1.2 Registry to Default the PO Tax Group from the Job</span></h3>
<p>This release enhances the functionality of the existing DefaultPOTaxGroupFromJob registry option.&#160;&#160;Previously, if the registry was in effect, but the Vendor was entered AFTER the Job or Work Order, the Vendor's Tax Group was always overwriting whatever defaulted from the Work Order / Job - even if it was blank in the Vendor.&#160;&#160;</p>
<p>In this release, if this registry is enabled, entering the Vendor after the Job/Work Order has been set will only update the PO's Tax Group from the Vendor Record if is was blank in the PO. This ensures that the &#160;Vendor's Tax Group will not override the Job's Tax Group.</p>
<p>This release adds support for the DefaultPOTaxGroupFromJob registry for Purchase Orders created via the Dispatch Board's Create PO button.</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: bold;">Registry Id:</span> sys-viewer-vprchseordrlst &#160;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: bold;">Setting Key:</span> DefaultPOTaxGroupFromJob &#160;<span style="font-weight: bold;">Setting Value:</span> true (default is false)</p>
<h3>4.1.3 Enhancement to Global Registry InventoryCostIcludesTax Option</h3>
<p>If the InventoryCostIncludesTax is set to true is enabled in the global registry, and appropriate 'job cost' tax authority/tax group is set in the Vendor record, prepaid tax cost is calculated as inventory is added to the PO. In previous releases, if the tax group was NOT specified in the Vendor record, but instead manually specified in the PO before adding inventory lines, the tax cost was not added to the inventory items so that it could be included in the inventoried cost. This release includes the following corrections to this functionality:</p>
<p style="margin-left: 48px;">Taxes are calculated based on the 'job cost' Tax Group in the PO Header, NOT the Vendor record.</p>
<p style="margin-left: 48px;">Changing the Tax Group on a PO detail line recomputes the sales tax on that line</p>
<p>In addition, the Inventory Receipts Journal now calculates Sales Tax received based on the PO's Sales Tax Group.</p>
<h3>4.1.4 Adjust Date or Accounting Period for Subcontractor POs Generated in New Call</h3>
<p>By default, if a Subcontractor PO is auto-generated in New Call, there is no validation as to the Release Date and the Accounting period; today's date and the default Accounting Period are always used on the auto-generated PO unless trumped by the sys-newcall registry option AutoPOPeriodID.</p>
<p>In this release, the following registry entry allows either the Date or Accounting Period to be adjusted to keep them in sync for Purchase Orders generated from New Call only. &#160;If this registry is not enabled, the default Accounting Period and today's date will continue to be used. Note: this setting will also be trumped by the sys-newcall registry option AutoPOPeriodID if enabled.</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: bold;">Id:</span> sys-viewer-vprchseordrlst</p>
<p>When the defaulted Release Date and Accounting Period are NOT out-of-sync, NO adjustments are made to the defaulted values when a PO is generated from New Call.&#160;&#160;The rules noted below are used only when an adjustment is necessary.</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: bold;">Setting Key:</span> AdjustDefaultDateOrPeriod &#160;&#160;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: bold;">Setting Value:</span> period<br />
The Accounting Period table is queried for eligible Accounting Periods.&#160;&#160;To qualify, the period must be Active and its date range must include the defaulted Release Date.&#160;&#160;When multiple periods are eligible, the one with the smallest Period Id is chosen to become the new Accounting Period for the current transaction.&#160;&#160;If no eligible period is found, nothing is changed.</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: bold;">Setting Value:</span> date<br />
The Release Date is adjusted to be either the Start Date or the End Date of the defaulted Accounting Period.&#160;&#160;The Start Date is chosen when the current date is less than the Start Date.&#160;&#160;The End Date is chosen when the current date is greater than the End Date.</p>
<h5>4.1.4a Registry to Use Default Service Job in the Equipment record for all but PM WO’s</h5>
<p><font style="font-weight: bold;">Registry Id: <span style="font-weight: normal;">sys-viewer-</span></font>vprchseordrlst</p>
<p><font style="font-weight: bold;">Setting Key:</font> DefaultJobByEquipmentId&#160;<font style="font-weight: bold;">Setting Value:</font> true</p>
<p>Note that this registry is also applied to PO's posted from TechAnywhere.</p>
<p>By default, the system uses the Job in the Work Order header as the default job for entering WO-related detail in the Labor, Purchase Order and AP Journal. This release supports the above registry settings to alter this behavior. If this registry entry is enabled (and the referenced WO is NOT preventative maintenance), the system will check to see if there is a default service job in the equipment header. If so, the Job, Cost Code and Billing item to the from the Equipment will be defaulted instead of from the WO header. If the job info is blank in the equipment record, the system uses the job info in the work order header.</p>
<p>For Preventive Maintenance Work Orders, Job information defaults from the WO header, regardless of whether or not this registry entry is enabled.</p>
<p>Note: a registry option to provide this functionality in the Work Order itself is already supported in sys-viewer-vwrkordr.</p>
<p>Note: registry options to provide this functionality are also available in the Work Order, AP Journal and Labor Journal registries.</p>
<h3>4.1.5 Start Create EOM Unvouchered AP GL Entries</h3>
<p>When IntercompanyEnabled global registry is set to true, then Balance Sheet GL Entities are universally required. Previously, Start Create EOM Unvouchered AP GL Entries required the following registry to determine a "credit-side" GL Entity. In this release, Credit Side Entities will be specified if EITHER of the following registries is enabled:</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: bold;">Id:</span> sys-start-seomunvchrdap</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: bold;">Setting Key:</span> CreditsByEntity &#160;<span style="font-weight: bold;">Setting Value:</span> true</p>
<p>-or-</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: bold;">Id:</span> sys-ffv-global-settings &#160;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: bold;">Setting Key:</span> IntercompanyEnabled &#160;<span style="font-weight: bold;">Setting Value:</span> true</p>
<h2>4.2 Purchasing Reports</h2>
<p>&#160;</p>
<h2>4.3. Purchase Order Viewer</h2>
<p>This release eliminates a sporadic “Runtime Error: system primitive failed”&#160;experienced when saving a PO when the Unvouchered A/P box is flagged in the Accounting Period and receipts are made directly on the PO. &#160;</p>
<p>When a PO record is loaded or saved, the Job Cost Category will be cleared if a Job is NOT specified on a detail line. This release also tightens Job Cost Category / Job validation.</p>
<p>A new PO may be created by clicking the Create PO button on the Job or Work Order viewer. If the BranchOverrideFrom global option is set to 'job' &#160;the Branch is correctly reset from the Job's Branch when the Vendor is entered.</p>
<p>&#160;Order Id filled in before the Vendor is selected.</p>
<p>Corrects spurious Tab Mismatch errors encountered when a PO is created or edited for a foreign currency Vendor (Currency Id set in Vendor record). <span style="font-weight: bold;">&#160;</span></p>
<p>This release corrects a recent issue where the Add button was enabled when the Vendor was changed on an existing PO. &#160;Also improves the 'blocked purchases' validation.</p>
<p>If a PO is started by clicking New, the Ship To address defaults using the sqlshipToStockLocation registry option. Previously, it was ignored if the Location defaulted as a sticky field.</p>
<p>Corrects a problem generating PO's from Quotes or WO's when the user switches security.</p>
<p>Corrects the posting of Credit POs costed to Work Orders/Jobs.</p>
<h3>4.3.1 Purchase Order Main Tab</h3>
<p style="font-weight: bold;">New Field: Payments Blocked:<br />
<span style="font-weight: normal;">If this display field is checked, the Vendor’s required Insurance is currently expired, and payments will be blocked in AP. Today’s date is compared with the Start and End Dates on the Vendor's Insurance tab to determine if the Insurance is expired.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: bold;">Purchase Order: New Field - Lien Waiver Req'd?</span><br />
This display-only field defaults from the Job / Work Order referenced in the PO's header. The user will be warned when creating a PO for a Job that requires a Lien Waiver.</p>
<p>The Lien Waiver warning message is silenced when PO Orders referencing a Lien Waiver Job are generated via the Quote and Quote Manager Approval Wizards.</p>
<h3>4.3.2 Purchase Order Inventory Tab</h3>
<p><span style="font-weight: bold;">Changed Field: Use Tax</span><br />
Use Tax is now recalculated when the Inventory Item Id is changed. Previously, it was set when the Item was first entered, and when its quantity or cost changed. &#160;&#160;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: bold;">Changed Field: Unit Cost</span><br />
The Vendor's last cost (from the Item's Vendor tab) now defaults if the Item is entered by using the Vendor Part Id.</p>
<h3>4.3.3 Purchase Orders from Quote / Quote Manager</h3>
<p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">Previously, the system disallowed changing the Vendor on PO's generated from a Quote.&#160;This restriction has been relaxed so that the Vendor can be changed if no receipts have been performed on the PO and it is NOT a Subcontractor PO.&#160;&#160;</p>
<h3>4.3.4 <span style="font-weight: bold;">Subcontractor Tab</span>&#160;</h3>
<p style="font-weight: bold; margin-left: 8px;">Changed Fields: Tax Cost &#160;- Tax Group Id<br />
<span style="font-weight: normal;">If a Tax Group flagged as Job Cost is specified on the Purchase Order header, it will now be used to calculate the Tax Cost on the Subcontractor tab: the committed cost will include the tax. &#160;When the AP journal is recorded, the tax shown in the Subcontractor will be job costed on top of the value, and would debit the expense account and credit the tax payable account. In previous releases, this functionality was only supported on the Inventory and General tabs, and the PO header Job's (or Work Order's Job) Tax Group was incorrectly referenced on the Subcontractor tab.</span></p>
<p>Use Tax is now recalculated when the Amount fields are changed.</p>
<p style="margin-left: 8px;"><span style="font-weight: bold;">Changed Fields: &#160;Earned %: &#160;Amount Earned:</span><br />
Validation now prevents the amount earned from being reduced below the threshold of what have already been vouchered in A/P.</p>
<h3>4.3.5 &#160;Blocked Purchases Handling in the Purchase Order</h3>
<p>In previous releases, if a Vendor's Purchases were blocked due to expired insurance, the Purchase Order could be created with an Unreleased status. &#160;This led to problems with Vendors being given a PO Id when the Unreleased PO was created. In this version, if the</p>
<p style="margin-left: 48px;">Vendor is marked as Insurance Required = 'Y' &#160;AND<br />
Vendor Insurance End Date &lt; today AND<br />
Block Purchases = 'Y'</p>
<p>the user will be alerted and the PO will NOT be created.</p>
<p>This release also corrects an issue where a Purchase Order could not be created if the Vendor's Payments were blocked but Purchases were not.</p>
<h3><span style="font-weight: bold;">4.3.6 Purchase Order List</span></h3>
<p>The PO's "ordered by"&#160;field has been added to the sort option PurchaseOrderByVendorAlphaByIdByDescription after the status column.&#160;</p>
<h2>4.4 Start Generate Purchase Orders</h2>
<h3>4.4.1 Blocked Purchases Handling</h3>
<p>This function now checks to see if any PO's are for Vendors that are Blocked Purchase as of today. If they are, the user is&#160;alerted and the system displays a workspace with the list of blocked purchase Vendors. The function will continue to process Vendors that are not 'Blocked Purchase' as of today.</p>
<h2><span style="font-weight: bold;">4.5 Start Close Open POs</span></h2>
<p>This release corrects a problem where this function did not always apply Security to the history reversals lines generated by this function.</p>
<h1>5 Inventory</h1>
<h2>5.1 Inventory Registries</h2>
<h3>5.1.1 &#160;Registry to Limit Writing to Inventory Vendor Tab to Purchasing Agents</h3>
<p><span style="font-weight: bold;">Registry &#160;Id:</span> sys-viewer-vinvntryitm</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: bold;">Setting Key:</span> AllowPriceChangesOnlyByPurchaseAgents</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: bold;">Setting Value:</span> true &#160;&#160;(default false)</p>
<p>When the above registry is enabled, the following changes to default behavior will be in effect:</p>
<p style="margin-left: 48px;">&#160;<span style="text-decoration: underline;"><u>Inventory Item Viewer Vendors Tab</u></span></p>
<p style="margin-left: 88px;">Only Users flagged as Purchasing Agents are allowed to directly alter the Price field. When a change is made, a secure note will be created, and the Change Date and User Id on the Detail view will be update</p>
<p style="margin-left: 88px;">Users NOT flagged as Purchasing Agents are not allowed to delete lines, add lines, or insert with copy. &#160;They are allowed to update the Description filed.</p>
<p style="margin-left: 48px; text-decoration: underline;">Purchase Order Viewer</p>
<p style="margin-left: 88px;">When this registry is enabled, the Purchase Order will no longer update the Price field on existing line on the Inventory Item's Vendors Tab. When buying an Item from a Vendor for the first time, the PO viewer allows the creation of a new line on the Inventory Item Vendor tab, including the Price field.</p>
<p style="margin-left: 88px;">This functionality is supported for PO's created from the Purchase Order viewer, Quotemaster / Quote Manager, Start Generate Purchase Orders, and TechAnywhere.</p>
<p style="margin-left: 48px; text-decoration: underline;">AP Journal Viewer</p>
<p style="margin-left: 88px;">When this registry is enabled, the AP Journal will no longer update the Price field on the Inventory Item's Vendors Tab.</p>
<h3>5.1.2 Compute Corporate Metrics Registry to Refine Turns Calculation</h3>
<p>The following registry may be used to refine the Compute Corporate Metrics logic so that so that if an item’s on-hand quantity is &lt;=0 AND the transaction will reduce the quantity on hand further, the transaction is NOT used in the turns calculation. This change is incorporated in both the Inventory and Inventory By Location computations.</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: bold;">Id:</span> sys-corporate-metrics</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: bold;">Setting Key:</span> &#160;Turns-IncludePositiveOnHandOnly &#160;&#160;<span style="font-weight: bold;">Setting Value:</span> Yes &#160;(default No)</p>
<p>Any value beginning with 'Y' or 'T' (upper or lower case) will turn this option on.</p>
<h3>5.1.3 Registry to Create Warnings for Exceeding Quantity / Unit Cost Thresholds in Inventory Adjustments.</h3>
<p><span style="font-weight: bold;">Id:</span> sys-viewer-vinvntryadjstmnt &#160;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: bold;">Setting Key:</span> QuantityNotToExceed &#160;&#160;<span style="font-weight: bold;">Setting Value:</span> <span style="font-style: italic;"><i>threshold quantity</i></span></p>
<p>When this option is set and the quantity entered exceeds the value, &#160;a warning will display: 'Warning: Quantity entered exceeds limit entered in Registry'</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: bold;">Setting Key:</span> UnitCostNotToExceed &#160;&#160;<span style="font-weight: bold;">Setting Value:</span> <span style="font-style: italic;"><i>threshold cost</i></span></p>
<p>When this option is set and the unit cost manually entered exceeds the threshold cost value a warning will display: 'Warning: Unit Cost entered exceeds limit entered in Registry.'</p>
<h2>5.2 Inventory Reports</h2>
<h3>5.2.1 Report Inventory Audit (RINVNTRYADT.rpt)</h3>
<p>The revised report dated 2015/05/22 has been modified to remove detail lines which have zero quantity and zero cost.</p>
<h3><span style="font-weight: bold;">5.2.2 Stock Status Report</span></h3>
<p>This release corrects a minor rounding problem resulting in the sum of individual Location Totals not adding up to All Reported Locations Total.</p>
<h2>5.3 &#160;Inventory Item Record</h2>
<h3>5.3.1 Inventory Item Main Tab</h3>
<p><span style="font-weight: bold;">New Field - Bar Code</span><br />
This field may be used to specify a unique barcode value for this inventory item. It will be used with TechAnywhere for easier lookup/entry of the Inventory record via barcode scanning.</p>
<h3>5.3.2 Inventory Item Other Tab</h3>
<p><span style="font-weight: bold;">Changed Field - Superceded By: Inventory Item Id</span><br />
Validation now checks that the Inventory Item entered in this field exists. The user is allowed to clear the Superceded By field. However, clearing the field does not clear the Inactive flag which may have been set manually or via registry</p>
<h3>5.3.3 Inventory Item Pricing/Costing Tab</h3>
<p style="margin-left: 8px;"><span style="font-weight: bold;">Use Unit Prices? has been changed to Use Price Levels?</span><br />
The label change was made to more clearly describe the use of the field when the new revenue calculation functionality is in effect (see Customer Note 8.7).</p>
<h3>5.3.4 Inventory Item Average Unit Cost Calculations</h3>
<p style="margin-left: 8px;">In sporadic cases, receiving a quantity of an item at one price, and then vouchering it at a much lower price produced an adjustment (quantity * price adjustment) which could leave the quantity on hand with a negative value. In this release, the Cost on Hand is prevented from going negative.</p>
<h2>5.4 Inventory Receipts Journal</h2>
<p>Un-receipted lines are no longer displayed in existing journal entries to prevent the user from re-receipting in the same entry. This enforces the requirement to create a new Inventory Receipt entry to re-receipt the items. A registry entry (NOT recommended) is available to disable this behavior; contact your support rep. &#160;</p>
<p>This release corrects a sporadic problem where clicking the "Auto Set Qty Rec'd" button did not always complete the Location fields. Additional validation requires the Location field to be set when the Inventory Receipt is added or changed.</p>
<p>Sales Tax received is calculated based on the PO's Sales Tax Group. The PO's Sales Tax Group is now displayed correctly the Main tab (previously the Vendor's Sales Tax Group).</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: bold;">Changed Field - Job Qty Received:</span><br />
This field is now display-only. It is maintained by the system based on the Job Quantity ordered in the PO, and the Quantity Received. &#160;If the user wishes to change it, the Job Quantity Ordered must be changed in the originating PO.</p>
<h3>5.4.1 New Tab: Summary</h3>
<p><span style="font-weight: bold;">PO Id: &#160;Vendor Id: &#160;Tax Group Id:</span><br />
These display-only fields default from the Purchase Order's Main tab. Note that the Tax Group Id will only be completed if it is completed in the Purchase Order's Main tab.</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: bold;">Subtotal:</span><br />
This field displays the expected Vendor Invoice cost total based on this Inventory Receipt.</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: bold;">Tax:</span><br />
This field displays the tax anticipated to be assessed on vendor's invoice from this Inventory Receipt. This field will ONLY be completed if a Sales Tax Group with "job costed" authorities exists on the Purchase Order Main Tab. &#160;If a Tax Group is not specified on the PO Main Tab, or if one is specified but it is NOT "job costed", this field will NOT display the calculated tax.</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: bold;">Total:</span><br />
Displays the Subtotal + anticipate Tax (if calculated),</p>
<h3>5.4.2 Registry to Disable Summary Tab</h3>
<p>This tab may be disabled via the following registry if the cost summary should not be displayed for security reasons. When this registry is in place, the Main tab will be displayed, but the Summary tab will not.</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: bold;">Id:</span> sys-viewer-vinvntryrcpt</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: bold;">Setting Key:</span> ParentTabs <span style="font-weight: bold;">&#160;Setting Value:</span> Main</p>
<h3>5.4.3 Re-Receiving a Serialized Item</h3>
<p>In previous releases, if a serialized item was received and then unreceived, its serial number could not be reused. In this release, the following procedure may be employed to re-receive a serialized item:</p>
<p>1. Access the View Lot Master record for the serialized item to be re-received.</p>
<p style="margin-left: 48px;">Verify that the Quantity on Hand = 0.</p>
<p style="margin-left: 48px;">Change the Lot Status to Reuse S/N.</p>
<p style="margin-left: 48px;">Save the record.</p>
<p>2. Create a new Inventory Receipt entry to re-receive the item. You will be warned that the serial number already existed but you will be allowed to save the Inventory Receipt.</p>
<h2>5.5 Start Inventory Item Cost Update</h2>
<p>Previously, the confirmation box included box a Yes and a No button. This has been changed to a confirmation box with just an OK button to avoid confusion.</p>
<h2>5.6 &#160;Inventory Physical Count Processing</h2>
<p>The Inventory module must be enabled in order to access View Inventory Physical Count. &#160;</p>
<p>Security is assigned to Inventory History records when Intercompany is enabled. This ensures that Fill Backorders finds the correct parts when running under Intercompany.</p>
<p>The Inventory Physical Count Excel export now includes the Unit of Measure. This change does not effect the import process, so that spreadsheets created before this version may still be imported successfully.</p>
<h2>5.7 Inventory Adjustments Journal</h2>
<p>This release corrects a rounding issue that caused the amount expensed/relieved from inventory to differ from Intercompany transactions.</p>
<p>This release tightens Job Cost Category / Job validation for Direct, Indirect, or blank Jobs.</p>
<p>This function now supports the 'creation' of serialized item records (via an Adjustment entry) by Intercompany users. Previously, a spurious "GL Entity is required on From line' message prevented this functionality. &#160;</p>
<p>When Location to Location adjustments are entered, the GL Account and Entity default from the Inventory Item's Group. In this release, the GL Account / Entity is also updated when the user changes the Inventory Id after entering the Locations.</p>
<p>This function now posts the WO reference (when available) to Inventory History. Previously, only the Job Id was posted for Job-Location and Location-Job entries.</p>
<p style="font-weight: bold;"><span style="font-weight: normal;">This release corrects a key is missing error when the Fill Lines Wizard is run with a Job or Work Order specified.</span></p>
<h3>5.7.1 Inventory Tab</h3>
<p style="font-weight: bold;">New Field - UOM:<br />
<span style="font-weight: normal;">Displays the Unit of Measure from the Inventory record.</span></p>
<h2>5.7 &#160;Inventory Restock List Viewer</h2>
<p>This function now sets the Inventory History Security for Intercompany databases. Validation also prevents To and From Locations from being in different Companies.&#160;</p>
<p style="margin-left: 8px;">This release corrects an error when using the List Sort Order RestockListByToByFrom.</p>
<p>This release corrects 'receiver is not a boolean' error which occurred when accessing an existing Inventory Restock record and immediately clicking the Print Pick Ticket button. The Tab order has also been improved.</p>
<p style="font-weight: bold;">Item Tab - New Fields</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: bold;">Stocked:</span><br />
This display field will be checked if the Item is flagged as a Stocked Item.</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: bold;">Reorder Level: &#160;Order Up To:</span><br />
These fields display the current Reorder Level and Order Up To quantities in the Restock To Location.</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: bold;">Inventory Item Name:</span><br />
This display-only field has been added to help users confirm their stocking list.</p>
<h3><span style="font-weight: bold;">5.7.1 Inventory Restock Pick List Report</span></h3>
<p>This report is now ordered by the Bin/Location and then the Inventory Id.</p>
<p>The Transaction Id and Date printed appear on the report header.</p>
<h2>5.8 Inventory Restock Pick List Entry Viewe</h2>
<p>Security is now set as needed to support Intercompany processing.</p>
<p style="font-weight: bold;">Lower Section - New Field</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: bold;">Inventory Item Name:</span><br />
This display-only field has been added to help users confirm their Pick List entry.</p>
<h2>5.9 Inventory Item Stock Status</h2>
<p><span style="font-weight: bold;">Changed Field: Unit Cost (was Average Cost)</span><br />
The Cost displayed has always been based on the Item's Cost Method. The label has been changed to the generic Unit Cost to better reflect this.</p>
<h2>5.10 Start Import IM Adjustments</h2>
<h3>Purpose:</h3>
<p>Used to import Inventory Adjustment entries from a Database table or a csv file. The import file can be created by a custom barcode program that writes to a database table or manually entered in a spreadsheet. &#160;</p>
<h3>Usage:</h3>
<p>When this function is run, the date effective (from the .cvs file or database table) is used to get a valid Accounting Period which includes that date. If no valid Accounting Period is found, &#160;an error message 'Effective date has no valid Accounting Period' is displayed and the adjustment will be rejected.</p>
<h3>Range Screen:</h3>
<p style="font-weight: bold;">Import From: Database - Text CSV File</p>
<p>Choose whether you will be importing from a database table or a csv file.</p>
<p style="margin-left: 48px;">If you choose to import from a table, the checklist will appear with available (unposted) transactions.</p>
<p style="margin-left: 48px;">If you choose to import from a csv file, you will browse and choose the file and the checklist will appear.</p>
<p>Select the transactions to be posted and hit Go.</p>
<p>A message will display when the import is complete. &#160;</p>
<p style="margin-left: 48px;">If there are failed transactions, a file containing those transactions will be created and the location of the file will be displayed in a message box. &#160;The Email-to address define in the registry will also receive an email. &#160;A user needs to go to that file and fix the errors which will be noted in the file.</p>
<p style="margin-left: 48px;">The user should then run the manual function selecting the csv file, and browse to and choose the fixed file.</p>
<p>Start Import IM Adjustments (Automated) may be used to run this function as a scheduled event: &#160;</p>
<h3>Spreadsheet Format:</h3>
<p>The import expects a header row; the file must be comma delimited. The specifications are as follows:</p>

<p><span style="font-weight: bold;">Registry Id:</span> sys-report-rcopinvce &#160;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: bold;">Setting Key:</span> MultipleSalesTaxLines &#160;&#160;&#160;<span style="font-weight: bold;">Setting Value:</span> Yes</p>
<h3>6.1.2 COP Portrait Invoices Only</h3>
<p>A recent internal change caused the portrait orientation option of the COP Invoice to be ignored in sys-printer-rcopinvce unless a default printer is specified.&#160;&#160;Add this option &#160;to the following registry to correct.</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: bold;">Registry Id:</span> sys-printer-<span style="font-weight: bold;">dialog</span>-rcopinvce</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: bold;">Setting Key:</span> orientation &#160;&#160;<span style="font-weight: bold;">Setting Value:</span> 1</p>
<h3>6.1.3 Specify AR Control Account for COP Invoice</h3>

<h2>6.2 Reports</h2>
<h3>6.2.1 <span style="font-weight: bold;">COP Invoices</span></h3>
<p>This release corrects a spurious Runtime error that appeared when launching Report COP Invoice in a database which contained only a single AR Control GL Account.</p>
<h2>6.3 Client Order Viewer</h2>
<h3>6.3.1 Client Order Item Tab</h3>
<h5>Price Codes Using Margins</h5>
<p>The Client Order Item tab now supports Price Codes that specify a Margin. If the selected Site has a Price Code, the system checks to see if it matches one in the Inventory Item Pricing tab. &#160;If there is a match, the COP module will insert the appropriate Margin based on the Price Level specified in the Site when the Inventory Item is selected. When the user enters and tabs out of the Quantity field, the margin will be converted to the appropriate Unit Price based on the cost. If no Price Code is specified in the Inventory Item and/or the Site, the system will use the Unit Prices on the Inventory Item Pricing /Costing header tab instead.</p>

<h2>7.2 Accounts Receivable Reports</h2>
<h3>7.2.1 Report AR Aging</h3>
<p>The DARAGE report (drill down aging) currently uses the Branch specified in the Client Site (of the COP order) for filtering COP orders. The revised report date 2017-09-19 uses the branch specified in the COP order itself and if blank steps defers to the Branch specified in the Site.</p>
<p>The revised report dated 2017-09-18 now includes logic to get the customer's PO# from the Job if PO is blank in Invoice Master or on the Work Order. This corrects a problem where the PO# was not always shown for RININV3 Invoices.</p>
<p>The revised Report AR Aging (DARAGE.rpt) dated 2016-04-05 now gets the PO from the Work Order if the PO is blank in the invoice. It also supports the following enhancements:</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: bold;">New Option:</span> Show Collection Notes</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: bold;">New Option: Age By - Invoice Date - Date Due</span><br />
Previously, this report always aged by the Invoice Date. &#160;The user may now select the option to age by the Date Due instead.</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: bold;">New Range: GL Entity Id</span><br />
This range allows the user to filter within AR Control Accounts</p>
<h3>7.2.2 Report Customer Statement &#160;(RCUSTSTMNTv80b048.rpt)</h3>
<p><span style="font-weight: bold;">New Field: Print Statements With Balance Over<br /></span>The revised report dated 2017-11-15&#160;replaces the Print Zero Balance Statements option with a Print Statements With Balance Over option. By default, this field is blank (zero) so that only positive balance statements will be generated. If a user wants to include zero balance statements they would enter $.01- in the Print Statements with Balance Order field. If a user wants to include credit balance statements they would enter $99999.99- (or some negative value) in the new input field.</p>
<h5>7.2.2a Include PDF'd Invoices</h5>
<p>The report dated 2016-04-21 and later supports an option to include the PDF'd invoices referenced on the statement as part the PDF version of the statement report. Both job/service based invoices (document category INVOICE) and COP Invoices (document category COPINVOICE) will be included.</p>
<p>If invoices were not originally saved as PDF's, the Start Document Archive Maintenance function may be used to convert these document types to PDF.</p>
<p style="margin-left: 48px;"><span style="font-weight: bold;">Important: &#160;Only the PDF'd Statement Includes the Attachments<br /></span>The .dbr version of the Customer Statement will not display the attached invoices; it will however include a list of attached files. Only the PDF'd version of this report will include the 'package' of invoice attachments.</p>
<p style="margin-left: 8px; font-weight: bold;">Required File:</p>
<p style="margin-left: 8px;">A whitesquare.bmp file (available from support) should be added to the directory where your bitmap graphics are stored.</p>
<p style="margin-left: 8px; font-weight: bold;">Required Registry:</p>
<p style="margin-left: 8px;"><span style="font-weight: bold;">Id:</span> sys-report-rcuststmnt &#160;</p>

<p style="margin-left: 8px;">This option is required to implement the new ' invoice package' functionality.</p>
<p style="margin-left: 8px;"><span style="font-weight: bold;">Setting Key:</span> sectionbackerbitmap &#160;&#160;<span style="font-weight: bold;">Setting Value:</span> <span style="font-style: italic;"><i>Pathname</i></span>\whitesquare.bmp</p>
<p style="margin-left: 8px;">This registry is recommended to prevent the invoice bitmap from 'stepping on' the attached documents. The bitmap may be obtained from support. Note that ONLY the bmp version of this file should be installed.</p>
<p style="margin-left: 8px; font-weight: bold;">Additional Registries:</p>
<p style="margin-left: 8px;">These reports support auto emailing. &#160;The appropriate registry entries should be made to implement this functionality if invoice documents are included:</p>

<p>The revised report dated 2016-08-15 includes the following new features:</p>
<p style="font-weight: bold;">New Field: Print Zero Balance Statements?<br />
<span style="font-weight: normal;">Flagging this field enables the user to print a zero balance statement for the selected client or clients on this report.</span> &#160;<b><span style="font-weight: normal;">Clients with a total outstanding dollar balance in AR History equal to zero will be included on the report, subject to the setting of the other ranges.</span></b></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: bold;">New Range: Client Status</span><br />
This field defaults to Active so to limit this reports to Client with an Active status. It is recommended that this range remains set to Active if the Print Zero Balance Statements? field is flagged. Setting the Range to Active,Credit Hold will include both Active Customers and those on Credit Hold on the report.</p>
<p>There is a registry associated with this report that controls the text that appears when a zero balance statement shows on the report. By default, 'Zero Dollar Statement' will appear. The following registry overrides this default.</p>

<p>This release tightens Job Cost Category / Job validation for Direct, Indirect, or blank Jobs.</p>
<p>The 'Receipts Entered' field is correctly updated when lines on the Other Tab are added or deleted.</p>
<p>Tab Mismatch functionality has been added to this journal to prevent double posting. This could occur in previous releases if a Share Violation was encountered when Quick Attaching files allowing the journal to be saved twice.</p>
<p>This journal checks to see if an entry has been deposited when determining if it can be edited. Validation now supports a recent enhancement where edited Bank Deposit transactions are saved with a tack number appended to their Transaction Id. if a previously selected Cash Receipt is cleared when a Bank Deposit Journal is edited, the cleared Cash Receipt entry may be changed. In this release, the update from the Cash Receipt is applied selectively so that previously changed Bank Deposit lines are not changed.</p>
<p>Previously, when applying a cash receipt amount <strong>less</strong> than invoiced the system displayed the message 'Applied Payment <strong>exceeds</strong> the Amount Owed.' This spurious message has been eliminated. &#160;</p>

<p><span id="BugEvents4">1. To enable this functionality in SAMPro, you must first set up an account with Electronic Payments. Once you have done an API Key and PIN number must be generated for when you set up your SAMPro registries.</span></p>
<p>Instructions for generating an API PIN/Key:</p>
<p style="margin-left: 48px;">Log into EP's customer merchant console (Vault Gateway).<br />
Under Settings, click API Keys (If API Keys option is missing, contact EPI support).<br />
Click Add API Key on upper right.<br />
Name = Databasics<br />
PIN = any random 4 digit key you feel like typing (remember this for registry)<br />
Click Save on lower right. After saving, it will auto-generate an API Key. Use this for the registry.</p>
<p><span>2. &#160;SamproSecureCommunication.war must be installed in Glassfish to enable this functionality. If your firm does not already have a Glassfish server installed (for DBAnalytics or TechAnywhere) contact your support representative to set this up.</span></p>
<p><span>3. I</span>t is recommended that you create a new Payment Type record with the Id set to EPCreditCard and the GL Bank Account set to the appropriate bank or sweep account for Electronic Payments. This will be used for recurring payment processing.</p>
<p><span>4. Complete the registry entries listed below.</span></p>
<p><span>5. We recommend testing this functionality in your sandbox first. When you go life with this functionality, test with a company credit card before using for customers.</span></p>

<h3>7.7.3 Client Site Viewer - Generating a Payment Alias for PM Work Orders</h3>
<p><img src="PaymentAlias.bmp" alt="" style="border: none;" border="0" /></p>
<p>This button establishes a Payment Alias with OpenEdge <span>or Electronic Payments</span> if this functionality is implemented in your system. &#160;&#160;This Alias will be used when PM Invoices are generated to automatically bill the customer's credit card. The system will post successfully paid billings to the Sales Journal as paid and generate the appropriate AR Cash Receipts Journal Entry. The Alias may be set in the Client Site record or the Master Contract Site List tab.</p>
<h5>Electronic Payments</h5>
<p style="margin-left: 48px;">1.Verify that the customer has their credit card ready, and then click this button to enter the customer's credit card information.</p>
<p style="margin-left: 48px;">2.

<p style="margin-left: 48px;">4. When the card is approved, the system will write the Alias back to the Payment Alias field, and complete the CC Masked Account and Expiration Date fields for future reference. A secure note detailing the transaction will be attached to the Master Contract record.</p>
<p style="margin-left: 48px;">5. Save the Client Site.</p>
<p style="font-weight: bold;"><span>Payment Alias:<br /></span><span id="BugEvents1131" style="font-weight: normal;">This field is completed by the system when a Payment Alias is successfully generated by OpenEdge or Electronic Payments via the Payment Alias button. The Payment Alias may be cleared by manually by blanking the field. This would be done if the client changed their mind and did not wish to have their recurring PM's paid via credit card. Validation also prevents the user from manually changing this field to a non-blank value; this field may only be set via the Payment Alias button.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: bold;">CC Masked Account (first four and last four digits of the credit card)<br />
CC Expiration Date &#160;CC Trx Id:</span><br />

<h2>8.2 Reports</h2>
<h3>8.2.1 Enhanced Report Progress Invoice Template 3</h3>
<p>The revised report (RINIVNV3.rpt) dated 2017-08-013 adds the Site Address to the right-hand side of the CANADA header format. The box around the header information has been removed for a sleeker appearance.</p>
<p>The revised report dated 2016-05-12 was enhanced to show billed retainage as a positive number with the label 'Billed Retainage'. &#160;In previous versions of this report, billed retainage was shown as a negative value, with the label 'Less Retainage'.</p>
<p>This report also supports a registry option to override the 'Billed Retainage' label.</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: bold;">Id:</span> sys-report-rininv3</p>

<h3>8.2.1a Specify Report Progress Invoice Template 2 Bitmap Override by Job</h3>
<p>The revised Progress Invoice (RININV3.rpt) dated 2018-05-14 supports the new bitmap override by Job functionality.</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: bold;">Registry Id:</span> sys-report-rininv3</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: bold;">Setting Key:</span> &#160;BitmapOverrideBasedOn &#160;&#160;<span style="font-weight: bold;">Setting Value:</span> job</p>
<p>This registry entry defines that this override is based on a user field in the invoice's Job record.</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: bold;">Setting Key:</span> BitmapOverrideField&#160;&#160;<span style="font-weight: bold;">Setting Value:</span> <span style="font-style: italic;"><i>job user database field</i></span></p>
<p>This registry entry specifies exactly Job User field will provide the override; the database field name must be specified. For example, the following specifies the Job's User 3 field:</p>
<p style="margin-left: 48px;">Setting Key: BitmapOverrideField&#160;&#160;Setting Value: jb_usr3</p>
<p style="margin-left: 8px;"><span style="font-weight: bold;">Setting Key:</span> Job~<span style="font-style: italic;"><i>string</i></span> &#160;&#160;<span style="font-weight: bold;">Setting Value:</span> <span style="font-style: italic;"><i>path\bitmap.</i></span>bmp</p>
<p style="margin-left: 8px;">This entry provide the override bitmap file that will be used if the Job record's User field defined above contains the string specified. &#160;Notice that a tilde (~) separates Job from the string. As many of these entries may be made as needed to support the various bitmaps.</p>
<p style="margin-left: 48px;">Example:</p>
<p style="margin-left: 48px;">Suppose that we have a bitmap file named 010101_invoice.bmp that should be used on invoices associated with Job's having the following text string 010101 in Job User 3 fields.</p>
<p style="margin-left: 48px;">Setting Key: Job~010101 &#160;Setting Value: <span style="font-style: italic;"><i>path\</i></span>010101_invoice.bmp</p>
<p style="margin-left: 8px;"><span style="font-weight: bold;">Tip:</span> Include the part of the bitmap name as the text string for clarity.</p>
<p style="margin-left: 8px;"><span style="font-weight: bold;">Tip:</span> Including the appropriate values in your job templates will ensure that new jobs are created properly. In addition, using the Custom Fields functionality to specify the allowed values will prevent inappropriate values from being entered.</p>
<h3>8.2.2 Service Invoice</h3>
<p><span style="font-weight: bold;">Revised Report: Service Invoice</span><br />
Added PO Id to AR Summary section &#160;(SERVICEINVOICEv90b028.rpt revised 2016-04-05).</p>
<p>When Show Equipment Detail is flagged, all 3000 characters of the Equipment Work Requested and Performed are printed (first in SERVICEINVOICEv90_b002.rpt revised 2015-12-19). Previously, only the first 1200 characters were printed.</p>
<p>The revised Service Invoice Report (first in serviceinvoicev90b002.rpt dated 12/17/2014) supports the use of the WO COD tab's new Effective Date field to determine if a COD Payment should be included on an invoice. If the Invoice's Bill Thru Date equals or exceeds the WO COD tab's Effective Date the COD Payment will be applied to the Invoice. &#160;</p>
<p>See Customer Release Note 16.3.9 for details on the new field.</p>
<h3>8.2.2a Service Invoice - Enhancement to Attach TechAnywhere Receipts and Other Documents to Emailed Invoices and to Skip Print Emailed Invoices</h3>
<p>This release adds the ability to append TechAnywhere receipts or other documents to the PDF'd version of Service Invoices. This allows an Invoice Package to be automatically emailed to customers configured to receive Service Invoices via email. Supported document attachment file types include: .bmp, .jpg, .gif, .png, &#160;and .pdf. This functionality is suitable for scenarios where a Work Order is only invoiced once.</p>
<p style="margin-left: 48px;"><span style="font-weight: bold;">Important: &#160;Only the PDF'd Invoice Includes the Attachments<br /></span>The .dbr version of the Service Invoice will not display the attached documents; it will however include a list of attached files. Only the PDF'd version of this document will include the 'package' of document attachments.</p>
<p>To enable this functionality:</p>
<p>1. The revised Service Invoice serviceinvoicev90b028.rpt dated 2017/02/28 or later must be installed in your database. This report also supports logic to process archive file locations when compiling an invoice with attached TechAnywhere Receipts or other files. &#160;</p>
<p>2. The Client Site Email Invoices field (a-clntste: clntste.eml-invce) must contain a list of the Document Categories which should be included in the Invoice Package. The included documents must be attached to the Work Order being invoiced prior to the generation of the invoice. Any documents attached to the Work Order after an invoice is generated will not be included in this package.</p>
<p>For example, to include TechAnywhere Receipts in the Invoice Package for a particular Site, you would enter <span style="font-weight: bold;">Receipt</span> in its Email Invoices field.</p>
<p>3. Verify that the xmlToPdf.jar file (located in the same directory as your SAMPro executable) is dated 2015/07/08 or later.</p>
<p>4. Implement the following registry entries:</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: bold;">Id:</span> sys-start-ssrvcebllngcmpte:</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: bold;">Setting Key:</span> IncludeInvoiceDocuments &#160;&#160;<span style="font-weight: bold;">Setting Value:</span> true &#160;&#160;&#160;(default false)</p>
<p>This option is required to implement the new 'package' functionality.</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: bold;">Setting Key:</span> SkipPrintEmailedInvoices &#160;&#160;<span style="font-weight: bold;">Setting Value:</span> true</p>
<p>Implementing this registry allows emailed invoices to be 'skipped' in the print run. &#160;Processing will proceed as usual: the Invoices will be displayed and sent to the printer; the user must then confirm that the invoices have printed and post them. However, only those invoices that were not emailed will actually be printed.</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: bold;">Id:</span> sys-report-serviceinvoice:</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: bold;">Setting Key:</span> sectionbackerbitmap &#160;&#160;<span style="font-weight: bold;">Setting Value:</span> <span style="font-style: italic;"><i>Pathname</i></span>\whitesquare.bmp</p>
<p>This registry is recommended to prevent the invoice bitmap from 'stepping on' the attached documents. The bitmap may be obtained from support.</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: bold;">Setting Key:</span> ShowDocumentDescription &#160;<span style="font-weight: bold;">Setting Value:</span> Y</p>
<p>This option should be enabled to display the Document Description of the attached graphic document on the upper left-hand corner of the page. Note that the attachments themselves (along with the Description) are only shown when the invoice is PDF'd.</p>

<h2>8.3 Other Rate record</h2>
<p><span style="font-weight: bold;">Changed Field: Unit of Measure</span><br />
Expanded from 5 to 10 characters.</p>
<h2>8.4 Avalara Sales Tax Integration</h2>
<p><span style="font-weight: bold;">IMPORTANT: Avalara Users<br /></span>Formatting configurations within the Avalara import files for certain states may require manual updates to Sales Tax Authorities/Groups following the update. Please contact your support rep before running Start Sales Tax Update (Avalara). <span style="font-weight: bold;"></span>Note that new releases of Version 9.1 support the Avalara Web Service (which does not have these import issues). Upgrading to Version 9.1 also provide preprocessing information on anomalies in the Avalara files which may need to be corrected. <span style="font-weight: bold;">&#160;</span></p>
<h3>8.4.0 Recent Updates</h3>
<p>Formatting configurations within the Avalara import files for certain states may require manual updates to Sales Tax Authorities/Groups following the update. The following enhancements have been made to manage some of the tax anomalies within the Avalara data, and to alert the user to any potential manual changes that may be required.</p>
<p>1. When the Go button is pressed to import an Avalara tax file, validation has been added to show any anomalies in the data about to be imported. When anomalies are found 2 workspaces and a message box will appear. These workspace reports are provided for the users to review the integrity of the data.</p>
<p style="margin-left: 48px;">The first workspace report gives the Authority Id, Tax Type, Tax Rate and Count.&#160;&#160;Count is the number of records found in the Avalara import file for that Authority’s Tax Rate.</p>
<p style="margin-left: 48px;">The second workspace report lists Authority Id, Authority Name, Tax Rate, Tax Type and Signature.&#160;&#160;The signature shows the zip code and Authority Id’s found with a 0% tax rate.&#160;</p>
<p>2. We suggest printing these workspaces before continuing; this will provide you with the information needed if manual adjustments must be made.</p>
<p>3. When the data is imported, if the system finds a state, county or local tax that changes to a zero rate, the system will attempt to create a new tax authorities with a 'z' added to the Id. This will result in a new Sales Tax Group being generated. &#160;These new Sales Tax Groups must be added to Jobs as needed.</p>
<p>This release corrects a sporadic issue where the Sales Tax Authority information was too large to fit in the Tax Info fields on the detail lines of the AP Journal; Inventory Adjustments Journal; Inventory Receipts Journal; Purchase Order; and Work Order viewers. This issue emerged when updated Tax Group included zero rate Authorities.</p>
<p>In previous releases, updating existing Sales Tax Authorities / Groups from Alavara ignored updates where the Sales Rate was changed to zero because zero tax rate Authorities were ignored. &#160;In this release, zero tax rates updates are properly accounted for when Tax Group records are updated. However, as a result of this change, updated and newly processed Tax Groups will include Tax Authority records with zero tax rates if applicable.</p>
<p style="margin-left: 48px;">WARNING: Do Not Filter the Avalara Update<br />
If you filter your Avalara update to a specific Zip Code, only that Sales Tax Group would have its Sales Tax Group Rate recalculated. If the update to that Group included changes to rates also impacting other Group (e.g., the State Rate rate), the applicable Tax Authority would be updated, but the other Tax Groups referencing it would not have their Group Tax Rates reset. This is a particular problem since TechAnywhere uses the Group Tax Rate. For this reason, we strongly recommend that you allow your Avalara updates to run wide open so that all applicable Sales Tax Groups will be properly updated.</p>
<h3>8.4.1 Overview</h3>
<p>Avalara provides Sale Tax information which may be imported to populate SAMPro's Sales Tax Groups and Authorities. Executing the Import process reads properly formatted data from a text file into the new SAMPro Avalara Sales Tax table. &#160;It will create new records and update existing records.</p>
<p>The Tax Group Id is based on the Zip Code for imported data. &#160;However, since a single zip code may encompass more than one Sales Tax Group (which specifies the State, County and Municipal / Other Authorities), the Sales Tax Group Id of records generated by running the Start Sales Tax Update will be composed of the Zip Code optionally followed by a .### extension. For example, the Sales Tax Authority with the name "ARVADA JEFFERSON CO COLORADO 80002" is assigned the Id 80002.002 to distinguish it from "DENVER JEFFERSON CO COLORADO 80002" with Id 80002.004. In addition, Use Tax and non Use Tax groups are created.</p>
<p>The Site's City, State and Zip have been added to the Job record to make it easier to select the correct Sales Tax Group.</p>
<h3>8.4.2a Registry for Start Sales Tax Update (Avalara)</h3>
<p><span style="font-weight: bold;">Id:</span> sys-start-sslstxupdte</p>
<h5>Set the Labor Tax Selection by State</h5>
<p>The following registry setting can be used to set state-specific rules for Labor. This registry setting trumps the user input in the Labor Tax Selection field of the starter function.</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: bold;">Setting Key:</span> <span style="font-style: italic;"><i>stateid</i></span>~TaxLaborSelect &#160;&#160;<span style="font-weight: bold;">Setting Value:</span> &#160;Tax Labor or Use AvalaraRule</p>
<p style="margin-left: 48px;">If there is no registry entry (or if the Setting Value is Use AvalaraRule) the system will use the Avalara Rules to determine if Labor is taxable when the Tax Group is generated.</p>
<p style="margin-left: 48px;">If the Setting Value of Tax Labor is implemented, the Tax Labor flag will be set in the Sales Tax Group. Note that there is a space between Sales and Tax in the Setting Value.</p>
<p style="margin-left: 48px;">If there is a registry setting that has the setting value of ANYTHING other than "Tax Labor" or "Use AvalaraRule", it will NOT set the Tax Labor on the Group.</p>
<h5>Specify Tax Rules by State</h5>
<p>The following settings may be used to specify the tax rules by state for Tax Groups generated by Avalara. &#160;These registry settings trump the input options on the start function.</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: bold;">Setting Key:</span> <span style="font-style: italic;"><i>stateid</i></span>~TaxSubcontract &#160;&#160;<span style="font-weight: bold;">Setting Value:</span> &#160;Y or &#160;N</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: bold;">Setting Key:</span> <span style="font-style: italic;"><i>stateid</i></span>~TaxMaterial &#160;&#160;<span style="font-weight: bold;">Setting Value:</span> &#160;Y or &#160;N</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: bold;">Setting Key:</span> <span style="font-style: italic;"><i>stateid</i></span>~TaxOther &#160;&#160;<span style="font-weight: bold;">Setting Value:</span> &#160;Y or &#160;N</p>
<p style="margin-left: 48px;">Example: (for California)<br />
Setting Key: CA~TaxSubcontract &#160;&#160;Setting Value: Y</p>
<h5>Specify GL Account by State</h5>
<p>This setting allows you to specify the Tax Authority's sales tax liability account to be credited.</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: bold;">Setting Key:</span> <span style="font-style: italic;"><i>stateid</i></span>~GLAccount &#160;&#160;<span style="font-weight: bold;">Setting Value:</span> <span style="font-style: italic;"><i>GL Account Id</i></span></p>
<p style="margin-left: 48px;">Example (for California)<br />
Setting Key: &#160;CA~GLAccount &#160;&#160;Setting Value: 5100</p>
<h3>8.4.2b Registry for Sales Tax Authorities</h3>

<h3>8.4.3 New Viewer: Avalara Sales Tax Data</h3>
<p>This viewer displays the Sales Tax Data imported via the Start Sales Tax Update (Avalara) function. &#160;</p>
<h3>8.4.4 Start Sales Tax Update (Avalara)</h3>
<h5>Purpose:</h5>
<p>This function enables the user to create and update SAMPro Sales Tax Groups and Authorities from Avalara's database as delivered in a text file. Note that the Tax Flags will be set in the Sales Tax Group records, NOT the Sales Tax Authorities. &#160;The Authority Rules flags are not set in the Sales Tax Authorities.</p>
<h5>Usage:</h5>
<h5>To Import an Avalara File:</h5>
<p><img src="Import_Sales_Tax_CSV.bmp" alt="" style="border: none;" border="0" /></p>
<p>1. Click the Import Sales Tax CSV button. When you do so, a browse window will open. &#160;Browse to the location your Avalara CSV or TXT files are stored.</p>
<p>2. Select a file to import. &#160;When you do so, the data will be imported. &#160;This may take a few minutes. When the Import is complete, &#160;A workspace will open with a log file of your import results; this may be closed or saved.</p>
<h5>To Create / Update Sales Tax Authorities/Groups</h5>
<p>Importing the Avalara data does NOT generate / update the Sales Tax Authority and Groups in SAM Pro. &#160;To do so, complete the appropriate fields and then click the Go button.</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: bold;">Last Updated:</span><br />
Avalara provides a 'Last Updated' date for each row in the import files they provide. When the starter function is run to update the Groups and Authorities, Avalara records whose Last Update Date is less than this field will be skipped. &#160;To that ensure all Groups and Authorities are updated leave this field blank.</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: bold;">GL Account Id:</span><br />
This field specifies the GL Account to be used in Tax Authority records created from Avalara data. This field will be overridden by the stateid~GLAccount registry option if implemented.</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: bold;">Tax Material?</span><br />
This fields controls how the Tax Material? field in the Sales Tax Groups will be set. &#160;This field will be overridden by the stateid~TaxMaterial registry option if implemented.</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: bold;">Tax Other?</span><br />
This fields controls how the Tax Other? field in the Sales Tax Groups updated by this function will be set. &#160;This field will be overridden by the stateid~TaxOther registry option if implemented.</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: bold;">Tax Subcontract?</span><br />
This fields controls how the Tax Subcontract? field will be set in Sales Tax Groups updated by this function. &#160;This field will be overridden by the stateid~TaxSubcontract registry option if implemented.</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: bold;">Labor Tax Selection:</span> <span style="font-weight: bold;">o Use Avalara Rule &#160;o Tax Labor &#160;o Don't Tax Labor<br /></span>This field controls whether or not Labor will be flagged as Taxable in Sales Tax Groups updated by this function.</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: bold;">State:</span> &#160;<br />
We recommend completing the State range (with the appropriate 2-character State code); running the function wide open can take considerable time.</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: bold;">Zip Code: &#160;County Name: &#160;City Name:</span><br />
Enter one or more of these ranges to limit the update to the specified Avalara data only if you are sure the authorities updated are limited to the ranges specified.</p>
<p style="margin-left: 48px;"><span style="font-weight: bold;">WARNING: Do Not Filter the Avalara Update</span><br />
If you filter your Avalara update to a specific Zip Code, only that Sales Tax Group would have its Sales Tax Group Rate recalculated. If the update to that Group included changes to rates also impacting other Group (e.g., the State Rate rate), the applicable Tax Authority would be updated, but the other Tax Groups referencing it would not have their Group Tax Rates reset. This is a particular problem since TechAnywhere uses the Group Tax Rate. For this reason, we strongly recommend that you allow your Avalara updates to run wide open so that all applicable Sales Tax Groups will be properly updated.</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: bold;">Always Create Separate Use Tax Groups?</span><br />
Flag this box if separate Sales and Use Tax groups should be always be generated, even if the Sales and Use Tax rates are the same. &#160;The Use Tax groups will specify (Use Tax) at the end of the Sales Tax Group Name.<br />
<br />
<span style="font-weight: bold;">Job Cost Use Tax Group Authorities?</span><br />
Flag this field if the Job Cost? box should be flagged for all Authorities in each Use Tax Group. If this box is flagged, the system will assume that Always Create Use Tax Groups is also flagged to avoid undesirable results.</p>
<p><img src="image/SKIN1_Go.gif" alt="" style="border: none;" border="0" /> &#160;Click the Go button to create/update Sale Tax Authority and Group records in SAMPro from the current Avalara Sales Tax data.</p>
<h2>8.5 Sales Tax Authority</h2>
<h3>8.5.1 Main Tab</h3>
<p><span style="font-weight: bold;">New Field: GL Expense Account</span><br />
This field specifies the Expense Account for sales taxes paid.&#160;If completed, it will be debited in the AP Journal for sales taxes paid. &#160;If this field is not completed, the system will continue to use the Sale Tax Authority's GL Account (Liability) to post a debit to the associated account.&#160;This will preserve prior installations where 2 authorities would be set up (one for Sales taxes collected and one specific for AP for sales taxes paid).&#160;&#160;These users could migrate to the new design with little or no impact.</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: bold;">New Fields: Imported From: &#160;Last Updated: &#160;Signature Code:</span><br />
These display field will be completed if this Sales Tax Authority was imported/updated; currently Avalara imports are supported. &#160;The Last Update date specifies when the Avalara file was lasted updated for this Sales Tax Authority. The Signature Code is from the Avalara import file; in most cases, it will be the same as the Sale Tax Authority Id.</p>
<h3>8.5.2 Sales Tax Authority GL Entities</h3>
<p>The system now incorporates Sales Tax Authority GL Entities into credit-side tax cost processing when the GL Entity is not set from other sources.</p>
<p style="margin-left: 48px;"><span style="font-weight: bold;">Purchase Order Inventory and General lines:</span><br />
Now uses GL Entity from the PO parent when available, otherwise from Tax Authority. Previously, only the PO parent's GL Entity was considered.</p>
<p style="margin-left: 48px;"><span style="font-weight: bold;">AP Journal: All child lines</span><br />
Now uses GL Entity from the AP parent when available, otherwise from Tax Authority. Previously, only the AP parent's GL Entity was considered.</p>
<p style="margin-left: 48px;"><span style="font-weight: bold;">Inventory Adjustment Journal:</span><br />
Now uses GL Entity from the parent when available, otherwise from Tax Authority. Previously, tax costs from To/From used the associated Company Balance Sheet GL Entity. &#160;</p>
<p style="margin-left: 48px;"><span style="font-weight: bold;">Work Order Inventory / Other Lines</span><br />
The system now uses the GL Entity from the Tax Authority when not supplied by other defaults (e.g., Company Balance Sheet GL Entity).</p>
<p style="margin-left: 48px;"><span style="font-weight: bold;">Work Order Entry</span><br />
The system now uses the GL Entity from the Tax Authority when not supplied by other defaults (e.g., Company Balance Sheet GL Entity).</p>
<p style="margin-left: 48px;"><span style="font-weight: bold;">Inventory Receipt Journal</span><br />
The system now uses the GL Entity from the Tax Authority when not supplied by other defaults.</p>
<h2>8.6 Sales Tax Group</h2>
<h3>8.6.1 Tax Authorities Tab</h3>
<p>A new index has been added to this table to require that a specific Sales Tax Authority can appear no more that once in the same Sales Tax Group. The system will display a 'Child Row Update Failed' error if a user attempts of add the same Sales Tax Authority more than once in the Group. &#160;This error will also appear doing a data import.</p>
<h3>8.6.2 Parent Screen</h3>
<p><span style="font-weight: bold;">New Fields: Imported From: &#160;Last Updated: &#160;Group Signature:</span><br />
These display field will be completed if this Sales Tax Group was generated from imported data; currently Avalara imports are supported. &#160;The Last Update date specifies when the Avalara file was lasted updated for this Sales Tax Group. The Group Signature identifies the Zip Code plus municipal Authority included in this Group.</p>
<h2>8.7 Material Revenue Calculations (all viewers)</h2>
<p>Version 9.0 implements a refinement to the methodology for computing a revenue rate markup based on unit cost; it also implements options for 'margin' and 'multiplier' calculations.</p>
<p style="margin-left: 48px;"><span style="font-weight: bold;">IMPORTANT: Contractual Rates</span><br />
While the new default calculates provide more refined revenue calculations, this change may cause issues Client-specific material markup rates that are contractual are specified. In this case, maintaining the previous methodology (via registry) may be advisable.</p>
<h3>8.7.1 Material Rate Table - Aggregate Level Markup</h3>
<p>In previous versions, materials markup always calculated as the cost plus markup without considering any lower cost levels. However, this could result in pricing inconsistencies. For example, suppose a $5 item is marked up 700%.&#160;&#160;The charge to the customer would be the cost of $5.00 plus a $35 mark-up or $40. But suppose that an item that costs $6.00 has a 400% mark-up.&#160;&#160;In this case, the price would be the cost of $6.00 plus a $24 mark-up resulting in a price of $30 (or $5.00 less than the cheaper item).</p>
<p>In Version 9.0, the default code used to calculate the price has been refined to take the previous level into account when doing the calculation resulting in a graduated price structure.&#160;Under the new methodology, a $6.00 item would be marked up as follows:</p>
<p style="margin-left: 48px;">First level (700% rate up to 5.00 level): $5.00 plus a $35 markup = $40.00</p>
<p style="margin-left: 48px;">Second level (400% rate above 5.00 &amp; up to 10.00 level): $1.00 plus a $4.00 markup =$5.00</p>
<p style="margin-left: 48px;">Total graduated price: $40.00 (for the first level) + $5.00 (for the second level) = <span style="font-weight: bold;">$45.00</span></p>
<p>Two new display-only columns, &#160;Unit Price Min and Unit Price Max have been added to the Material Rate Table. The following illustration shows the new methodology where the Unit Price Min on the second line is forced to the Unit Price Max from the previous line in the new, aggregated approach. &#160;</p>
<p class="Support" style="margin-left: 48px;"><img src="MatRateNew.jpg" alt="" style="border: none;" width="561" height="307" border="0" /><br /></p>
<p>Under the OLD Methodology (now enabled via registry) notice that the Unit Price Max of the first line exceeds the Unit Price Min of the second line - leading to inconsistencies in pricing near the price break.</p>
<p class="Support" style="margin-left: 48px;"><img src="MatRateOld.jpg" alt="" style="border: none;" width="576" height="313" border="0" /></p>
<p class="Support" style="margin-left: 48px;">&#160;</p>
<p>The following illustration provides a real-life example of the old and new methods:</p>
<p><img src="markupexample.png" alt="" style="border: none;" border="0" /></p>
<h3>8.7.2 Registry To Default to Non-Aggregate Markup</h3>
<p>The new methodology is the default in version 9.0. &#160;To return to the old methodology, the following registry entry is required. Note that this registry also impacts how the Material Rate Types of Margin and Multiplier are handled.</p>
<p>Registry Id: sys-ffv-global-settings</p>
<p>Setting Key: MaterialMarkupMethod &#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;Setting Value: old</p>
<h3>8.7.3 &#160;New Material Rate Types of Margin or Multiplier</h3>
<p style="font-weight: bold;">New Field: &#160;Material Rate Type: &#160;Margin - Multiplier</p>
<p>In previous releases, the Material Rate Table only supported Markups (cost plus markup). In Version 9.0, Material Rate Tables converted from version 8.2 (and before) will be assigned the Material Rate Type of Markup to support previous behavior. &#160;</p>
<p>The following types are also available:</p>
<p style="margin-left: 48px;">Selecting <font style="font-weight: bold;">Margin</font> enables the user to set the desired profit margin ((Unit Price - Unit )/Unit Price) for this item in the Rate field (entered as a percentage). &#160;Validation ensures that the Rate must be less than 100 for tables with the Material Rate Type set to Margin. The following shows the Margin equivalent of the previous Markup table (using the new methodology).</p>
<p class="Support" style="margin-left: 48px;"><img src="margin.jpg" alt="" style="border: none;" width="602" height="323" border="0" /></p>
<p style="margin-left: 48px;">If you select <font style="font-weight: bold;">Multiplier</font>, the system will multiply the Rate X Unit Cost to obtain the Unit Price. For example, a multiplier of 1.2 applied to a cost of $100 would yield a unit price of $120.</p>
<p>Note that both Margin and Multiplier are also 'smoothed' so that the Unit Price Max of the first line is forced to equal the Unit Price Min of the second line <span style="text-decoration: underline;"><u>unless</u></span> the sys-ffv-global-settings MaterialMarkupMethod option is set to old.</p>
<h3>8.7.4 All Viewers with Inventory/Material Entry</h3>
<p><span style="font-weight: bold;">Changed Field - Bill Type Id:</span><br />
If the new markup methodology is in effect this field will be set to Unit Price because the price calculation is the result of an aggregate calculation. If the old markup methodology is in effect this field will be set to the applicable value (margin, markup or multiplier). See Customer Note 8.3 for details. As in previous versions, this field will also be set to Unit Price if the Inventory Item's Use Price Levels? field is flagged.</p>
<h2>8.8 Create PM Billing</h2>
<p>In previous releases, this function skipped all Sites flagged as Inactive, and did not consider the Date Closed (which could be in the future). In this release, this validation is refined so that Site with a future Date Closed will not be skipped when this function is run, even if it is flagged as Inactive.</p>
<h2>8.9 Compute Service Invoice</h2>
<p>This release corrects an issue with reversal Job History lines if a user attempted to edit a previously invoiced line. This could result in a negative 'ghost' line on the second or third invoice for that Work Order.</p>
<p>This release corrects sporadic 'key is missing' errors when invoicing COD Work Orders.</p>
<p>For Warranty Jobs, the Tax Group may be determined from the Site's COP tab instead of the Job itself, In previous releases, the Tax History did not have the Tax Group completed, and Tax reports were missing these invoices. This release corrects this problem.</p>
<h3>8.9.1 Compute Service Invoice Checklist</h3>
<p>Potentially out-of-balance Cash Receipts / AR Sales $0.00 Entries will appear on the Checklist but cannot be checked for processing; a workspace warning message also be displayed.</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: bold;">New Field: Skip Print Invoice</span><br />
This field will be flagged if this invoice will be emailed AND the new functionality to skip print emailed invoices (see Customer Note 8.2.2a) is enabled via registry.</p>
<h2>8.10 Rate Schedule Viewer</h2>
<p style="font-weight: bold;"><span style="font-weight: normal;">When the Rate Schedule is saved, the detail lines are now re-ordered with the most recent entries at the top. Enhanced validation prevents overlapping date ranges and gaps which cause undesirable results when SAMPro attempts to determine which line of the Rate Schedule to use.</span></p>
<h3>8.11 Record Billing Adjustments</h3>
<p>This release corrects a sporadic problem where the Tax Base on the Taxes tab did not match the Computed Tax Base on the Main tab due to negative revenue lines on the Other/Lab tabs not accumulating correctly.</p>
<p>This release corrects a very sporadic Runtime error: "containsPoint:" not understood.</p>
<p>In Version 9.0.572.034-049, when you clicked the Save button in Record Billing Adjustments the function restarted at the Job Id input screen. In this release, the default is NOT to restart the function. See Customer Note 8.1.4 for a registry to automatically restart Record Billing Adjustments.</p>
<h3>8.11.1 Sales / Use Tax Validation</h3>
<p>Validation has been extended to warn the user if Exempt (as well as Sales or Use Tax) Jobs have not had their Sales Tax computed when the invoice is set / saved as Ready to Print. &#160;The following warning will be displayed if an invoice is saved as Ready To Print if there is a Next Invoice Amount but the Taxes tab is blank.</p>
<p style="margin-left: 48px;">Warning: Compute Sales Tax has not been Pressed.</p>
<p style="margin-left: 48px;">Ok to continue?</p>
<p style="margin-left: 8px;">Click No to return to Record Billing Adjustments to click Compute Sales Tax before saving. If you click Yes to continue, the appropriate entries will NOT be made to the Sales Tax Table which is used for Sales Tax reporting.</p>
<h2>8.12 Reverse Job Invoice</h2>
<p style="font-weight: normal;">In this release, the WO COD Tab's Invoice Reference is cleared during Start Job Invoice Reverse process. This allows the user to edit the Work Order's COD child tab if needed before re-billing the Work Order.</p>
<p style="font-weight: normal;"><span style="font-weight: bold;">T</span>his release corrects a spurious SQL error &#160;(invalid object name 'FMMSInfo') which occurred if data was initially converted to V9.0 on 9.0.572.030 or earlier and the table expected by the function was not found. &#160;</p>
<h2>8.13 Start Resend Emailed Invoices</h2>
<p style="font-weight: bold;">New features: Range Screen</p>
<p>The user is now warned if both of the date ranges are blank.</p>
<p style="font-weight: bold;">New Option: Skip Paid Invoices<br />
<span style="font-weight: normal;">When this box is checked, only invoices with unpaid balances will appear on the checklist.</span>&#160;&#160;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: bold;">New feature: Checklist</span><br />
The Email To field on the list screen has been opened, allowing the email address to be changed if needed.</p>
<h1>9 Job / Job Costing</h1>
<h2>9.1 Job Related Registries</h2>
<h3>9.1.1 Registry to Refine Job Costing for Labor</h3>
<p>A new methodology (enabled via registry) is available to keep wage and non-wage hourly-type amounts separately so that percent-type cost lines can be applied to wages only. This registry is also required to Job Cost Pay Rate Adjustments on the Job's Employee Overrides tab. &#160;</p>
<p>See Customer Release Note 12.1.2 for details. &#160;</p>
<h3>9.1.2 Change to Auto-Numbering via Job Sequence Field</h3>
<p>If enabled, the registry key JobSequenceField=true in sys-viewer-vjb determines which field in the Job record contains the mask for auto-number job id's when using the Job Clone function. In previous releases, it was an all or nothing feature meaning if you made the registry setting ALL jobs must auto-number.</p>
<p>In this release, if the JobSequenceField registry exists AND the job template you are cloning from has a mask in the specified field, the system will continue to auto-number as before. However, if the Job / Job Template DOES NOT have a mask in the specified field, then the user should manually set the Job Id in the Job Clone wizard.</p>
<h3>9.1.3 Job Journal Registry To Require Net Zero Costing on Co.Equip Tab</h3>
<p><span style="font-weight: bold;">Id:</span> sys-viewer-vjbjrnl</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: bold;">Setting Key:</span> NetZeroEquipmentCost &#160;&#160;<span style="font-weight: bold;">Setting Value:</span> true &#160;&#160;(default false)</p>
<p>This registry impacts the Job Journal's Co.Equip tab which is used to charge company equipment assets to a Job or Work Order. When enabled, this registry requires that the costs entered on the Co.Equip tab net to zero. This entry provides a means of controlling job cost transfers.</p>
<h3>9.1.4 Report Job Detail Registry to Suppress Labor Costs</h3>
<p>This option suppresses labor costs on the details lines. This registry is available in the report dated 2011-10-27 but was not previously documented.</p>

<p>The revised component report CSERPFT1.rpt dated 2016-09-28 corrects an error when drilling down from the Drilldown Service Profitability report.</p>
<h3><span style="font-weight: bold;">9.2.2 Report Job Billing Report (RBLLRPT.rpt)</span></h3>
<p>The revised report (AKA Report Job Billing Recap) dated 2016-03-31 supports Security Id processing and corrects an issue which caused it to 'hang' in some environments.</p>
<h3>9.2.3 Report Profitability by Client (DCPFTRv73b029.rpt)</h3>
<p>The revised report dated 2016-10-19 enhances how the billed costs are calculated for the Labor, Material, Other, and Subcontract columns at the Client, Client Site, and Bill Item Summary levels.</p>
<h3><span style="font-weight: bold;">9.2.4 Report Job Cost Details – Direct</span></h3>
<p>This new report (RJBDTLDRCT.rpt dated 2016-01-10) resembles the original Report Job Billing Details but skips all overhead jobs in order to prevent typical users from running the report for indirect overhead jobs and seeing confidential data.</p>
<h3>9.2.5 Report Jobs in Progress</h3>
<p>The revised report (RJBPRGRSS.rpt) dated 2017-03-10) replaces the Over/Under Billed column heading w/ Total Billed JTD - Cost JTD. &#160;For Change Orders (Billing Items with the Change Order? box checked), the report now checks the CO Date Approved when determining whether or not to include the CO Amount in the Total Revised Contract: the CO Date Approved must be less than or equal to the report's Ending Date.</p>
<h3>9.2.6 Report WIP Summary 2 (% Completion Method)</h3>
<p>This new report (DWIPSUM2.rpt) dated 2017-03-13 calculates Total Estimated Revenue from the Contract Amounts in the Billing Items. For Change Orders, the Date Change Approved must be less than or equal to the Ending Date for the report.</p>
<h3>9.2.7 Profitability Analysis Report</h3>
<p><span style="font-weight: normal;">The Profitability Analysis Report (RPRFTRPT.rpt) dated 2018-05-15 has been updated to include filtering by the job billing item.

<p style="margin-left: 48px;"><span style="font-weight: bold;">Lien Waiver Req'd?</span><br />
This field should be checked if Lien Waivers are required for this Job. &#160;The field will be displayed in the PO Header and AP Header for any PO's referencing the Job in the header, and subsequent A/P transactions referencing a PO that references the Job. The user will be warned when creating a PO or AP Journal for a Job that requires a Lien Waiver. &#160;The Lien Waiver warning message is silenced then PO Orders referencing a Lien Waiver Job are generated via the Quote and Quote Manager Approval Wizards.</p>
<p style="font-weight: bold; margin-left: 48px;">City &#160;State/Province Zip/Postal Code<br />
<span style="font-weight: normal;">This information defaults from the Site record, and displays just below the Job Tax Status to help with the selection of the correct Sales Tax Group.</span></p>

<p style="margin-left: 48px;"><span style="font-weight: bold;">Job Contact 1 Extension: &#160;&#160;Job Contact 2 Extension:</span><br />
These phone extensions have been expanded to 7 digits.</p>
<p style="margin-left: 8px;"><img src="image/Clone_Job.gif" alt="" style="border: none;" border="0" /> &#160;When records are cloned via the Job's Clone Job button, a record change log entry noting the source record reference info is written to each new record. &#160;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: bold;">Auto Numbering:</span> If enabled, the registry key JobSequenceField=true in sys-viewer-vjb determines which field in the Job record contains the mask for auto-number job id's when using the Job Clone function. In previous releases, it was an all or nothing feature meaning if you made the registry setting ALL jobs must auto-number.</p>
<p>In this release, if the JobSequenceField registry exists AND the job template you are cloning from has a mask in the specified field, the system will continue to auto-number as before. However, if the Job / Job Template DOES NOT have a mask in the specified field, then the user should manually set the Job Id in the Job Clone wizard.</p>
<h3>9.3.2 Import Budget</h3>
<p>In previous releases, if a user attempted to import bad data from a spreadsheet, the system would add blank lines to the Budget tab. &#160;In this version, the system will ask the user to 'Please fix displayed errors and retry the import' and display a text box detailing the errors.</p>
<h3>9.3.3 Job Employee Overrides Tab</h3>
<p><span style="font-weight: bold;">New Field - PyRateAdj:</span><br />
This field enables a Pay Rate Adjustment to be specified by Employee for this Job. &#160;This Adjustment will be added to the Employee's Pay Rate for hours entered for the Labor Rate / Pay Type specified on this tab. This adjustment will also be added to the Job Cost rate for wage-type earnings if the wages are being costed AND the global registry option LaborJobCostRateMethod is set to 7687.</p>
<p>On Hourly Employees (that are not using standard cost), it will Accrue to GL and Job Cost the additional amount if Earnings Id setup this way.</p>
<p>On Hourly Employees that are setup to use standard cost, it will pay the employee the additional amount &amp; accrue it to GL but it will not job cost the additional amount unless a special Standard Cost Earnings Group Id is setup to include the additional amount (and added to the Job's Employee Override tab). &#160;</p>
<p>This additional amount is always ignored on Salary type employees.</p>
<h3><span style="mso-list: l0 level1 lfo1;">9.3.4 &#160;Job Financial Tab</span></h3>
<p style="mso-list: l0 level1 lfo1;"><span style="font-weight: bold;">New Field: CIP Discount Percent</span><br />
This release adds support for Owner Controlled Insurance Program (OCIP) and Contractor Controlled Insurance Program (CCIP) discounted insurance job costing. OCIP/CCIP Job Cost Rate Discounts are implemented by completing this field.&#160;The system will then apply this discount to the non-wage labor (burden) cost portion of labor posted to the Job for Job Cost Codes with the "CIP Discount?" field checked.</p>
<p style="mso-list: l0 level1 lfo1;">NOTE: use of this feature requires that the global registry option LaborJobCostRateMethod is set to New (see Customer Release Note 12.1.2 for details).</p>

<h3>9.10.2 Invoices Tab</h3>
<p style="mso-list: l0 level1 lfo1; font-weight: bold;">New Field: Discount Taken<br />
<span style="font-weight: normal;">This display field is maintained by the system.</span></p>
<h2>9.11 Job Journal</h2>
<p><span style="font-weight: bold;">Changed Field - Total Labor Cost:</span> In previous releases, this running total display field was not promptly updated if the global registry LaborRatesAndAccrualMethod=7687 was enabled. This field is now correctly updated when the Job Cost Code is entered.</p>
<p>The Job Journal's Tab Mismatch logic has been refined to consider all versions (base,-01,-02,etc) when determining if the post to GL will be in balance.</p>
<h3>9.11.1 Accounting Period Validation</h3>
<p>Budget and Budget Change entries no longer require Accounting Period / Date validation. Only 'Actual' type entries require this validation. The Transaction Type CANNOT be changed once data has been entered on any of the child lines.</p>
<p>This release includes validation to ensure that the posting to GLH for each referenced Accounting Period is in balance. If the user attempts to force different accounting periods (with GL enabled) on the Labor or Expenses tab, the message "WARNING: this transaction is out-of-balance and must be corrected before it can be posted" will be displayed. When the user has acknowledged the message, a workspace will be displayed to show the user what is wrong so that the entry can be saved.</p>
<h3>9.11.2 Intercompany Support</h3>
<p>Job Budgets, Job Labor, Job Expense and Projected Cost now have the Security Id set when created in the Inter-Company model.

<h3>10.2.2 <span style="font-weight: bold;">Report Bank Reconciliation (RBNKRECN.RPT)</span></h3>
<p style="font-family: Tahoma; margin-left: 8px;">Revised 2015-08-06 to support edited Bank Deposit Transaction Id's which may now include a tack number.</p>
<h3>10.2.3 &#160;<span style="font-weight: bold;">Crystal Bank Deposit Reports</span></h3>

<h3><span style="font-weight: bold;">10.2.4 &#160;GL Report Row Layout</span></h3>
<p style="margin-left: 8px;">In this release, underlines may also be printed <span style="text-decoration: underline;"><u>below</u></span> totals using the same underline options on the EndTot lines as defined for the BeginTot lines. To do this, enter the character to be used for the underlining (usually "-" or "=") in the - (Underline) field for the EndTot line.</p>
<h3>10.2.5 &#160;GL Income Report</h3>
<p>The release corrects display issue when this report is held open. In previous releases, if the GL Income report was held open after a report was printed, if you attempted to change the GL Reporting Period the RN of the first period run was maintain. &#160;In this release, the GL Reporting Period is properly refreshed.</p>
<h3><span style="font-weight: bold;">10.2.6 Report Journal Listing GL Entries</span></h3>
<p>The report (RGLJRNL.rpt) dated 2016-12-16 fixes a sporadic issue where the report did not match the GL Journal viewer total debits and credits.</p>
<h3><span style="font-weight: bold;">10.2.7 GL Trial Balance Report</span></h3>
<p>This release corrects a sporadic display issue if the GL Entity viewer is open when the report is run.</p>
<h3><span style="font-weight: bold;">10.2.8 Bank Deposit Journal Report:</span></h3>
<p>This new report (BNKDPST.rpt) prints the Journal Entries and associated receipts by the bank GL Account. The Start/End date is based on the Bank Deposit Effective Date.</p>
<h2>10.3 Bank Reconciliation Journal</h2>
<p style="margin-left: 8px;">Edits to the Bank Reconciliation Journal involving blanking the "clear" indicator now reset the Date Reconciled back to "1900-01-01" &#160;for Bank Deposit and Bank Transfer entries. Previously, the Date Reconciled was only cleared on Check tab edits.</p>
<h2>10.4 Bank Deposit Journal</h2>
<p>Validation now ensures that edits to this journal are never allowed in a closed accounting period.&#160;&#160;When an unreconciled Bank Deposit Journal entry is accessed, the user is warned if the Accounting Period is closed, and that Reversing entries will take the Effective Date and Accounting period assigned to the new transactions. When the user changes the Effective Date and Accounting Period and saves the entry, the system writes the reversal AND forwarding transactions to the current period.</p>
<p>The new transaction will be saved with a tack number (01,02, ...) appended to the Bank Deposit Transaction Id.</p>
<h2>10.5 Bank Transfer Journal</h2>
<p>Refined validation checks reconciliation of header and detail GL Account / Entities entries separately. Also prevents changes when the Reconciliation Journal has changed while the Transfer Journal is being edited.</p>
<p>Validation also prevents Bank Transfer Journal entries from being deleted if the Accounting Period is inactive.</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: bold;">New Fields: Parent</span><br />
<span style="font-weight: bold;">Company Id:</span><br />
This field will be completed by the system if Intercompany Security is implemented.</p>

<h2><span style="font-weight: bold;">10.6 Recurring GL Journal</span></h2>
<p style="margin-left: 8px;">The system now validates that each Company referenced is balanced when Intercompany is enabled.</p>
<h3>10.7 GL Reporting Period</h3>
<p><span style="font-weight: bold;">Changed Field: Report Title:</span><br />
In previous releases, the Report Title field was copied when a GL Reporting Period was 'cloned' by editing the GL Reporting Id and tabbing out of the Id field. This resulted in the Report Title being set incorrectly. &#160;In this release, the Report Title is cleared when a GL Reporting Period is cloned: it will be set based on the Fiscal Year and Date when the new record is added.</p>
<h1>11 Assets and Rentals</h1>
<h2>11.1 Reports</h2>
<p>&#160;</p>
<h2>11.2 &#160;Registries</h2>
<p>&#160;</p>
<h2>11.3 Create Rental Billing</h2>
<p>In previous releases, this function skipped all Sites flagged as Inactive, and did not consider the Date Closed (which could be in the future). In this release, this validation is refined so that Site with a future Date Closed will not be skipped when this function is run, even if it is flagged as Inactive.</p>
<h2>11.4 Asset Viewer</h2>
<p style="font-weight: bold;">Changed Fields - Asset User Fields 1-5:<br />
<span style="font-weight: normal;">These fields can be used to set Equipment Fields when creating new equipment via the Create New Equipment button on the Location tab.</span></p>
<p>The following keys can be entered on any of the Asset User fields pass valid Id's to the corresponding Equipment fields.</p>
<p style="margin-left: 48px;">Tech=<span style="font-style: italic;"><i>a valid Technician Id</i></span><br />

Category=<span style="font-style: italic;"><i>a valid Service Category Id</i></span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: bold;">Important Note:</span><br />
Do not include a space between the key and the Id. &#160;For example, to set the Service Category to HVAC:</p>
<p style="margin-left: 48px;">Correct: &#160;Category=HVAC &#160;&#160;&#160;Incorrect: Category = HVAC</p>
<p>Multiple key/id pairs, separated by commas, can be entered on a single Asset User line.</p>
<p style="font-weight: bold; margin-left: 48px;">Tip: Use Custom Fields to Set User Asset Fields</p>
<p style="margin-left: 48px;">The Custom Fields functionality allows the user to select from a list of appropriate key/id combinations.</p>
<h1>12 Payroll</h1>
<h2>12.1. Payroll Registry</h2>
<h3>12.1.1 Auto Sequence Employee Id</h3>
<p>This enhancement provides for the auto-sequencing of Employee Ids. If this option is enabled, the user will not be allowed to specify the Id when creating an Employee. This feature must be discussed with your support representation.</p>
<h3>12.1.2 Registry Entry to Refine Job Cost Calculation</h3>
<p><span style="font-weight: bold;">Id:</span> sys-ffv-global-settings</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: bold;">Setting Key:</span> LaborJobCostRateMethod &#160;<span style="font-weight: bold;">Setting Value:</span> New</p>
<p style="margin-left: 48px;"><span style="font-weight: bold;">NOTE: No Burden From Cost Codes</span><br />
If the above registry is enabled, the system now assumes that the following is also enabled (even if it is not implemented in your database). This ensures that the labor burden is correctly calculated.</p>
<p style="margin-left: 48px;"><span style="font-weight: bold;">Setting Key:</span> <span>DisableCostCodeHourlyBurdenRate &#160;&#160;</span><span style="font-weight: bold;">Setting Value:</span> <span>true</span></p>
<p>The new methodology computes the wages, fringes and j/c-only portions separately then returns sum of the three. This registry is also required if the Pay Rate Adjustments specified on the Job's Employee Overrides tab are to be job costed (for wage type earnings being costed).</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: normal;">The new methodology keeps wage and non-wage hourly-type amounts separately so that percent-type cost lines can be applied to wages only. Note that this registry impacts Job Cost / Job History values, not Payroll. Labor entered in the Work Order, Labor Journal, PR Journal and the Job Journal will use the new methodology enabled via this registry.</span></p>

<p><font style="font-weight: bold;">Registry Id: <span style="font-weight: normal;">sys-401k-</span></font></p>
<h5>Format Designation</h5>
<p style="margin-left: 8px;"><font style="font-weight: bold;">Setting Key:</font> Format <font style="font-weight: bold;">Setting Value:</font> Pinnacle</p>
<p style="margin-left: 8px;">This entry is required.</p>
<h5>Plan Number</h5>
<p style="margin-left: 8px;"><font style="font-weight: bold;">Setting Key:</font> PlanId <font style="font-weight: bold;">Setting Value:</font> <font style="font-style: italic;">plan</font></p>
<p style="margin-left: 8px;">This entry is required. Replace <font style="font-style: italic;">plan</font> with your Pinnacle plan identifier.</p>

<p style="margin-left: 8px;">The filename format is optional, but recommended if you will be running the report for multiple companies (if you are using the branch or security versions of the registry id).</p>
<h5>Loan Repayments</h5>
<p style="margin-left: 8px;"><font style="font-weight: bold;">Setting Key:</font> L01Id <font style="font-weight: bold;">Setting Value:</font> <span style="font-style: italic;"><i>deduction1,deduction2...</i></span></p>
<p style="margin-left: 8px;">These would be entered only if repayments to a 401(k) loan are implemented in your company. <span style="font-style: italic;"><i>deduction1,deduction2...</i></span> would be replaced with the Id (or Id's) of the miscellaneous deductions used to identify loan repayments, separated by commas.</p>
<h3>12.1.6 Registry to Reclassify Burden Cost for Overhead Labor</h3>
<p><span style="font-weight: bold;">Id:</span> sys-ffv-global-settings</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: bold;">Setting Key:</span> ReclassifyBurdenCostForOverheadLabor</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: bold;">Setting Value:</span> true &#160;(default false)</p>
<p>SUMMARY of changes when new registry setting is enabled ...</p>
<p>1. Earnings of type burden (n/a) are included in accruals on overhead jobs.</p>
<p>2. GL Expense for burden (n/a) ALWAYS follows the wages. &#160;This includes overhead AND direct jobs.</p>
<p>Prior to this mod, only Wage-type earnings were included in Labor-to-GL accruals for time charged to overhead jobs. &#160;During the accruals process, the burden expense posts to the same account as the wage expense for any given labor line. &#160;Determination of the wage expense GL Account still follows the standard rules.</p>
<h3>12.1.7 Registry to Match Job Cost / GL Accrual of Labor</h3>
<p>The registry fixes known labor costing issues where the dollars posted to GL Cost-of-Sales and JCH do not match. When enabled, is acts as a comprehensive calculator for Labor Pay Rates, Job Cost Rates and GL Accruals, impacting payroll calculations in the Labor Journal, WO Labor, WO Entry, the Employee Rate Test tab, and Start Compute Payroll.</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: bold;">Id:</span> sys-ffv-global-settings</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: bold;">Setting Key:</span> &#160;LaborRatesAndAccrualMethod &#160;<span style="font-weight: bold;">Setting Value:</span> 7687</p>
<p style="margin-left: 48px;"><span style="font-weight: bold;">IMPORTANT NOTE:</span> We strongly recommend discussing this option with your support rep AND running tests with this registry enabled BEFORE turning it on in your live system. In general, this option should make posting more accurate, but it may be impacted by the customer's specific configuration. The new Select Rate Method to Test field on the Employee Rate Test tab will help with initial testing (Customer Note 12.5.2). In particular, this registry must NOT be used with any customizations that have the Pay Rate field available for input!&#160;</p>

<p>(Note: the Setting Values of TaxTableId or TaxAuthorityId can be used with either of the above setting keys.)</p>
<p>If either or both of these registries are enabled, Compute Payroll checks the User 1 and/or User 2 fields of the Earnings Record to see if there are any Taxable Fringes should NOT be taxed by the listed Tax Authorities or Tax Tables. Note that this ONLY works for Tax Tables specified as 'Always Withhold' on the Employee's taxes tab.</p>
<p style="font-weight: bold;">Earnings Record:</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: bold;">Changed Fields: Earnings User1 - Earnings User2</span><br />
These fields may be used to specify a list of Tax Groups or Tax Authorities for which tax should NOT be assessed if enabled via the above registry setting:</p>
<p style="margin-left: 48px;">If the Earning Record is of Type Fringe, with the Taxable box checked AND &#160;<br />
The FringeTaxExceptionsUser1 or FringeTaxExceptionsUser2 registries are set AND<br />
The Tax Table is specified as 'Always Withhold' on the Employee's taxes tab.</p>
<h3><span style="font-weight: bold;">12.1.10 Custom P</span>R ADP Export</h3>
<p>This new format provides a customized ADP detail record generated by the Report PR Export function. This new processing will be enabled via the following registry options and entries in the Employee User2 field and with consultation with ADP.</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: bold;">Id:</span> sys-pr-export</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: bold;">Setting Key:</span> format &#160;&#160;<span style="font-weight: bold;">Setting Value:</span> ADPKaback</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: bold;">Setting Key</span> TaxFrequencyField &#160;&#160;<span style="font-weight: bold;">Setting Value:</span> emplye_usr2</p>
<p style="margin-left: 48px;"><span style="font-weight: bold;">Note:</span> If the ADPKaback format is specified, the FileId, PathName and CompanyCode keys must also be completed in the registry. The AltEmployeeIDField key is supported. It is optional &#160;and if the key is not present, the emplye_id field is used.</p>
<p style="font-weight: bold;">Employee Record</p>
<p>The Employee User2 field must be set to the appropriate TaxFrequency value. This value will be included in the ADP export detail for the ADPKaback format.</p>
<h3>12.1.11 Custom PR Export Paychex Mod</h3>
<p>The following changes were made to the custom Paychex format PayChexDayNite:</p>
<p style="margin-left: 48px;">Extract the new PayChex Employee # (Employee User1 field) into Employee Id, positions 1-6<br />
Do not extract the SS# into positions 119-128, leave blank</p>
<h3>12.1.12 Registry To Enable Optional Accrual for Bonus Pay</h3>
<p><span style="font-weight: bold;">Id:</span> sys-ffv-global-settings</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: bold;">Setting Key:</span> AccrueBonusPay &#160;&#160;&#160;<span style="font-weight: bold;">Setting Value:</span> true (default false to preserve original behavior)</p>
<p style="margin-left: 48px;"><span style="font-weight: bold;">IMPORTANT:</span> <span>This option may ONLY be enabled if the sys-ffv-global-settings registry option LaborRatesAndAccrualMethod is set to 7687.</span></p>
<p>This setting is only required in version 9.0. Implementing it 'activates' the Payroll Periods User2 field. It answers the question of whether bonus pay should be accrued. &#160;The Payroll Period's User2 field must be set to True to enable this behavior. This registry impacts the Employee viewer; Labor Journal viewer; Payroll Period viewer; Work Order viewer and Compute Payroll.</p>
<h5>Payroll Period</h5>
<p><span style="font-weight: bold;">Changed Field: User2</span><br />
This field is in conjunction with the AccrueBonusPay registry setting in sys-ffv-global-settings. &#160;If this field is set to True AND the registry is set to true, bonus pay entered for this Payroll Period will accrue. If this field is set to False or is blank, bonus pay will NOT accrue regardless of whether or not the AccrueBonusPay setting is enabled.</p>
<p>If your firm accrues bonus pay, It strongly recommended that the Custom Fields functionality be used to change Payroll Period User2 field's label to Accrue Bonus Pay. &#160;Custom Field Values of True and False should be added (these values are NOT case-sensitive).</p>
<p class="Support" style="margin-left: 48px;"><img alt="" src="AccrueBonusPay.bmp" style="border: none;" border="0" /></p>
<h3>12.1.13 Paychex SPI Flex Format</h3>
<p>The Report PR Export function now supports the Paychex SPI Flex Format. The following registry is required to enable this functionality.</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: bold;">Id:</span> sys-pr-export</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: bold;">Setting Key:</span> format <span style="font-weight: bold;">&#160;Setting Value:</span> PaychexSPI</p>
<p>This setting specifies that the Paychex SPI Flex format will be exported. If this setting is enabled, the Paychex format setting should not be enabled!</p>
<p><font style="font-weight: bold;">Setting Key:</font> PathName&#160;<font style="font-weight: bold;">Setting Value:</font> <font style="font-style: italic;">path</font></p>
<p>This setting specifies the complete path of the directory to which SAMPro will export the Paychex file.</p>
<p><font style="font-weight: bold;">Setting Key:</font> ClientNumber <font style="font-weight: bold;">Setting Value:</font> <font style="font-style: italic;">client#</font></p>
<p>This required setting specifies the client number assigned to your firm by Paychex. It will be used to generate part of the filename of the Paychex file.</p>
<h5>12.1.14 Labor Journal Registry to Use Default Service Job in the Equipment record for all but PM WO’s</h5>
<p><font style="font-weight: bold;">Registry Id: <span style="font-weight: normal;">sys-viewer-</span></font>vlbrjrnl</p>
<p><font style="font-weight: bold;">Setting Key:</font> DefaultJobByEquipmentId&#160;<font style="font-weight: bold;">Setting Value:</font> true</p>
<p>Note that this registry is also applied to Labor Journal entries posted from TechAnywhere.</p>
<p>By default, the system uses the Job in the Work Order header as the default job for entering WO-related detail in the Labor Journal. This release supports the above registry setting to alter this behavior. If this registry entry is enabled (and the referenced WO is NOT preventative maintenance), the system will check to see if there is a default service job in the equipment header. If so, the Job, Cost Code and Billing item to the from the Equipment will be defaulted instead of from the WO header. If the job info is blank in the equipment record, the system uses the job info in the work order header.</p>
<p>For Preventive Maintenance Work Orders, Job information defaults from the WO header, regardless of whether or not this registry entry is enabled.</p>
<p>Note: registry options to provide this functionality is also available in the Work Order, AP Journal and Purchase Order registries.</p>

<h3>12.2.4 New Report PR Canadian T4 (Standard) for Standard Printers</h3>
<p><span style="mso-bidi-font-weight: normal;">The new</span> <span style="mso-spacerun: yes;">Report PR Canadian T4s (Standard) and Report PR Canadian T4 Summary (Standard) do not require a</span> <span style="mso-bidi-font-weight: normal;">printer that supports native PCL printing with a PCL 5 or 5c printer driver. These reports may require some changes to your existing registry entries, but are much simpler to run. If you still have the same printer / printer driver that you used for your T4’s last year, you may use the old version of Report PR Canadian T4.</span></p>
<h5><span style="mso-bidi-font-weight: normal;">12.2.4a Setting up and Running the New T4 Reports</span></h5>
<p><span style="font-weight: bold;">Step 1:</span> Once the new version has been installed, run Start Function Update to add the new reports (Report PR Canadian T4s (Standard) and Report PR Canadian T4 Summary (Standard) to the Report menu.</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: bold;">Step 2:</span> Go to the User Group (versions 9.0 and 9.1) or User Groups and Functions (version 8.2) record for the users who will run these reports and give them access to the new reports. <span style="mso-spacerun: yes;">&#160;</span>They must log off and back on to access the reports.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes;">&#160;</span>&#160;Note that if you are running under User Group All you must also log off and on to run the new reports.</p>
<p><b style="mso-bidi-font-weight: normal;">Step 3.</b><span style="mso-spacerun: yes;">&#160;</span>&#160;The new (Report PR Canadian T4s (Standard) and Report PR Canadian T4 Summary (Standard) the same registries as the old T4 reports – review or create the registries listed below as needed.</p>
<p style="mso-bidi-font-weight: normal; margin-left: 48px;"><b>Changes for T4 Printer Registry</b></p>
<p style="margin-left: 48px;">This registry manages the margin adjustments to enable the report to align correctly on the form.</p>
<p style="margin-left: 48px;"><span style="font-weight: bold;">Tip:</span> <span style="mso-spacerun: yes;">&#160;</span>Most printers require negative margin adjustments for the new Report PR Canadian T4s (Standard).<span style="mso-spacerun: yes;">&#160;</span>&#160;We recommend starting with the following settings and adjust as needed following your alignment print:</p>
<p style="margin-left: 48px;"><b style="mso-bidi-font-weight: normal;">Id:</b> sys-printer-t4<br />
<b style="mso-bidi-font-weight: normal;">Setting Key:</b> marginx&#160;&#160;<b style="mso-bidi-font-weight: normal;">Setting Value:</b> -0.63<br />
<b style="mso-bidi-font-weight: normal;">Setting Key:</b> marginy &#160;<b style="mso-bidi-font-weight: normal;">Setting Value:</b> <span style="mso-spacerun: yes;">&#160;</span>-0.85</p>
<p style="margin-left: 48px;"><b style="mso-bidi-font-weight: normal;">Reminder:</b> Negative margin setting values move the report text closer to the upper left-hand corner.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes;">&#160;</span>&#160;Setting values without the negative sign move the report text to the right (marginx) and down (marginy).</p>
<p style="margin-left: 48px;">It is not necessary to specify a default printer in this registry if you are using the new Report PR Canadian T4s (Standard) report.</p>
<p style="mso-bidi-font-weight: normal; margin-left: 48px;"><b>New Registry for T4 Summary</b></p>
<p style="margin-left: 48px;">The following registry may be used to specify margin adjustments on the T4 Summary (Standard) if they are different from the T4 (Standard). Most printers require negative margin adjustments for the new Report PR Canadian T4 Summary (Standard).<span style="mso-spacerun: yes;">&#160;</span>&#160;We recommend starting with the following settings and adjusting as needed following your alignment print:</p>
<p style="margin-left: 48px;"><b style="mso-bidi-font-weight: normal;">Id:</b> sys-printer-t4summary<br />
<b style="mso-bidi-font-weight: normal;">Setting Key:</b> marginx &#160;<b style="mso-bidi-font-weight: normal;">Setting Value:</b> -0.55<br />
<b style="mso-bidi-font-weight: normal;">Setting Key:</b> marginy &#160;<b style="mso-bidi-font-weight: normal;">Setting Value:</b> -0.95</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: bold;">Step 4</span>. <b style="mso-bidi-font-weight: normal;">Unless your support representative updated your Folders view or made the appropriate Function Substitution, you will need to run the new reports from the Report Menu.</b><span style="mso-spacerun: yes;">&#160;</span>Run Report PR Canadian T4 (Standard) and print a test alignment of your tax forms for one or two employees before running all copies. You will be prompted to run the T4 Summary (although Report PR Canadian T4 Summary (Standard) may be also be run stand-alone).</p>
<p>Make any adjustments needed to the horizontal or vertical positions via the sys-printer-t4 and/or sys-printer-t4summary registries and recheck for alignment as needed.</p>
<p><b style="mso-bidi-font-weight: normal;">Step 5.</b> Once you are happy with your alignment, run the necessary copies of your T4 forms. A message will be displayed while the forms are still printing:</p>
<p>Print T4 Summary Form? Insert Form Now.</p>
<p>If you want to print the T4 Summary, DO NOT RESPOND TO THIS MESSAGE IMMEDIATELY. The user should verify that all T4's have been printed, and then load the T4 Summary form in the printer.</p>
<p>After the T4 Summary form has been loaded, the user should then click Yes in the message box.</p>

<h3>12.2.5 Report Payroll GL Accounts</h3>
<p>The revised Report Payroll GL Accounts (RPRGLAC.rpt) dated 2016-06-10 includes a new GL Account range.</p>
<h3><span style="font-weight: bold;">12.2.5 Report PR Checks</span></h3>
<p>Previously, the Document Description for saved PR Checks included the GL Account, Entity and Check #. The Document Description now includes the PR Period Id, Check Date &amp; Check #.</p>
<p>The system now prevents the user from running the check report if the Checklist screen is open but the Check Report screen has been closed. &#160;</p>
<p style="margin-left: 8px;">When Intercompany is enabled, the Security Id is now set in the Check record when Checks are posted or voided.</p>
<h3>12.2.5a Bonus Payroll Checks - Preferred Method for Version 9.0 and Up</h3>
<p style="margin-left: 8px;">The new Federal Tax Rate and State Tax Rate overrides on the Labor Journal Hours Tab Detail allow large Bonus Checks to be generated without the need change the Employee Record's Taxes tab. See Customer Note 12.17.4 for additional information on using the new fields.</p>
<p>1. Establish a new PAYROLL PERIOD for bonus checks. Example: 2017-Sept-B.</p>
<p style=" margin-left:36.00pt; border-top:0.50pt solid #000000; border-bottom:0.50pt solid #000000; border-left:0.50pt solid #000000; border-right:0.50pt solid #000000; border-width:4px;"><font style="font-weight: bold;">Note:&#160;&#160;</font><span>Unless overridden via registry,</span> <font style="font-weight: bold;">BONUS</font> amounts (entered on the Labor Journal) will <font style="font-weight: bold;">NOT</font> Accrue/post to the GL, regardless of how the Accrue to GL field is checked in the Payroll Period.</p>
<p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">&#160;</p>
<p style=" margin-left:36.00pt; border-top:0.50pt solid #000000; border-bottom:0.50pt solid #000000; border-left:0.50pt solid #000000; border-right:0.50pt solid #000000; border-width:4px;"><font style="font-weight: bold;">Note: PTO Accrual and Bonus Pay Periods<br /></font>Typically, PTO Hours would not be accrued on bonus payroll periods. Do NOT check the Accrue PTO or the Remote Technician Applet boxes on you Bonus Payroll Period.</p>
<p>2. Establish a new PAY TYPE if one doesn't already exist.</p>
<p style="margin-left: 48px;"><span style="font-weight: bold;">Pay Type Id:</span>&#160;&#160;Bonus&#160;&#160;<span style="font-weight: bold;">Description:</span>&#160;&#160;Bonus &#160;&#160;&#160;<span style="font-weight: bold;">Check Label:</span>&#160;&#160;Bonus&#160;</p>
<p style="margin-left: 48px;"><span style="font-weight: bold;">Rate Factor:</span>&#160;&#160;1.000 &#160;&#160;&#160;<span style="font-weight: bold;">Show Rate on CK:</span>&#160;optional</p>
<p style="margin-left: 48px;"><span style="font-weight: bold;">Hours Type:</span>&#160;&#160;Other &#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;<span style="font-weight: bold;">GL Acct Id:</span>&#160;&#160;GL for Wages or Bonus Wages</p>
<p style="margin-left: 48px;"><span style="font-weight: bold;">Earnings Grp Id:</span>&#160;&#160;n/a</p>
<p>3. In the LABOR JOURNAL, enter all bonus amounts using the new bonus Pay Period Id setup in step 1 above (example: 2017-Sept-B).</p>
<p>After inputting zero hours to an overhead Job and your Bonus Pay Type, double click on the MAGNIFY GLASS of the line. Confirm and edit as follows:</p>
<p style="margin-left: 48px;"><span style="font-weight: bold;">Hours:</span>&#160;&#160;&#160;000.00</p>
<p style="margin-left: 48px;"><span style="font-weight: bold;">Salary?</span>&#160;&#160;(not checked)</p>
<p style="margin-left: 48px;"><span style="font-weight: bold;">Extra?</span>&#160;&#160;&#160;(not checked)</p>
<p style="margin-left: 48px;"><span style="font-weight: bold;">Pay Type Id:</span>&#160;&#160;Bonus</p>
<p style="margin-left: 48px;"><span style="font-weight: bold;">Bonus Amount:</span>&#160;&#160;Enter Bonus Dollars to Pay this Employee</p>
<p style="font-weight: bold; margin-left: 48px;">Federal Tax Rate:<br />
State Tax Rate:<br />
<span style="font-weight: normal;">These fields provide a flat rate override to the Federal / State Income Tax rate brackets in the Employee's Federal (FED-M or FED-S) and State Tax Tables. These fields are intended to be used for Bonus pay only. If these field are blank, the Federal / State Tax Table will be used as before.</span> <span style="font-weight: normal;">Enter the appropriate rate for bonuses prescribed by the tax authority.</span></p>
<p style="font-weight: bold; margin-left: 88px;">Important Notes On Usage:</p>
<p style="margin-left: 88px;">1. The overriding federal and/or state tax rates are applied directly to the Bonus Amount with which they are associated. &#160;Taxable wage reductions (125, 401k, etc) are NOT applied to the Bonus Amount before computing FIT/SIT using the special tax rates. Tax is on Total Earnings when using this option. If this is not desired, the old methodology of changing the Employee record's Tax tab to specify a flat tax FED-bonus entry may be used instead.</p>
<p style="margin-left: 88px;">2. Taxable wage reductions will eventually reduce the Taxable Wages so payroll reports, including W2s, will have the correct info.</p>
<p style="margin-left: 88px;">Consider the example where an employee received a $10,000 bonus with 20% special FIT tax rate, 10% special SIT tax rate and 5% 401k deduction. &#160;In the event special tax rates have been specified, the following is the order in which the calculations occur:</p>
<p style="margin-left: 128px;">Gross Wages = $10,000</p>
<p style="margin-left: 128px;">FIT = $2,000 (10,000 x .2)</p>
<p style="margin-left: 128px;">SIT = $1,000 (10,000 x .1)</p>
<p style="margin-left: 128px;">401k = $500 (10,000 x .05)</p>
<p style="margin-left: 128px;">Taxable Wage = $9,500 (10,000 - 500)</p>
<p>4. Run the COMPUTE PAYROLL function for the new bonus Pay Period Id and the print the PAYROLL WORKSHEET before printing your checks to confirm your bonus checks are correct for the new bonus Pay Period Id.</p>
<p style="margin-left: 48px;"><span style="font-weight: bold;">Tip:</span> Use Pay/Deduct Cycle Code XXXX to skip all deductions!</p>
<h3><span style="font-weight: bold;">12.2.6 Report PR Misc Deductions Checks</span></h3>
<p style="margin-left: 8px;">This release corrects a problem where the Vendor was not always correctly written to the Check record when multiple Vendors were included in the Check run (note that the Vendor was correctly listed on the printed check).</p>
<p style="margin-left: 8px;">When Intercompany is enabled, validation ensures that a Company is selected and the GL Entity completed when the report is run. The GL Entity now writes to the Check record when the checks are posted.</p>
<p style="margin-left: 8px;">When Intercompany is enabled, the Security Id is now set in the Check record when Checks are posted or voided.</p>
<p style="margin-left: 8px;">These checks now print correctly when the 20 reference limit on the stub is exceeded. &#160;</p>
<h3><span style="font-weight: bold;">12.2.7 Report PR Check Detail (RPRCHCKDTL)</span></h3>
<p>The revised report RPRCHCKDTL.rpt dated 2016-02-17 supports GL Account / GL Entities in processing the report so that the appropriate registries (for bitmaps, etc.) will be referenced. &#160;This report also includes formatting enhancements and allows for the printing of the report description on the report.</p>
<p style="margin-left: 8px;">Employer-based taxes are no longer included (as of 2015-06-23) since this report is used as a ‘check stub’ for companies not printing actual checks when doing Direct Deposit.</p>
<h3>12.2.8 &#160;Executive PR Processing - Revised Reports to Install</h3>
<p style="margin-left: 8px;">Executive PR processing has been added to the following reports via the following filter:</p>
<p style="margin-left: 8px;"><span style="font-weight: bold;">New Filter - Executive PR:</span><br />
If you are an Executive Payroll user, this field will default to Y; to run this function for all employees (Executive or not) clear this range. If your User record is not flagged as Executive Payroll, you will only be able to run this function for other non-Executive users even if you clear the filter.</p>

<p style="margin-left: 8px;">This new report, dated 2015-08-19, excludes AP and PRMD checks. Only PR checks (both Executive and non-Executive PR) will be listed.</p>
<h3>12.2.10 Report PR Export for ADP</h3>
<p>The following entries are required for ADP Exports implemented with Report PR Export) rather than the earlier ADP Export functionality.</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: bold;">Registry Id:</span> sys-pr-export</p>
<p><font style="font-weight: bold;">Setting Key:</font> Format&#160;<font style="font-weight: bold;">Setting Value:</font> ADP</p>
<p>This registry option specifies that the ADP formatting will be used in the Report Payroll Export function.</p>
<p><font style="font-weight: bold;">Setting Key:</font> PathName&#160;<font style="font-weight: bold;">Setting Value:</font> <font style="font-style: italic;">path</font></p>
<p>This registry option specifies the complete path of the directory to which SAMPro will export the ADP file.</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: bold;"><font style="font-weight: bold;">S</font>etting Key:</span> FileId &#160;&#160;<span style="font-weight: bold;">Setting Value:</span> <font style="font-style: italic;">YY</font></p>
<p><font style="font-style: italic;">YY</font> should be replaced by a 1-2 character code used to generate the filename. This is also a field on the input screen. If the FileId is set in the Registry, it will automatically default into the report range screen.</p>
<p><font style="font-weight: bold;">Setting Key:</font> CompanyCode <font style="font-weight: bold;">Setting Value:</font> 2-3 character code</p>
<p style="font-weight: normal;">This is also a field on the input screen.&#160;&#160;If the CompanyCode is set in the Registry, it will automatically default into report range screen.</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: bold;">Setting Key:</span> AltEmployeeIDField &#160;&#160;<span style="font-weight: bold;">Setting Value:</span> <span style="font-style: italic;"><i>database field with alternate id</i></span></p>
<p>The Setting Value of this option should specify the database field name (i.e emplye_usr1) which contains the alternate employee id.</p>
<h3>12.2.10a Reclassification of ADP Labor via PRS Codes for Report PR Export</h3>
<p>This release now supports the reclassification of regular and overtime hours via the presence of a PRS code in the Pay Type's PRS Pay Code field for the ADP format only. Currently anything outside of Regular or Overtime requires a PRS code; the code and hours goes into column 3 of the export. In this release, the code is flexible so that if a Pay Type that is for regular hours, but should be re-classified on the ADP pay stub (i.e. Prevailing Wage hours and rate), the PRS code should be entered in the Pay Type.&#160;&#160;The presence of the PRS code causes the export to put the code and hours in column 3 (hours 3).</p>
<h3><span style="font-weight: bold;">12.2.11 W2 Forms (Plain Paper Copy)</span></h3>
<p>The W2 Year is now printed below the Copy label on the Plain Paper Copy version of the report.</p>
<h3>12.2.11a &#160;New Report PR W-2s (Standard) and Report PR W-3s (Standard)</h3>
<p style="font-weight: normal; mso-spacerun: yes;"><span style="mso-bidi-font-weight: normal;">The new</span> Report PR W-2s (Standard) and Report PR W-3s (Standard) do not require a <span style="mso-bidi-font-weight: normal;">printer that supports native PCL printing with a PCL 5 or 5c printer driver. These report may required some changes to your existing registry entries, but are much simpler to run. If you still have the same printer / printer driver that you used for your W2’s last year, you may use the old version of Report PR W-2.</span></p>
<p class="MsoNormal"><b style="mso-bidi-font-weight: normal;"><span style="mso-bidi-font-weight: normal;">S</span>tep 1.</b> Once the new version has been installed, run Start Function List Update to add the new reports (Report PR W-2s (Standard) and Report PR W-3s (Standard) to the Report menu.</p>
<p class="MsoNormal"><b style="mso-bidi-font-weight: normal;">Step 2.</b> Go to the User Group (versions 9.0 and 9.1) or User Groups and Functions (version 8.2) record for the users who will run these reports and give them access to the new reports. <span style="mso-spacerun: yes;">&#160;</span>They must log off and back on to access the reports.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes;">&#160;</span>&#160;Note that if you are running under User Group All you must also log off and on to run the new reports.</p>
<p class="MsoNormal"><b style="mso-bidi-font-weight: normal;">Step 3.</b><span style="mso-spacerun: yes;">&#160;</span>&#160;The new Report PR W-2s (Standard) and Report PR W-3 (Standard) use the same registries as the old reports – review or create these registries as needed:</p>
<p class="MsoNormal" style="margin-left: .5in;"><b style="mso-bidi-font-weight: normal;">companyEINfederal (see Help for details)</b></p>
<p class="MsoNormal" style="margin-left: .5in;"><b style="mso-bidi-font-weight: normal;">sys-report-rW2 (also sets contact info for the W-3 – see Help for details)</b></p>
<p class="MsoNormal" style="margin-left: .5in;"><b style="mso-bidi-font-weight: normal;">Changes for W2 Printer Registry</b></p>
<p class="MsoNormal" style="margin-left: .5in;"><b style="mso-bidi-font-weight: normal;">sys-printer-w2</b> (sets margin adjustments)</p>
<p class="MsoNormal" style="margin-left: 1.0in;">Tip: <span style="mso-spacerun: yes;">&#160;</span>Most printers require negative margin adjustments for the new Report PR W-2s (Standard).<span style="mso-spacerun: yes;">&#160;</span>&#160;We recommend starting with the following settings and adjust as needed following your alignment print:</p>
<p class="MsoNormal" style="margin-left: 1.0in;"><b style="mso-bidi-font-weight: normal;">Id:</b> sys-printer-w2<br />
<b style="mso-bidi-font-weight: normal;">Setting Key:</b> marginx&#160;&#160;<b style="mso-bidi-font-weight: normal;">Setting Value:</b> -0.05<br />

<p class="MsoNormal" style="margin-left: 1.5in;"><b style="mso-bidi-font-weight: normal;">Reminder:</b> Negative margin setting values move the report text closer to the upper left-hand corner.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes;">&#160;</span>&#160;Setting values without the negative sign move the report text to the right (marginx) and down (marginy).</p>
<p class="MsoNormal" style="margin-left: 1.0in;">Note: it is not necessary to specify a default printer in this registry if you are using the new Report PR W-2s (Standard) report.</p>
<p class="MsoNormal" style="margin-left: .5in;"><b style="mso-bidi-font-weight: normal;">New Registry for W3 Printer</b></p>
<p class="MsoNormal" style="margin-left: .5in;">The following registry may be used to specify margin adjustments on the W-3 if they are different from the W-2. Most printers require negative margin adjustments for the new Report PR W-3s (Standard).<span style="mso-spacerun: yes;">&#160;</span>&#160;We recommend starting with the following settings and adjusting as needed following your alignment print:</p>
<p class="MsoNormal" style="margin-left: 1.0in;"><b style="mso-bidi-font-weight: normal;">Id:</b> sys-printer-w3<br />
<b style="mso-bidi-font-weight: normal;">Setting Key:</b> marginx &#160;<b style="mso-bidi-font-weight: normal;">Setting Value:</b> -0.05<br />
<b style="mso-bidi-font-weight: normal;">Setting Key:</b> marginy &#160;<b style="mso-bidi-font-weight: normal;">Setting Value:</b> -0.72</p>
<p class="MsoNormal"><b style="mso-bidi-font-weight: normal;">Step 4.</b> <span style="mso-spacerun: yes;">&#160;</span><b style="mso-bidi-font-weight: normal;">Unless your support representative updated your Folders view or made the appropriate Function Substitution, you will need to run the new reports from the Report Menu.</b><span style="mso-spacerun: yes;">&#160;</span>&#160;Run Report W-2 (Standard) and print a test alignment of your tax forms for one or two employees before running all copies. You will be prompted to run the W-3 (see the W3 Printing Tip below), although Report PR W-3s (Standard) may be also be run stand-alone.</p>
<p class="MsoNormal">Make any adjustments needed to the horizontal or vertical positions via the sys-printer-W2 and/or sys-printer-W3 registries and recheck for alignment as needed.</p>
<p class="MsoNormal"><b style="mso-bidi-font-weight: normal;">Step 5.</b> Once you are happy with your alignment, run the necessary copies of your W-2 and W-3 forms (see Help for details).</p>
<p class="MsoNormal" style="margin-left: .5in;"><b style="mso-bidi-font-weight: normal;">W3 Printing Tips:<br /></b>The Copy A option of Report PR W-2s (Standard) allows the printing of a W3 form at the end of the report. The system will print the Copy A’s and summary page as usual, and then pause. The following message box will appear:</p>
<p class="MsoNormal" style="margin-left: 1.0in;">&#160;Print W3 Form? Insert W3 Form Now.</p>
<p class="MsoNormal" style="margin-left: .5in;">If you want to print the W3, DO NOT RESPOND TO THIS MESSAGE IMMEDIATELY. To print the W3 form, the user should verify that all Copy A’s plus the summary page have been printed, and then load the W3 form in the printer.</p>
<p class="MsoNormal" style="margin-left: .5in;">After the W3 form has been loaded, the user should then click Yes in the message box to display and then print the W3 form. Note that if taxes for more than one state have been assessed, an X will be printed in the State portion of Box 15, and the Employer’s state ID number will be blank.</p>
<h3>12.2.11b - Report PR W2's / Report PR W2's (Standard) Copy 2 Residual Tax</h3>
<p style="margin-left: 8px;">If Residual Tax Withholding is used, Local tax may be overstated on Line 2 of the&#160;W2's. The following new registry entry will omit the print of Local Line 2 on the&#160;W2's.</p>
<p style="margin-left: 8px;"><span style="font-weight: bold;">Id:</span> sys-report-rw2</p>
<p style="margin-left: 8px;"><span style="font-weight: bold;">Setting Key:</span> OmitLocalLine2 &#160;<span style="font-weight: bold;">Setting Value:</span> true (default is false)</p>
<p>To omit Local tax only on Copy 2, the following registry may be used instead.</p>
<p style="margin-left: 8px;"><span style="font-weight: bold;">Setting Key:</span> OmitCopy2LocalLine <span style="font-weight: bold;">Setting Value:</span> true &#160;&#160;(default is false)</p>
<h3>12.2.11c Alternate W2 12:DD (HSA Employer Costs) Processing</h3>
<p style="margin-left: 8px;">Some users wish to set up an Earnings Id to process&#160;W2&#160;12:DD (HSA Employer Costs) and include this Earnings Id in regular PR processing. This procedure populated both prhstryernngs_amnt_ernngs &amp; prhstryernngs_amnt_fringe fields. The&#160;W2&#160;report sums (prhstryernngs_amnt_ernngs + prhstryernngs_amnt_fringe) which is cause the amount in box 12:DD to be overstated.&#160;</p>
<p style="margin-left: 40px;">NOTE: This processing does not follow the instructions in the Data-Basics EOY document.</p>
<p style="margin-left: 8px;">In this release, setting the Earning record's User2 field to a value of FringeOnlyW2 changes the default behavior to only include prhstryernngs_amnt_frnge in the calculation for specific earnings on&#160;W2's which corrects the overstatement.</p>
<h3>12.2.12 Report EFT Payroll</h3>
<p style="font-weight: normal;">This release corrects the landscape formatting of the printed Electronic Payment Register report generated when Report EFT Payroll is run to produce the electronic file for direct deposit.</p>
<h3>12.2.13 Report AFT Payroll</h3>
<p style="font-weight: normal;">This release corrects the landscape formatting of the printed Electronic Payment Register report generated when Report AFT Payroll is run to produce the electronic file for direct deposit.</p>
<h3><span style="font-weight: bold;">12.2.14 Report PR Deductions Detail</span></h3>
<p style="font-weight: normal;">The revised report&#160;(RPRDEDDTL.rpt) dated 2017-08-30 includes a new filter range for the GL Entity ID which relates to the GL entity assigned to the employee records.</p>
<h3><span style="font-weight: bold;">12.2.15 Report PR Miscellaneous Deduction Check Detail</span></h3>
<p>This release corrects a problem which resulted in duplicate lines appearing on the report if the Employee Deductions Tab included multiple lines with the same Deduction Id for different date ranges. This is a system report and does not need to be imported into your database.</p>
<h3><span style="font-weight: bold;">12.2.16 Report W2 Electronic File</span></h3>
<p>The Electronic W2 Report (RW2EFv72b105.rpt dated 2018-01-17) has been revised to allow successful submission with the "Permitted Benefits Under a Qualified Small Employer Health Reimbursement Arrangement" change made this year.

<h2>12.3 &#160;Pay Type Viewer</h2>
<p><span style="font-weight: bold;">New Fields: Pay Type User 3-5</span><br />
These new fields were added to support TechAnywhere and other user-specific requirements.</p>
<h2>12.4 Union Viewer</h2>
<p>The following phone extension field has been expanded to 7 digits in this release:</p>
<p style="margin-left: 48px; font-weight: bold;">Union Extension</p>
<h2>12.5 Payroll Period</h2>
<p><span style="font-weight: bold;">Changed Field: Default?</span><br />
When a Payroll Period record is saved, the user is now warned if there is no Payroll Period flagged as Default. &#160;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: bold;">Changed Field: User2</span><br />
This field is in conjunction with the AccrueBonusPay registry setting in sys-ffv-global-settings. &#160;If this field is set to True AND the registry is set to true, bonus pay entered for this Payroll Period will accrue. If this field is set to False or is blank, bonus pay will NOT accrue regardless of whether or not the AccrueBonusPay setting is enabled. See Customer Note 12.1.12 for details.</p>
<h3>12.5.1 Payroll Period List</h3>
<p>A new sort order, PayrollPeriodByYear has been added to allow Payroll Periods to be sorted by the Payroll Year field. The following field are displayed:</p>
<p>Year - Quarter - Month - Start Date - End Day - Payroll Period Id - Description - Accounting Period Id</p>
<p style="margin-left: 48px;"><span style="font-weight: bold;">Tip:</span><br />
To sort periods with the most recent fiscal year first, click the Year column header.</p>
<h3>12.5.2 Payroll Period Range Filter</h3>
<p>The following ranges have been added to assist in filtering:</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: bold;">Year<br />
Quarter<br />
Month</span><br />
<span style="font-weight: bold;">Accrue to GL?</span> (enter Y for records with this field checked, N for records with this field blank)<br />
<span style="font-weight: bold;">Accrue to PTO?</span> (enter Y for records with this field checked, N for records with this field blank)<br />
<span style="font-weight: bold;">Pay with EFT?</span> (enter Y for records with this field checked, N for records with this field blank)</p>
<h3>12.5.3 Payroll Period Hours Tab</h3>
<p>The Hours Tab is now filtered based on the User's Executive PR and Branch Filter fields. Data for Executive Payroll Employees (Executive P/R flagged in the Employee record) will only be displayed if the Executive PR? box is checked in their User record.</p>
<p>Filtering based on the User's Branch Filter only comes into play when the hard-block filtering option is turned on via the following registry setting:</p>
<p style="margin-left: 48px;">Id: sys-ffv-global-settings<br />
Setting Key: BranchFilterWithHardBlock &#160;&#160;&#160;Setting Value:true</p>
<h2>12.8 Compute Overtime</h2>
<p>See Customer Note 12.18 for an enhancement which support Overtime processing when checks are not printed or posted.</p>
<h3>12.8.1 Compute PR - OT Processing</h3>
<p>GL transaction activity (generated by Compute Payroll) which is related to the Compute Overtime function has been refined so that transaction effective dates match work dates. This solves timing issues that exist when a Pay Period straddles multiple Accounting Periods.</p>
<p>This release eliminates the requirement that employees belong to branches.</p>
<p>This release matches up the Accounting Period and Effective Date when posting Allocated OT Premium.</p>
<h2>12.9 Compute Payroll</h2>
<p>This release corrects the setting of the Earnings Id where a 'fixed' earning amount type is specified (such as a Bonus amounts entered on the Employee Recurring Wages tab). &#160;</p>
<p>Taxes for Tax Authorities not marked 'Always Withhold' on the Employee Tax tab are only assessed for labor for a Job referencing that Tax Authority. This corrects a problem in recent releases.</p>
<p>The pay method is forced to 'flat' when hours = 0 and pay amount &lt;&gt; 0 to overcome a sporadic Labor Journal issue.&#160;</p>
<p>This release corrects a sporadic virtual stack overflow error when OT Premiums are allocated.</p>
<p>This release implements Intercompany processing for employer taxes (etc.) allocated during the compute to ensure that all companies are in balance after processing payroll.</p>
<p>This release refines the rounding of payroll taxes.</p>
<p>A new column, prhstryjc.prhstryjc_frnge_rte has been added to assist in the correct computation of PR Fringes Allocated to JCH.&#160;&#160;The system now uses the new fringe rate field when available.</p>
<p style="font-weight: bold;"><span style="font-weight: normal;">If the new GL Expense Account is completed in the Employee's Tax Tab, Compute PR will use it to post to GL History instead of using the GL Expense account in the associated Tax Authority.&#160;&#160;If this field is blank, the system will continue to use the GL Expense Account in the Tax Authority.</span>&#160;&#160;</p>
<p style="margin-left: 48px;"><span style="font-weight: bold;">Note:</span> the sys-compute-payroll registry PRExpenseAccount&#160;option trumps the GL Expense Accounts on the Tax Authority and Employee Taxes tab.</p>
<h3>12.9.1 &#160;Payroll Fringe Accruals</h3>
<p>In previous releases, you could not accrue an Earnings ID marked Fringe because it would be double-costed when Print/Post Payroll Checks was run. This made it necessary to set up 2 Earnings Id's to book estimated fringes, and then to make an adjustment at month or quarter end to 'adjust' the cost estimates to match the actual.</p>
<p>In this version, Compute Payroll no longer generates Fringe Expense and Liability GL activity for fringes that have been accrued so that Fringe-type Earnings may be marked as Accrue. Note that users who did not print/post Payroll checks were always allowed to accrue the Fringes.</p>
<p style="margin-left: 48px;"><span style="font-weight: bold;">Note:</span> Consult your Data-Basics Support Rep before changing any existing Fringe Earnings to the new methodology. &#160;The previous setup will continue to work.</p>
<h3>12.9.2 Refinements to Extra Withholding</h3>
<p>In previous releases, if annualized Gross Pay was not high enough to qualify for a taxable rate line on an applicable Tax Table, extra withholding would not be applied. This release corrects this issue and allows the specified extra withholding to be applied. Note that if the extra withholding would result in negative net pay, the compute will return an error. This must be corrected (e.g., by temporarily reducing the extra withholding) before a check can be produced.</p>
<h3>12.9.3 GL Entity Debit</h3>
<p style="margin-left: 8px;">Compute Payroll now supports the setting of the GL Entity Debit from the Job if the Earnings Id's Entity is blank. The GL Entity Credit continues to work as before.</p>
<h3><span style="font-weight: bold;">12.9.4 Registry to Set Debit Account for Fringe Expenses Accrued on Direct Jobs</span></h3>
<p>This new registry option supplements the GL Account settings currently found in the Earnings record. &#160;This registry setting is used during Labor entry. &#160;It specifies the Debit account for Fringe Expenses accrued against direct (non-overhead) jobs.</p>
<p>Registry Id: sys-ffv-global-settings</p>
<p>Setting Key: COSFringeGLAccountId &#160;Setting Value: GL Account Id</p>
<h2>12.10 Employee Record</h2>
<h3>12.10.1 Recurring Wages Tab</h3>
<p><span style="font-weight: bold;">New Field: Bonus Amount</span><br />
This new field may be used to pay flat per-period amounts such as Car Allowances. It will be written to the corresponding Bonus field in the Labor Journal. &#160;If this field is completed, the Hours field should be blank, and an appropriate Pay Type must be selected (Hours Type and Category should both be set to Other).</p>
<h3>12.10.2 &#160;Taxes Tab</h3>
<p style="font-weight: bold;">Detail View<br />
New Field: GL Expense Account</p>
<p>This field enables the use of multiple GL Accounts for employer based taxes.&#160;This field can only be set if the selected Tax Table has the Tax Employer? box checked. If this field is completed, the Compute PR function will use it to post to GL History instead of using the GL Expense account in the associated Tax Authority.&#160;&#160;If this field is blank, the system will continue to use the GL Expense Account in the Tax Authority.&#160;&#160;</p>
<p style="margin-left: 48px;"><span style="font-weight: bold;">Note:</span> the sys-compute-payroll registry PRExpenseAccount&#160;&#160;option trumps the GL Expense Accounts on the Tax Authority and Employee Taxes tab.</p>
<h3>12.10.3 New Tab: Rate Test</h3>
<p>This tab enables the user to see what the Employee's Pay and Job Cost rates are under a variety of scenarios (e.g., specific dates, jobs, etc.).</p>
<p style="font-weight: bold;">Data Entry Fields:</p>

<h3><span style="mso-list: l0 level1 lfo1;">12.10.4 &#160;Employee</span> Earnings Tab</h3>
<p><span style="font-weight: bold;">Changed Field - Amount Type:</span><br />
A new Amount Type, Fixed (per Payroll Period), is available for Fringes. This could be used to record taxable, company-owned vehicle usage. Validation ensures that the Amount Type of Fixed may only be selected if all of the following are true:</p>
<p style="margin-left: 48px;">The Earnings Type is set to Fringe<br />
The Fringe is not Accrued<br />
The Fringe is not Job Costed</p>
<h3>12.10.5 New Tab: Job Overrides</h3>
<p>This tab lists any Jobs referencing the selected Employee on the Job Employee Overrides tab. The following fields from the Job's Employee Overrides Tab are displayed:</p>
<p style="font-weight: bold;">Job Id - Earning Group - Deduction Group - Labor Rate - Pay Type - Pay Adjustment</p>
<h3>12.10.6 Main Tab</h3>
<p style="font-weight: bold;"><span style="font-weight: normal;">When a user 'clones' an employee record by changing the Employee Id and tabbing out of the field, the US SocSecNo: or Canadian SIN: will be cleared.</span></p>
<h2>12.11 Start Generate Recurring Labor</h2>
<p>This function correctly identifies all eligible Recurring Labor and Other entries. &#160;Previously, entries were skipped if the Employee Start/End Date fell entirely within the Payroll Period's Effective Dates. If the Start/End Dates of the Recurring lines on the Employee record intersect at ANY point within the Period Start/End (work) dates, the line now qualifies as "eligible".</p>
<p>If a warning (e.g., employee terminated) is encountered, all valid entries will be created; a list of the entries which were and were not created will be displayed. Previously, no entries were created.</p>
<p>This release corrects Cost Category defaulting so that the value from the Employee Recurring Wage Tab always takes precedent.</p>
<p>The new Bonus Amount field on the Employee's Recurring Wages tab may be used to pay flat per-period amounts such as Car Allowances. It will be written to the corresponding Bonus field in the Labor Journal when this function is run. &#160;If the Bonus Amount field is completed, the Hours field should be blank, and an appropriate Pay Type must be selected (Hours Type and Category should both be set to Other).</p>
<h2>12.12 Deduction Group</h2>
<h3>12.12.1 Deduction Group Deductions Tab</h3>
<p style="font-weight: bold;">Changed Field - Amount:</p>
<p style="font-weight: bold;"><b style="mso-bidi-font-weight: normal;"><span style="font-weight: bold;">The restriction that this field may not be zero has been removed.</span><span style="mso-spacerun: yes; font-weight: bold;">&#160;</span></b></p>
<p>Note that Compute PR skips Deduction Group lines when the Amount is zero. However, the Deduction line may still be used for certain types of special union reporting.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes;">&#160;</span>&#160;When the union has an elective deduction (e.g. 401K union) or employee elects to take an additional amount (e.g. increase VacFund amount by .25).<span style="mso-spacerun: yes;">&#160;</span>&#160;Instead of having to create a separate Deductions Group for each Union &amp; Employee or separate Union Deduction Groups w/various percentages/fixed amounts, the setup would include a Deduction record (e.g, 401K Union# or VacFund-Union#) with the UNION ID in the User1 field.</p>
<p style="margin-left: 48px;">This Deduction would be added to the Employee Deductions Tab for those employees taking the deduction, with the appropriate Amount completed.</p>
<p style="margin-left: 48px;">The Deduction (with the UNION ID in the User1 field) would also be added to the Deduction Group(s) for the Union with the Amount set to zero or a base amount.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes;">&#160;</span>&#160;This line is required for reporting purposes so that so that these additional dollars are also picked up on the union report.</p>
<h2>12.13 Canadian Payroll</h2>
<h3>12.13.1 Report PR Canadian Electronic T4s</h3>
<p style="margin-left: 8px;">Corrects a problem reporting Employment Insurance Earnings &amp; Canada Pension Plan and Quebec Pension Plan by forcing a print of 0.00 for EI &amp; CPP-QPP earnings for exempt employees.</p>
<p style="margin-left: 8px;">Multiple provinces will be combined in one file if the Province is blank on the input screen. The province is determined from the Employee record.</p>
<p style="margin-left: 8px;">Pension Adjustments may be entered using Earning Id's with the W2 Category set to 52. These Pension Adjustment amounts will be printed in Box 52.</p>
<p style="margin-left: 8px;">RPP Contribution amounts should be entered using an Earnings Id with the W2 Category set to 20. These will be printed on Box 20.</p>
<p style="margin-left: 8px;">This release supports the processing of exempt earnings for the calculation of Box 14 Employment Income.</p>
<h3>12.13.2 Report PR Canadian <span style="font-weight: bold;">T4s</span></h3>
<p style="margin-left: 8px;">Pension Adjustments may be entered using Earning Id's with the W2 Category set to 52. These Pension Adjustment amounts will be printed in Box 52.</p>
<p style="margin-left: 8px;">RPP Contribution amounts should be entered using an Earnings Id with the W2 Category set to 20. These will be printed on Box 20.</p>
<p style="margin-left: 8px;">This release supports the processing of exempt earnings for the calculation of Box 14 Employment Income.</p>
<h5>12.13.2a Recent T4 Corrections</h5>
<p>This release corrects issues with the following T4 fields:</p>
<p>1. Union Dues reporting in Box 44<br />
2. Employee and Company Registered Pension Plan contributions in Box 52<br />
3. Any Earning or Deduction specifying an Other Information Box # (W-2 Category = OI:xx eg OI:40)</p>
<h2>12.14 Earnings Group</h2>
<h3>12.14.1 &#160;Earnings Tab</h3>
<p><span style="font-weight: bold;">Changed Field - Amount Type:</span><br />
A new Amount Type, Fixed (per Payroll Period), is available for Fringes. This could be used to record taxable, company-owned vehicle usage. Validation ensures that the Amount Type of Fixed may only be selected if all of the following are true:</p>
<p style="margin-left: 48px;">The Earnings Type is set to Fringe<br />
The Fringe is not Accrued<br />
The Fringe is not Job Costed</p>
<h3>12.14.2 Labor-to-GL Accruals</h3>
<p style="margin-left: 8px;">In previous releases, changing certain values (Hours, Pay Type, etc) didn't always cause the GL Accrual Info to be recalculated. &#160;The display only Accrual Info is now correctly re-initialized to ensure that accruals are calculated correctly in the Employee, Labor Journal, Payroll Period and Work Order viewers, and in Compute Payroll.</p>
<p style="margin-left: 8px;">This release corrects a recent issue where Labor Journal lines referencing a PayType with a RateFactor of 0.0 incorrectly generated GL Accrual postings.</p>
<p style="margin-left: 8px;">An override of the accumulated 'Earnings' when the Labor entry references specific Pay Type(s) specified in the Employee's Earnings tab allows an alternative way of determining overtime pay if overtime isn't at a 1.5 multiplier.&#160;This release extends support for this feature to the Earnings Group record. Click the Magnify button to access the Pay Type field.</p>
<h2>12.15&#160;Start Payroll GL Import</h2>
<p>This new Starter function will allow for the import of a PR GL file from a payroll service; currently, Wells Fargo is supported. A GL Journal entry will be created when this function is successfully run. Note that the v.rgstry must have PRInterface enabled in order to run this function.</p>
<p>Once the file is obtained from the payroll service, it should be loaded on your system at a location where your SAMPro user can browse to.</p>
<h3>Registry:</h3>
<p>The following registry is required to import payroll data from Wells Fargo.</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: bold;">Registry Id:</span> sys-start-sprglimprt</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: bold;">Setting Key:</span> &#160;Format &#160;&#160;&#160;<span style="font-weight: bold;">Setting Value:</span> WellsFargo</p>
<p>The Wells Fargo import file is comma-delimited. The first row is a header row, and is ignored by the import.</p>
<p>The columns are defined as follows:</p>
<p style="margin-left: 48px;">Columns 1-2: Wells Fargo info, skipped by the import</p>
<p style="margin-left: 48px;">Column 3: GL Account Id</p>
<p style="margin-left: 48px;">Column 4: GL Entity Id</p>
<p style="margin-left: 48px;">Column 5: Debits</p>
<p style="margin-left: 48px;">Column 6: Credits</p>
<p style="margin-left: 48px;">Columns 7-9: Skipped by the import</p>
<h3>Range Screen:</h3>
<p><font style="font-weight: bold;">Period Id:<br /></font>The Accounting Period these transactions will be assigned to.</p>
<p><font style="font-weight: bold;">Effective Date:<br /></font>The effective date of the transactions: this date must fall within the Accounting Period.</p>
<p><font style="font-weight: bold;">Transaction Description:<br /></font>This field will be used to generate the Description in the GL Journal header generated when this function is run.</p>
<p><font style="font-weight: bold;">Path Name of Import File:<br />
Browse Files Button:<br /></font>Enter the name of the file that you wish to import or use the button to bring up a browser to help you do so.</p>
<p><font style="font-weight: bold;">Preview File Button:<br /></font>Once you have selected a file, this button enables you to view its contents to confirm that it is the correct one. If the file format is incorrect, the system will warn you that ‘The Specified File Does Not Appear To Be A Properly Formatted Payroll Import File’.</p>
<p><img src="image/SKIN1_Go.gif" alt="" style="border: none;" border="0" /> &#160;When you are satisfied that the correct import file is selected, click the Go button. The system will confirm that the file has been imported. You will only be allowed to import properly formatted files.</p>
<p>The following validations will be made:</p>
<p style="margin-left: 48px;">A test is made to check the total debits in the import file against the total debits in any GL Journal entry; if these are equal, the user will be warned that this file may already have been posted, and the use is given the opportunity to proceed or exit.&#160;&#160;Multiple GL Journal entries could possibly show in the warning message.</p>
<p style="margin-left: 48px;">The system will validate that total debits = total credits.</p>
<p style="margin-left: 48px;">The system will validate that all GL Accounts and GL Entities referenced in the file actually exist in the database.</p>
<h2>12.16 Earnings Viewer</h2>
<p style="font-weight: bold;">Changed Field - Type:</p>
<p>N/A has been changed to <span style="font-weight: bold;">Burden</span> to better describe it's use for Job Cost Burden records.</p>
<p>A new Type of <span style="font-weight: bold;">Standard Cost</span> has been added. This Type would be selected if the client wished to avoid posting pay rate-based costs to Job History for privacy reasons for some or all of its employees. For this setup:</p>
<p style="margin-left: 48px;">Earnings records of Type Wage would have the Job Cost Labor Entry and Job Cost PR Check fields blank. &#160;</p>
<p style="margin-left: 48px;">One or more Earnings record of Type Standard Cost would be created with one of the Job Cost fields flagged.</p>
<p style="margin-left: 48px;">Each employee this setup applies to would have a Wages line and a Standard Cost line on their Employee Earnings Tab. The Wages line would be used for computing payroll, but the Standard Cost line would be used for Job Cost reporting that managers and other personnel might have access to.</p>
<h2>12.17 Labor Journal</h2>
<p>This release corrects a spurious 'Please clear line '#' and re-enter Bonus Amount') message when using Insert/Copy to enter multiple lines with the Bonus field completed.</p>
<p>This release corrects Job Override JCH calculations when the Earnings Group defaults from the Work Order's Job.</p>
<p style="margin-left: 8px;"><span style="font-weight: bold;">Changed Field - Payroll Period Id:</span><br />
Validation now prevents changing the Payroll Period on an existing entry from one that has Accrue to GL enabled to one with Accrual to GL disabled and vice versa.</p>
<p style="margin-left: 8px;"><span style="font-weight: bold;">Changed Field - Extra?:</span><br />
This release provides enhanced validation when copying/editing lines to prevent the Extra box from being checked for billing items that do not "allow extras."&#160;&#160;</p>
<h3>12.17.1 Validations</h3>
<p style="margin-left: 8px;">When the Payroll Period defaults in or is changed, the parent Effective Date will be changed if needed to ensure it falls within the selected Pay Period.</p>
<p style="margin-left: 8px;">Validation is now performed on a line by line basis to ensure that the Accounting Period is active (if the Effective Date falls within the Accounting Period) and that the Accrual Accounting Period is active (if the Effective Date falls within the Accrual Accounting Period). Additional validation prevents the Payroll Period from being changed if any detail lines have been entered.</p>
<h3>12.17.2 Main Tab</h3>
<p style="margin-left: 8px; font-weight: bold;">New Button:</p>
<p><font style="font-weight: bold;"><img src="ResetRates.bmp" alt="" style="border: none;" border="0" /></font> &#160;If an employee's pay (earnings) rate was changed mid-pay period, clicking the new Reset Rates button automatically recomputes each line in the selected Labor Journal entry, and asks the user to confirm the change. Previously, the entry had to be edited manually to force the recompute.</p>
<p>A new customization file is required to access the new button if upgrading to this build did NOT trigger a database conversion. Contact your Support representative if the new button does not appear (note that you may have to scroll down the Main tab to access the button).</p>
<h3>12.17.3 Hours Tab</h3>
<p style="margin-left: 8px;"><span style="font-weight: bold;">HrsBll:</span><br />
If Start and Stop Times are displayed via customization, the Billable Hours field now appears to the right of Actual Hours. Billable Hours will also appear on the Detail view.</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: bold;">PR-to-GL Accruals:</span><br />
In previous releases, accruals were skipped for Standard Cost type Earnings record when an Overhead Jobs was specified. In this release, accruals are correctly posted for Standard Cost Earnings for Jobs that are not Direct.</p>
<h3>12.17.4 Special Federal/State Tax Rates for Bonus Pay</h3>
<p style="font-weight: bold;">Labor Journal Hours Tab Detail View</p>
<p>Note: a new v.cus file may be needed to see these fields if a data-conversion was not triggered when upgrading to this version.</p>
<p>This enhancement eliminates the need to edit the Employee record before and after bonus checks are run in order to apply a Federal Income Tax (and if needed, State) &#160;flat rate to bonus pay. &#160;See Customer Note 12.2.5a for additional Usage instructions and details to running Bonus Check with this newer methodology.</p>
<p style="font-weight: bold;">New Fields:</p>
<p style="font-weight: bold;">Federal Tax Rate:<br />
State Tax Rate:<br />
<span style="font-weight: normal;">These fields provide a flat rate override to the Federal / State Income Tax rate brackets in the Employee's Federal (FED-M or FED-S) and State Tax Tables. These fields are intended to be used for Bonus pay only. If these field are blank, the Federal / State Tax Table will be used as before.</span> <span style="font-weight: normal;">Tax is on Total Earnings when using this option. If this is not desired, the old methodology of changing the Employee record's Tax tab to specify a flat tax FED-bonus entry may be used instead.</span></p>
<p style="font-weight: bold;">Changed Field - Bonus:<br />
<span style="font-weight: normal;">Since a Bonus should never be entered on a line which also records hours; validation has been added to prevent the user from entering hours and a Bonus on the same line.</span></p>
<h2>12.18 Compute Overtime Enhancement When Checks are Not Printed/Posted</h2>
<p>This release extends the functionality of the Overtime calculator work even when checks are not actually printed and posted. To accomplish this, registry settings have been enabled to change the functionality of the Payroll Period's Post History button to generate Job and GL History as well as Payroll History (default functionality). &#160;Note that the Post History button must be clicked after Compute Overtime and Compute Payroll have been run.</p>
<h3>12.18.1 Registries</h3>
<p>In addition to the existing registries required for Start Compute Overtime (in sys-start-scmpteovrtme and sys-strart-scmptepryll), the following registries are available to enable/control this Compute Overtime enhancement.</p>
<h5>Start Compute Overtime Registry</h5>
<p><span style="font-weight: bold;">Id:</span> sys-start-scmpteovrtme</p>

<span style="font-weight: bold;">Setting Key:</span> IncludeSickHours&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;<span style="font-weight: bold;">Setting Value:</span>Y &#160;(default N)</p>
<p>The existing registry options for sys-start-scmpteovrtme must also be set (see Help for Registry Start Compute Overtime).</p>
<h5>Start Compute Payroll Registry</h5>
<p><span style="font-weight: bold;">Id:</span> sys-compute-payroll</p>
<p>These settings specify the hours that are to be considered 'regular' hours when the Compute Payroll function is run. The user will be warned if the user's regular hours exceed 40 (or the value set via registry) as a reminder to run Compute Overtime first.</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: bold;">Setting Key:</span> RegularHoursIncludesHoliday&#160;&#160;<span style="font-weight: bold;">Setting Value:</span> true &#160;(default false)<br />

<h3>12.18.2 Payroll Procedure for Overtime Calculation</h3>
<p>1. Verify that all registry setting have been properly entered.</p>
<p>2. Enter labor for a Payroll Period which has the Accrued to GL box flagged.</p>
<p>2. When the entries for the Payroll Period have been completed, run Start Compute Overtime.</p>
<p>3. Next run Start Compute Payroll.</p>
<p>4. In the Payroll Period viewer, click the Post History button to generate Payroll, Job Cost and GL History without printing / posting checks.</p>
<p>5. Run the reports used to generate information for your payroll service.</p>
<h2>12.19 Workers Comp Category</h2>
<h3>12.19.1 Support for Security Filtering</h3>
<p style="margin-left: 8px;">This enhancement is applicable to a scenario where the WC state from the Job is used to determine the Cost Cat Workers Comp codes to use in the Labor Journal and WO Labor tab.&#160;In addition, unique Security-specific WC codes are implemented for each company containing the proper rates, and then added multiple WC codes with the same state to the cost category.&#160;&#160;Previously, when the system matches up the Job WC state to the Job Cost Category WC Code, it did not stay within the same security and just selected the first one on the list.&#160;</p>
<p style="margin-left: 8px;">In this release, Security has been built into this matching process so that it uses the appropriate WC code for the company that the job/labor journal transaction resides in.</p>
<h1>13 TimeAnywhere</h1>
<p>&#160;</p>
<h2>13.1 TimeAnywhere 1.0</h2>
<p>&#160;</p>
<h2>13.2 TimeAnywhere 2</h2>
<p>This release provides an enhancement to support Process TimeAnywhere Files in a Sybase environment.</p>
<p style="margin-left: 8px;">The terminated employee warning is now ignored when posting labor to prevent posting failures.</p>
<p>The TimeAnywhere 2.0 web-browser interface provides the user with more screen real estate and convenience for time entry. Please contact your support representative for a Powerpoint illustrating the use of this new interface. This web application writes directly to the SAMPro database records discussed below.</p>
<p>TimeAnywhere 2.0 supports posting to the Start / Stop times in the Labor Journal if the employee <span id="BugEvents11">works past midnight (e.g., 11:00 PM - 12:30 AM).</span>&#160;<span>&#160;In this scenario the actual hours worked will be assigned to the date selected by the TimeAnywhere user; the entry will NOT be broken into two entries (for hours before and after midnight).</span></p>
<h3><span>13.2.1 Employee Viewer Setup - Other Tab</span></h3>
<p><span style="font-weight: bold;">R</span><span id="BugEvents112" style="font-weight: bold;">emote Time Sheet Style (</span><span>may be labeled</span> <span style="font-weight: bold;">TimeAnywhere Type):</span><br />

<p style="margin-left: 48px;">If a Foreman, for example, has a customized field placing him in the East district, he will be able to enter information for himself even if his User registry is set to West. For the Foreman to be able to enter information for other Techs in the East and West districts, his User registry should list both- East,West. Note that a Foreman will always be able to enter time for himself even if his value is not included in the User Registry.</p>

<h1>14 Quoting</h1>
<h2>14.1 Quote Registries</h2>
<h3>14.1.1 Setting up for Quote Manager and Quote Scope</h3>
<p>If you will be using the new Quote Manager / Quote Scope viewers and/or CRMAnywhere, some of the entries in your existing Quotemaster (sys-viewer-vqte) registry record must be copied to the sys-viewer-vqtemngr registry for the Quote Manager, and others to the new sys-viewer-vqtescpe registry for the Quote Scope Viewer.</p>
<p style="font-weight: bold; margin-left: 40px;"><span><span style="font-weight: bold;">TIP: Cloning Your Quote Entries</span></span></p>
<p style="margin-left: 40px;">The easiest way of transferring your existing Quotemaster entries to the new viewers is to clone them. Note that the existing registry sys-viewer-vqte should NOT be changed as it supports the older Quotemaster viewer.</p>
<p style="font-size: 8pt; margin-top: 3.5pt; margin-left: 40px;">1. Access the sys-viewer-vqte registry.</p>
<p style="font-size: 8pt; margin-top: 3.5pt; margin-left: 40px;">2. Change the Id to sys-viewer-vqtemngr and tab out of the Id field.</p>
<p style="font-size: 8pt; margin-top: 3.5pt; margin-left: 40px;">3. Delete or disable any lines not supported by Quote Manager; they will be ignored by the system but may confuse users editing this registry in the future.</p>
<p style="font-size: 8pt; margin-top: 3.5pt; margin-left: 40px;">4. Reconfigure any disabled or required fields entries.</p>
<p style="font-size: 8pt; margin-top: 3.5pt; margin-left: 40px;">5. Save the new registry.</p>
<p style="margin-top: 3.5pt; margin-left: 40px;"><span style="font-size: 8pt;"><font size="1" style="font-size:8pt;">6. Repeat steps 1-5 for the Quote Scope registry (sys-viewer-vqtescpe).</font></span></p>
<h3>14.1.2 Registry to Relax Credit Hold Processing</h3>
<p>In Version 9.0.572.017, Credit Hold processing was tightened up so that if either the Days Credit Hold or Credit Limit set on the Client are exceeded, a new Work Order generated by the Wizard would be put on Credit Hold.</p>
<p>The following registry has been added to allow the user to return to the old default behavior so that a new Work Order is ONLY put on Credit Hold if the Site or Client is flagged as Credit Hold. The Client's Credit Limit and Days Credit Hold will be ignore.</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: bold;">Registry Id:</span> sys-viewer-vqte</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: bold;">Registry Id:</span> sys-viewer-vqtemngr</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: bold;">Setting Key:</span> IgnoreCreditHoldDaysLimit&#160;&#160;<span style="font-weight: bold;">Setting Value:</span> true (default false)</p>
<h3>14.1.3 Registry to Not Update Work Order NTE Amounts when Approval Wizard Runs</h3>
<p>In version 9.0.572.037, the Quote Manager's and Quote Master's Approval Wizards were revised to set the Work Order's Sub NTE set from the sum of the Extended Costs on the approved Sub Scope lines, and the Work Order's Client NTE from the sum of the Extended Prices and Revenue Adjustments on the approved Scope lines (Revenue Adjustments not included). This was done to support SubAnywhere.</p>
<p>This functionality was not in alignment with the business practices of certain customers, a registry is available to override the new default behavior. When the following registry is set to false and the approval wizard is run, the Client and Sub NTE of new work orders will be 0, and the Client and Sub NTE's existing work orders will not be changed. For Both Quote Master and Quote Manager:</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: bold;">Id:</span> sys-viewer-vwrkordr</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: bold;">Setting Key:</span> UpdateNTEAmounts &#160;<span style="font-weight: bold;">Setting Value:</span> false (default is true)</p>
<p>Note that this registry is set the Work Order registry!</p>
<h3>14.1.4 Use Crystal Quote Registry</h3>
<p>In a previous release, we corrected an issue where the Quote ID did not auto-fill when the Print Quote button was clicked when creating more than one quote in Quote Manage / Quote Master. But users for Crystal Reports Quote Form want the Report Form id to be blank so that it can run a third party app. This release supports a registry key to override the default behavior. When this is set to true the Quote will allow blanks in the Report Id to allow Crystal Reports to run.</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: bold;">Id:</span> sys-viewer-vqte<br style="color: #000000; font-family: Verdana, 'Helvetica Neue', Helvetica, Arial, sans-serif; font-size: 14px; font-style: normal; font-variant-ligatures: normal; font-variant-caps: normal; font-weight: normal; letter-spacing: normal; orphans: 2; text-align: start; text-indent: 0px; text-transform: none; white-space: normal; widows: 2; word-spacing: 0px; -webkit-text-stroke-width: 0px; text-decoration-style: initial; text-decoration-color: initial;" />

<h2>14.2 Quote Reports</h2>
<h3>14.2.1 <span style="font-weight: bold;">Report Quote Recap</span></h3>
<p>Sectionkey support has been added to the Report Quote Recap to support its use in CRMAnywhere. See Customer Release Note 15.2.3 for details on the report and registry settings needed for its use in CRMAnywhere.</p>
<p>This release corrects a sporadic problem where Use Tax did not appear on this report.</p>
<h3>14.2.2 Report Quote Form (Standard)</h3>
<p>The revised Report Quote (RQTEFRMv90b035.rpt) dated 2019-08-23 includes a new option, Show Grand Total Only. This report also displays the Quote's Expiration Date below the Quote's Date, and reprints the Scope heading (Option #1 (Continued)) when the Scope spans multiple pages.&#160;&#160;</p>
<h3>14.2.2a Report Quote Form Supports Bitmap Override by Job</h3>
<p>The revised Report Quote Form (RQTEFRMv90b035.rpt) dated 2018-05-14 supports the new bitmap override by Job functionality; the Quote must specify a header Job for this functionality. Note that this functionality only applies to the bitmap, not the sectionbackerbitmap.</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: bold;">Registry Id:</span> sys-report-rqtefrm</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: bold;">Setting Key:</span> &#160;BitmapOverrideBasedOn &#160;&#160;<span style="font-weight: bold;">Setting Value:</span> job</p>
<p>This registry entry defines that this override is based on a user field in the quote's Job record.</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: bold;">Setting Key:</span> BitmapOverrideField&#160;&#160;<span style="font-weight: bold;">Setting Value:</span> <span style="font-style: italic;"><i>job user database field</i></span></p>
<p>This registry entry specifies exactly Job User field will provide the override for the base 'Setting Key: bitmap'. &#160;The database field name must be specified.</p>
<p style="margin-left: 48px;">For example, the following specifies the Job's User 3 field:</p>
<p style="margin-left: 48px;">Setting Key: BitmapOverrideField&#160;&#160;Setting Value: jb_usr3</p>
<p style="margin-left: 8px;"><span style="font-weight: bold;">Setting Key:</span> Job~<span style="font-style: italic;"><i>string</i></span> &#160;&#160;<span style="font-weight: bold;">Setting Value:</span> <span style="font-style: italic;"><i>path\bitmap.</i></span>bmp</p>
<p style="margin-left: 8px;">This entry provide the override bitmap file that will be used if the Job record's User field defined above contains the string specified. Notice that a tilde (~) separates Job from the string. As many of these entries may be made as needed to support the various bitmaps.</p>
<p style="margin-left: 48px;">Example:</p>
<p style="margin-left: 48px;">Suppose that we have a bitmap file named 010101_quote.bmp that should be used on quotes associated with Job's having the following text string 010101 in Job User 3 fields.</p>
<p style="margin-left: 48px;">Setting Key: Job~010101 &#160;Setting Value: <span style="font-style: italic;"><i>path\</i></span>010101_quote.bmp</p>
<p style="margin-left: 8px;"><span style="font-weight: bold;">Tip:</span> Include the part of the bitmap name as the text string for clarity.</p>
<p style="margin-left: 8px;"><span style="font-weight: bold;">Tip:</span> Including the appropriate values in your job templates will ensure that new jobs are created properly. In addition, using the Custom Fields functionality to specify the allowed values will prevent inappropriate values from being entered.</p>
<h2>14.3 Quote Manager Viewer</h2>
<h3>Purpose:</h3>
<p>The Quote Manager Viewer provides a streamlined approach to Quoting. This viewer enables the user to specify the Site and Opportunity (for CRMAnywhere users) the Quote is for, as well as the Job or Work Order to be used when the Quote is posted.</p>
<h3>Usage:</h3>
<p>Quotes that were originally generated in the Quote Viewer may be updated, printed and posted from Quote Manager (for header information) and the Quote Scope Viewer (for detail Scope Option information).</p>
<h3>Registry:</h3>
<p>The Quote Manager registry (sys-viewer-vqtemngr ) and the Quote Scope registry (sys-viewer-vqtescpe) are used by these new viewers. The Quote registry sys-viewer-vqte is used by the Quote Manager Approval Wizard. See Customer Note 14.1.1 for details.</p>
<h5>Important Fields: Upper Section</h5>

This field defaults from the Inventory Item’s Inventory Group if it is not manually set before you enter the Inventory Item Id. If you double-click on this field &#160;to set it manually, the list will be filtered to Job Cost Categories with a cost type of Material.</p>
<p><font style="font-weight: bold;">Inventory Item Id</font>:<br />
Enter a valid Inventory Item Id or double-click to select from a list.</p>
<p>If a superseded part number is entered into this field, the system will alert the user that "Item A has been superceded by Item B. Use New Item?" It the user clicks Yes, the new part (B) will be returned to the field. If the user clicks No, part A (which has been superceded) will remain in the field.</p>
<p><font style="font-weight: bold;">Tax Type Id:</font><br />
This field defaults based on the on the Job’s Tax status and the Cost Category.</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: bold;">UOM:</span><br />
Displays the Unit of Measure from the Inventory record.</p>
<p><font style="font-weight: bold;">Vendor Id</font>:<br />
Complete this field if the part will be ordered from a Vendor rather than pulled from stock; inactive Vendors may not be selected. &#160;If you specify a Vendor, a Purchase Order will be generated when the quote is approved. Validation prevents the Vendor Id from being completed on negative quantity Inventory and Material lines when the Quote is saved/added.</p>
<p><font style="font-weight: bold;">PO Id</font>:<br />
If you have completed the Vendor Id, this field will be completed by the system when Approval Wizard is run (if the Quote option is accepted) and the PO generated.</p>
<p class="Block_Text">If these items should be appended to an existing PO, enter the PO Id. The approved lines will be added to the existing PO (rather than creating a new one).</p>
<p><font style="font-weight: bold;">Unit Cost Extended Cost<br /></font>The unit cost for this item defaults from the Flat Rate Category (if selected) or from the Inventory Item. The system calculates the extended cost by multiplying the Quantity times the Unit Cost.</p>
<p><font style="font-weight: bold;">Unit Price Extended Price<br /></font>If this option is not Fixed Price (which requires that these fields be $0), and this Inventory Item is not flagged as ‘Use Unit Price’, the price for this item is calculated from the Inventory Item/Rate Schedule fields or is calculated based on the Cost and Gross Margin or Percent Markup calculations. The system calculates the extended price by multiplying the Quantity times the Unit Price.</p>
<p>If an Inventory Item flagged as ‘Use Unit Price’ is selected, the Material Price Level from the Client Site will be used to determine which level Unit Price will default.</p>
<p style="margin-left: 48px;"><font style="font-weight: bold;">Price Code Handling:<br /></font>The Inventory Item allows for 10 levels of Material Pricing, but Price Codes only allow for 5. If price codes are in effect, and the default price level from the Client Site is greater than 5, the system now defaults price level 1 from the Price Code. A registry entry <a href="Registry_Entry_Global_Settings__Column_Compression__Dispatch_Board_Rows__History_Log_Inventory_Markup.htm#globel_settings_price_code">Price Code Handling (sys-ffv-global-settings)</a> is available to always default the value from the Price Code level 1, regardless of the Material Price Level in the Client Site.</p>
<p><font style="font-weight: bold;">Description:<br /></font>This field defaults from the Inventory Item record but may be adjusted by the user if needed.</p>
<p><font style="font-weight: bold;">Vendor Part Number:<br /></font>The Vendor’s Part Number for this item , if available. This will be written to the PO if the line is approved.</p>

<p class="Tab">Material Tab</p>
<p>This tab should be used to enter non-inventoried material. The Quote Scope uses the same rules as the Work Order for the inclusion of the tax cost (if applicable) to allow for proper markup and GM% calculation for lines entered directly on the Quote, as well as from Flat Rates.</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: bold;">Quantity:</span><br />
The quantity of the material being quoted.</p>
<p style="font-weight: bold;">Other Rate Id:<br />
<span style="font-weight: normal;">This optional field may be used to specify miscellaneous materials or other items on quotes; it may default in the Cost Category.</span></p>
<p style="font-weight: bold;"><span style="font-weight: normal;">V</span>endor Id:<br />
<span style="font-weight: normal;">The Vendor from which you wish to obtain this material; inactive Vendors may not be selected. Validation prevents the Vendor Id from being completed on negative quantity Inventory and Material lines when the Quote is saved/added.</span></p>
<p><font style="font-weight: bold;"><span style="font-weight: bold;">P</span>O Id</font>:<br />
If you have completed the Vendor Id, this field will be completed by the system when Approval Wizard is run (if the Quote option is accepted) and the PO generated. &#160;If these items should be appended to an existing PO, enter the PO Id.

<p><font style="font-weight: bold;">Unit Cost: &#160;&#160;Extended Cost:<br /></font>The unit cost for this item defaults from the Flat Rate Category (if selected) or may be entered by the user. The system calculates the extended cost by multiplying the Quantity times the Unit Cost.</p>
<p><font style="font-weight: bold;">Unit Price: Extended Price:<br /></font>If this option is not Fixed Price (which requires that these fields be $0), the price for this item defaults from the Rate Schedule fields or is calculated based on the Cost and Gross Margin or Percent Markup calculations. The system calculates the extended price by multiplying the Quantity times the Unit Price.</p>
<p><font style="font-weight: bold;">Description:<br /></font>This field should contain a brief description of the material.</p>
<p><font style="font-weight: bold;">Vendor Part Number:<br /></font>The Vendor’s Part Number for this item, if available. This will be written to the PO if the line is approved.</p>
<p><font style="font-weight: bold;">Vendor Quote Number:<br /></font>If the Vendor provided you with Quote number, enter it here. It will be included on the Vendor Approval Form.<br /></p>
<p class="Tab">Subcontractors Tab</p>
<p><font style="font-weight: bold;">Quantity:<br /></font>The quantity of the subbed work being quoted.</p>
<p style="font-weight: bold;">Cost Category:<br />
<span style="font-weight: normal;">This required field normally defaults when you select a Vendor or Other Rate Id.

<p><font style="font-weight: bold;">Other Rate Id</font>:<br />
This optional field is typically used to specify standard subcontractor charges. &#160;It will in turn default the Cost Category.</p>
<p style="margin-left: 48px;"><span style="font-weight: bold;">Note:</span> If the Equipment specified on a Scope references a Service Provider Rate Schedule, then any Other Rate Id's specified on the Sub tab default the Unit Cost values from the Equipment's Service Provider Rate Schedule table instead of the one referenced in the Vendor record.</p>
<p><font style="font-weight: bold;">Vendor Id</font>:<br />
The vendor from which you wish to obtain this material; inactive Vendors may not be selected.</p>
<p>Validation requires a Vendor Id to be entered on Subcontract lines when that option is approved. This prevents an invalid Technician from being associated with Subcontract lines, and the PO post from failing because a Vendor was not specified. &#160;</p>
<p><font style="font-weight: bold;"><span style="font-weight: bold;">P</span>O Id</font>:<br />
This field will be completed by the system when Approval Wizard is run (if the Quote option is accepted) and the PO generated. &#160;If these charges should be appended to an existing PO, enter the PO Id. The approved lines will be added to the existing PO (rather than creating a new one).</p>
<p><font style="font-weight: bold;">Unit Cost Extended Cost<br /></font>The unit cost for this item defaults from the Flat Rate Category (if selected) or may be entered by the user. The system calculates the extended cost by multiplying the Quantity times the Unit Cost.</p>

<p><font style="font-weight: bold;">Quantity:<br /></font>The number of units being quoted (e.g., backhoe hours, mileage, permits, etc.).</p>
<p style="font-weight: bold;">Cost Category:<br />
<span style="font-weight: normal;">This field is required; it typically defaults from the Other Rate Id.</span></p>
<p style="font-weight: bold;"><span style="font-weight: normal;">O</span>ther Rate Id:<br />
<span style="font-weight: normal;">Enter a valid Other Rate Id or double-click to select from a list (for example, permits, fees, etc.).</span></p>
<p><font style="font-weight: bold;">Tax Type Id:</font><br />
The appropriate Tax Type for this line; this field is set based on the Quote Manager's Tax Type and Cost Category.</p>
<p><font style="font-weight: bold;">Unit Cost Extended Cost<br /></font>The unit cost for this defaults from the Flat Rate Category (if selected) or may be entered by the user. The system calculates the extended cost by multiplying the Quantity times the Unit Cost.</p>

<p><font style="font-weight: bold;">Description:<br /></font>This field defaults from the Other Rate record (if specified). It should contain a brief description of the charge.<br /></p>
<p class="Tab">Addtnl Equipment Tab</p>
<p>This tab is used to append additional equipment to this Scope.</p>
<p class="Block_Text"><span style="font-weight: bold;">Equipment Id:<br /></span>Enter an Equipment Id to add it onto this option for reporting purposes. The system will <font style="text-decoration: underline;">not</font> factor in multiple quantities to account for additional equipment listed on this tab when work orders or purchase orders for this Quote are generated. Multiple quantities must be set either when Importing a Flat Rate (on the scope tab), or by entering them directly on the detail lines.<br /></p>
<p class="Tab">RevAdjust Tab</p>
<p class="Reference_Line" style="margin-bottom: 0.00pt;">Revenue adjustments enable you apply discount and management fees to the quote total. Saving this Scope, or clicking the Adjust Revenue button on the Quote Manager Managers tab populates this tab with adjustments based on the Revenue Adjustment record(s) for each Scope tab. When the Quote is approved and a Work Order is generated the information on this tab will be applied to the Work Order's RevAdjust tab.&#160;</p>
<p><font style="font-weight: bold;">Invoice Description:<br /></font>This field will be printed next to this discount or addition on the printed quote and invoice generated from this quote (e.g., ‘Loyal Customer Discount’). This field defaults from the Revenue Adjustment record.</p>

<p><font style="font-weight: bold;">AdjBase: Rate: Amount:</font><br />
For Discounts, the AdjBase would be typically be set to the Fixed or Total Quote amount for this option. The Rate should be set to the discount to be applied to this option. The Amount is calculated by the system by multiplying the Adjustment Base times the Rate. To deduct a specific dollar value, leave the AdjBase and Rate fields blank, and simply enter the amount.</p>
<p>‘Adds’ (such as management or trip fees) are generally entered as a flat amount. Both the Adjustment Base and the Rate will be blank, and the Amount will be the flat fee.</p>
<p><font style="font-weight: bold;">Cost Category:<br /></font> The default Cost Category for this adjustment.</p>
<p class="Reference_Line" style="margin-bottom: 0.00pt;"><font style="font-weight: bold;">GL Account Id:<br /></font> This field sets the default discount account for the entries that will be generated on the RevAdjust Work Order tab, and is typically an income type account.

<p><font style="font-weight: bold;">GL Entity:<br /></font>The default GL Entity for this adjustment. This field defaults from the Default Service Job Cost Code found in the Client Site Equipment referenced on the specified scope line.</p>
<p><font style="font-weight: bold;">PSeq#:<br /></font>The Print Sequence Number sets the order that multiple revenue adjustment lines will print on the invoice.</p>
<p><font style="font-weight: bold;">Tax Type:<br /></font>The Tax Type will default to "n/a" and will be evaluated and properly handled by invoicing should this quote become an actual work order.<br /></p>
<p class="Tab">Techs Tab</p>
<p>The Techs tab lists all Work Order Technician lines for Work Orders referenced by this Scope. When a line is right-clicked, a prompt appears displaying Work Order information. The Technician Status may be changed from this prompt.</p>
<h3>14.4.1 Recent Quote Scope Changes</h3>
<p>Quote Scopes now support revenues of up to $99,999,999. Previously, revenues of ten millions and above resulted in a tab mismatch error in both the Quote Master and Quote Scope viewers.</p>
<p>This release corrects a Runtime Error: 'CheckCurrentField Not Understood'. This error only occurred when clicking the Flat Rate Import button with the Subcontractor, Additional Equipment, Revenue Adjustment or Techs tab selected.</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: bold;">Quote Scope Viewer Scheduling Tab: Changed Fields: Opened By - Date Opened - Time Opened</span><br />
In previous releases, if a Scope was reopened, these fields were updated with the current User, Date and Time. &#160;In this release, these fields are only updated when they are blank when the Scope is initially created. &#160;This change provides better reporting information on when the scope was originally created.</p>
<p style="font-weight: bold;"><span style="font-weight: normal;">This release corrects a sporadic 'Record Not Found' error when attempting to change the Equipment Id in a previously saved Quote Scope record.</span> &#160;</p>
<p style="font-weight: bold;">Changed Fields: Rate Schedule, Gross Margin % - Markup %<br />
<span style="font-weight: normal;">If the Rate Schedule, Margin or Markup is changed, the system will recompute the prices on previously entered lines as needed. &#160;Only Scopes with a status of Open or Accepted (if enabled via registry) are eligible for the change. Clearing the Rate Schedule, Margin AND Markup fields (so that none are set) does NOT trigger the recompute.</span></p>
<p style="font-weight: bold;">New Button: <img src="Recompute.bmp" alt="" style="border: none;" border="0" /></p>
<p style="font-weight: bold;"><span style="font-weight: normal;">Clicking the Recompute Scope button will recompute the prices based on the Rate Schedule, Gross Margin % or Markup % This button is useful to use if the Rate Schedule has recently been changed. &#160;The button may only be used for Scopes with a status of Open or Accepted (if enabled via registry).</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: bold;">New Button:</span> <img src="CopyFromScope.bmp" alt="" style="border: none;" border="0" /></p>
<p>This enhancement extends the "Copy From" functionality to allow a Scope to be copied from any Quote, not just the one that the current Scope belongs to.</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: bold;">New Button:</span> <img src="ParentQuote.bmp" alt="" style="border: none;" border="0" /></p>
<p>Clicking the Parent Quote button on the Quote Scope accesses the Scope's Quote Manager record.</p>
<h2>14.5 Quotemaster (View Quote)</h2>
<p>The Import Diagnostic Costs Wizard is now supported in if a source Work Order is not specified. &#160;The Wizard verifies that the Site in the Quote / Quote Manager matches the Site of the Work Order selected.</p>
<p>The Import Diagnostic Cost Wizard now sets the Tax Type based on the Tax Group / Tax Status in the Quote / Quote Manager records. This prevents the this wizard from failing if the Tax Type Id ' n/a' is encountered in any of the Job History lines being imported (the could occur if the Tax Type was reset via the Work Order button).</p>
<p>If a Job (but no Work Order) is specified in the Quote viewer, the Approval Wizard now defaults the Job id from the Quote header. Previously, the Job only defaulted if a Work Order was specified.</p>
<p>This release corrects the setting of Status Category when all scopes are Approved but not all are fully Approved.</p>
<p>The display-only Extended Price on the Scope and Detail lines has been expanded from &#160;from decimal(8,2) to decimal (10,2) to support quotes up to $99,999,999.99. The changes to the Work Order Extended Prices support this enhancement.</p>
<h3>14.5.1 Quote Viewer - Main Tab</h3>
<p>The ServiceChannel Upload button has been removed from this tab because the quote/proposal integration has been disabled by ServiceChannel.</p>
<p style="font-weight: bold;">Changed Fields: Rate Schedule - Gross Margin - Markup Percent</p>
<p>These fields provide the defaults for the Options associated with this Quote. &#160;They may be overridden on the Option Tab.</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: bold;">Changed Field: Account Manager</span><br />
When a Quote is created, the system will default the Account Manager from the Site; it may be changed by the user if needed. When the Approval Wizard is run and a NEW work order is generated, SAMPro uses the Quote's Account Manager to write to the corresponding field in the newly generated Work Order.&#160;</p>
<p style="margin-left: 8px;"><span style="font-weight: bold;">Changed Fields: Tax Group Id: Tax Status:</span><br />
These fields are only used for determining estimate tax on the Quote report. When the Approval Wizard is run, the Tax Group and Tax Status in the selected Job are now used to when generating Work Order detail lines. &#160;</p>
<h3>14.5.2 Quote Viewer - Scope Tab</h3>
<p>Quote Scopes now support revenues of up to $99,999,99. Previously, revenues of ten millions and above resulted in a tab mismatch error in both the Quote Master and Quote Scope viewers.</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: bold;">Changed Fields: Opened By - Date Opened - Time Opened</span><br />
In previous releases, if a Scope was reopened, these fields were updated with the current User, Date and Time. &#160;In this release, these fields are only updated when they are blank when the Scope is initially created. &#160;This change provides better reporting information on when the scope was originally created.</p>
<p style="font-weight: bold;">New Fields: &#160;Rate Schedule - Gross Margin - Markup Percent</p>
<p>These fields override the corresponding fields located on the Quote's Main Tab.</p>
<p style="margin-left: 48px;"><font style="font-weight: bold;">Rate Schedule Id:</font><br />
The default Rate Schedule for generating this option. &#160;If this field is completed, the Gross Margin and Percent Markup fields must remain blank.</p>
<p style="margin-left: 48px;"><font style="font-weight: bold;">Gross Margin Percent</font>:<br />
The Gross Margin Percent to apply to costs associated with this Option. If this field is completed, the Rate Schedule and Percent Markup fields must remain blank.</p>
<p style="margin-left: 48px;"><font style="font-weight: bold;">Markup Percent</font>:<br />
The Percent Markup to associate with cost entered to complete this Option. If this field is completed, the Rate Schedule and Gross Margin fields must remain blank.</p>
<h3>14.5.3 Cloning a Quote</h3>
<p>We already do special processing to clear certain fields when the user types 'new' in the Quote Id field. In this release, the following fields will be also be cleared: the Scope tab's Equipment Ids, the WO Id and Job Id in the Main tab, and the new TechAnywhere fields.</p>
<h3>15.5.4 Inventory Tab</h3>
<p><span style="font-weight: bold;">Changed Field: Vendor Id</span><br />
An Inactive Vendor may not be selected.</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: bold;">New Field - UOM:</span><br />
Displays the Unit of Measure from the Inventory record.</p>
<h2>14.6 Quotemaster / Quote Scope Approval Wizard</h2>
<p>Previously, if the Approval wizard encountered the "WARNING: this work order has open assignments to a remote technician" the approval stopped. In this release, the warning is suppressed so the Approval wizard can run.</p>
<p>In this release, the Description entered on the Scope's Material tab will be accurately written to the Purchase Order (when a Vendor is specified). In previous releases, the Description from the Other Rate Id overwrote the Quote Material Tab when a Purchase Order was generated.</p>
<p>Previously,the new Work Order's Service Category was always set based on the Work Code. When creating a new Work Order, the Quote's Service Category (if completed) will be used to set the Work Order's Service Category. If the Quote's Service Category is empty, the new Work Order's Service Category will continue to be set based on the Work Code.</p>
<p>Since Payroll Period validation is not applicable to WO Labor flagged as Quoted, the Approval Wizard now ignores this validation when generating WO Labor lines.</p>
<p>When the Approval Wizard is run, the Tax Group and Tax Status in the selected Job are now used to when generating Work Order detail lines. &#160;</p>
<p style="margin-left: 8px;">When the Wizard writes back to the source Work Order, the Work Code on existing Equipment tab entries is retained. The Work Code from Quote / Quote Manager sets the Work Code on any newly generated Equipment lines.</p>
<p style="margin-left: 8px;">The Service Evaluation Id now defaults from the Scope's Site Equipment record when a new Work Order is created. For multiple Scopes/Equipment, the Service Evaluation associated with the Equipment on the first Scope processed will be used.</p>
<p style="margin-left: 8px;">When the Quote Approval Wizard is launched, the system now checks for Inactive Vendors. If a Vendor is inactive, the user is alerted and the Wizard is blocked from proceeding.</p>
<p style="margin-left: 8px;">The system checks to see if any Vendors in approved scopes are Blocked Purchase as of today. If so, the user is alerted and the Wizard is prevented from proceeding.</p>
<p style="margin-left: 8px;">New WO's are also put on Credit Hold if the Client's Days Credit Hold or Credit Limit are exceeded. Previously, only the Client/Site Credit Status was considered.</p>
<p style="margin-left: 8px;">This release corrects a problem in PO generation when one PO was updated and one was created for the same Vendor.</p>
<h3>14.6.1 Closed PO Validation</h3>
<p>The Quotemaster / Quote Manager Approval Wizard now check to see if the Date Closed is set on a Purchase Order it is set to update. &#160;The user is warned that "The following Purchase Orders are closed and cannot be updated". &#160;After clearing this message, the user has the option of proceeding or canceling the Wizard (so that the PO referenced in the Quote may be changed or cleared before rerunning the Wizard). Canceling the Wizard and correcting the problem is recommended.</p>
<p>If the user elected to continue and the post to the PO failed, the user will be warned, and a text file (ErrorLogForQuote_######_date_time) specifying the problem will be written to the directory named in the dbreportfiles registry.</p>
<h3>14.6.2 New Select Quote Documents Screen</h3>
<p>The new Select Quote Document screen ( following the Budget Screen) allows the user to select from the list of documents attached to the Quote to be attached to the Work Order.</p>
<p style="font-weight: bold; text-decoration: underline;">Select Quote Documents</p>
<p class="Reference_Line">This screen displays a list of documents attached to the Quote. The user may select documents that should get attached to any Work Orders created/updated by the wizard process.</p>
<p style="margin-left: 48px;"><span style="font-weight: bold;">ok</span><br />
Click the ok box to check the documents you wish to attach to the Work Order being updated or created.</p>
<p style="margin-left: 48px;"><span style="font-weight: bold;">Description: Category: File: Document Id:</span><br />
These display fields default from the Document record. &#160;The File displays the Document's file type.</p>
<h3>14.6.3 Approval Wizard Updates the Work Order Client and Sub NTE</h3>
<p>When a Work Order is created/updated from the Quote/Quote Manager, the Work Order's Sub NTE will be set from the sum of the Extended Costs on the approved Sub Scope lines. The Work Order's Client NTE will be set from the sum of the Extended Prices and Revenue Adjustments on the approved Scope lines, Revenue Adjustments &#160;included. In previous releases, the Approval Wizard did not update the Work Order's Client NTE or Sub NTE. Note that a registry entry suppressing the update of the Client NTE is available (UpdateNTEAmounts=false in sys-viewer-vwrkordr).</p>
<h3>14.6.4 Approval Wizard Job Budget</h3>
<p style="margin-left: 8px;">When the Job Budget option is selected, the Quote's Revenue Adjustments now generate a revenue Budget Entry (+ or -) to the Job and Cost Code specified. &#160;</p>
<p style="margin-left: 8px;">When the Job Budget option of the Quote Approval wizard is selected, Budgeted Revenues are now written for T&amp;M Quotes; previously only Budgeted Costs were written.</p>
<h3>14.6.5 Approval Wizard - WO Log Tab</h3>
<p style="margin-left: 8px;">The Approval Wizard now writes to the Work Order Log Tab when a new Work Order is created as well as when a Work Order is updated by the Wizard.</p>
<h2><span style="font-weight: bold;">14.7 Quote Master / Quote Scope Import Diagnostic Cost Wizard</span></h2>
<p style="margin-left: 8px;"><span style="font-weight: bold;">Changed Field - Work Order Id:</span><br />
The source Work Order from the Quote/Quote Manager defaults to the field. If there is no source Work Order, the user may enter an Id, or double-click to select from a filtered list of Work Orders associated with the Site in the Quote / Quote Manager record. &#160;</p>
<p style="margin-left: 8px;"><span style="font-weight: bold;">New Field - Import All Equipment:</span><br />
If this field is checked, any additional Equipment referenced on the Work Order's Equipment tab will be imported to the Scope's Equipment tab.</p>
<p style="margin-left: 8px;">This release corrects issues associated with importing Other and non-inventory Material Diagnostic Costs. Edited Work Order lines are also imported correctly in this release. In addition, the Work Order Other Tab Description will be imported to Quote lines when the Diagnostic Cost Wizard is run. In previous releases, the Other Rate's Description was used instead of the Description on the Work Order line.</p>
<h2><span style="font-weight: bold;">14.8 Import Flat Rate Wizard</span></h2>
<p style="margin-left: 8px;">This release corrects a display issue in the Quote and Quote Scope viewer where importing a Flat Rate did not update the Scope Of Services field until you clicked in it.</p>
<h1>15 CRMAnywhere</h1>
<h2>15.1 Overview</h2>
<p>The new CRMAnywhere is a powerful web-based module designed to give your company transparency and control in tracking your prospects’ progress from sales lead to customer. &#160;From initial contact to Quote, your Sales Reps can create Opportunities, track Milestones, and plan Activities and meetings that integrate with a Google calendar. It also allows the creation of Quotes for potential and existing clients. Contact your account manager for details on licensing this new module. Note that the Opportunity record is ONLY available if the new CRMAnywhere module is licensed on your system.</p>
<p class="MsoNormal">CRMAnywhere now features the ability to navigate multiple records at once, to reference information in a previous record when creating a new one. The most-recently opened viewer is the only one that can be edited- previous windows are marked “Read-Only” but can be moved, re-sized, brought into main focus, and copied from using ctrl + C to copy and paste information into the new record. This feature can be accessed through open records- open a Contact record, then use the Add Opportunity button, or click a linked record from the lower tabs to open a new Opportunity or Quote record. You are not able to open an Opportunity record, then click back to the main dashboard to open a Contact record from the Analytic- additional records must be accessed from the most recently-opened record.</p>

<h3>16.1.6 <span style="font-weight: bold;">Registry to turn On New Work Order GM Screen based on Job History / Projections</span></h3>
<p>By default, the Work Order's Gross Margin tab is based on information loaded into the Work Order record itself. When the following registry is enabled, a different Gross Margin tab will appear. This version of the Gross Margin tab is especially useful if Revenue Adjustments are entered to ensure that the Work Order NTE is not exceeded.</p>
<p>This tab displays information based on Job History; Revenue Adjustment projections will be also be displayed if actual values are not found in Job History. See Customer Note 16.1.6a for additional details. ONLY values for the Job referenced on the Work Order's Main tab will appear.</p>

<h3>16.1.6a New Work Order Gross Margin Tab (From Job History / Projections)</h3>
<p style="margin-left: 8px;">This tab will appear if the above registry is enabled. It displays information from in Job History as well as projections based on the selected Revenue Adjustment table. This information will help the user determine if any adjustments should be made to the Work Order to prevent its total invoiced amounts from exceeding the Client NTE. Note that ONLY values for the Job referenced on the Work Order's Main tab will appear.</p>
<p style="margin-left: 8px; font-weight: bold;">Important Fields / Buttons:</p>
<p style="margin-left: 8px;"><span style="font-weight: bold;">Gross Margin Id:<br />
Analyze Labor:&#160;&#160;Analyze Materials: Analyze Other:&#160;Analyze Subcontract:<br /></span>These display-only fields default from the Gross Margin table for this Work Order. If an Analyze box is checked, that category of costs/revenues will be included in the Gross Margin Analysis.</p>
<p style="margin-left: 8px;"><span style="font-weight: bold;">Revenue Adjustment Id:<br /></span>The Revenue Adjustment record used by the system when the Adjust Revenue button is clicked, and also for projected values if actual Job History values do not yet exist. The Rates, GL Accounts and Invoice Description from the header of this table are displayed below the UNBILLED and TOTAL sections of this screen.</p>
<p style="margin-left: 8px;"><img src="image/SKIN1_RefreshGM.gif" alt="image\SKIN1_RefreshGM.gif" title="image\SKIN1_RefreshGM.gif" width="88" height="28" border="0" /> Clicking this button refreshes the tab with current entries in Job History and any applicable projections from the Revenue Adjustment table. &#160;</p>

Clicking this button also imports all applicable costs into the Work Order so that any manual adjustments can be made easily.</p>
<p style="margin-left: 48px;"><span style="font-weight: bold;">Warning:</span> Clicking this button will delete any unbilled manual Revenue Adjustments on this Work Order.</p>
<p style="margin-left: 8px;"><span style="font-weight: bold;">Client NTE:</span><br />

<p style="margin-left: 48px;"><span style="font-weight: bold;">RevAdjust:<br /></span>If any Unbilled Revenue Adjustments (not netting to zero) for any cost type are found in Job History they will be used to generate these fields. Otherwise, the system will project the Revenue Adjustment values based on Unbilled Revenues and the Revenue Adjustment Id in the Work Order. &#160;The projected value will also be used if Unbilled Revenue Adjustments netting to zero across all values are found in Job History.</p>
<p style="margin-left: 88px;"><span style="font-weight: bold;">NOTE:</span> There cannot be a mixture of actual and projected Revenue Adjustments displayed on the screen. For example, if an unbilled Revenue Adjustment for labor exists in Job History, that will be displayed on the Gross Margin tab: any projected values for material, other or subcontract costs will not appear. &#160;</p>
<p style="margin-left: 88px;">Clicking the Adjust Revenue button allows you to import costs and make the actual Revenue Adjustment entries in the Work Order and to Job History. When you save the Work Order and refresh the Gross Margin screen, the actual unbilled Revenue Adjustments will appear on the Gross Margin tab.</p>

<h3>16.1.6b Work Order Registry to Deny Manual Entry of Negative Inventory Lines</h3>
<p><span style="font-weight: bold;">Registry Id:</span> sys-viewer-vwrkordr</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: bold;">Setting Key:</span> AllowNegativeInventoryQuantity</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: bold;">Setting Values:</span> true &#160;&#160;&#160;(default is false)</p>
<p>Implementing this registry setting prevents the user from manually entering negative Inventory lines on the Work Order Inventory tab. &#160;Typically, this would be enabled to require IM ADJUSTMENT transactions to be made to "return" items to a stocking location. &#160;Ideally, the Return Wizard process to would be used to do so. This type of transaction influences the Average Cost Calculation whereas direct WO Inventory activity does not.</p>
<p style="margin-left: 48px;"><span style="font-weight: bold;">WARNING:</span> As of this release, this new option is applied to both the Actual and the Billable quantities. &#160;With the new option enabled one cannot give a billing credit (negative Billable Qty) to adjust and/or correct an invoice.</p>
<h3>16.1.7 TechFinder Registry to Control WO Status Category &#160;(Allow WaitCustApprvl)</h3>
<p>In previous releases, the system was hard-coded to only allow Work Orders with a Status Category of Open or Completed. &#160;However the WaitCustApprvl escalation and tech statuses map to a Status Category of Pending Ok To Start, which meant that these WO would never appear on the TechFinder viewer.</p>
<p>In this release, a new registry has been added to override the default Status Category limit for TechFinder. Which enabled, all Status Categories are allowed. &#160;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: bold;">Registry Id:</span> sys-tech-finder</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: bold;">Setting Key:</span> WOStatusCategorySQL &#160;<span style="font-weight: bold;">Setting Value:</span> wrkordr.wrkordr_stts_ctgry like '%'</p>
<p>NOTE: if the above setting in in please, the Work Orders shown on TechFinder will continue to be filtered by the default Tech and WO Escalation Statuses (or those set by the TechStatusSQL and WOStatusSQL settings).</p>
<h3>16.1.8 &#160;Registry to Override NewWorkOrderStatus for Preventative Maintenance Work Orders</h3>
<p>This registry should be set to enable Preventative Maintenance Work Orders (generated by Create PM Work Orders) to be assigned a special status when they are created even when NewWorkOrderStatus is set (which trumps the older StatusForPreventiveMaint registry option).</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: bold;">Registry Id:</span> sys-web-access-none and sys-web-access-technician</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: bold;">Setting Key:</span> OverrideNewWorkOrderStatus <span style="font-weight: bold;">Setting Value:</span> <span style="font-style: italic;"><i>astatus</i></span></p>
<h3>16.1.8a Registry to Override Status of PM Work Orders With ReqResource Parts</h3>
<p style="margin-left: 8px;"><span style="font-weight: bold;">Registy Id:</span> sys-start-scrtepmwo<br />
<span style="font-weight: bold;">Setting Key:</span> ReqPMPartsStatus &#160;&#160;&#160;<span style="font-weight: bold;">Setting Value:</span> <span style="font-style: italic;"><i>status</i></span></p>
<p style="margin-left: 8px;">By default, PM Work Orders which were generated with any ReqResource lines were ALWAYS set to Waiting Parts. This registry provides an override so that users can specify a different status for PM's with ReqResource parts.</p>
<p style="margin-left: 48px;">Example: To set PM's with ReqResource lines to Waiting Service:</p>
<p style="margin-left: 48px;">Id: sys-start-scrtepmwo<br />
Setting Key: ReqPMPartsStatus &#160;&#160;Setting Value: Waiting Service</p>
<h3>16.1.9 Prevent User from Editing WO Other Tab Lines Imported from a PO</h3>
<p>If the user changes the description of a Gen Item after it is imported into the WO from a source PO a disconnect is created when running Create EOM Unvouchered AP GL Entries (seomunvchrdap). Those changed lines will not be included in the GL Journal written by the function.</p>
<p>A registry has been added to previous these lines from being changed on the Work Order's Other tab. If the following registry is implemented, the system will display an error message if the user attempts to change the description on an Other tab line associated with a PO and imported from JCH. Note that the Setting Value is false to implement this behavior.</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: bold;">Registry Id:</span> sys-viewer-vwrkordr</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: bold;">Setting Key:</span> AllowEditOfPOGENDescriptions &#160;&#160;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: bold;">Setting Value:</span> false &#160;(Default is true to preserve current behavior)</p>
<h2>16.2 Reports</h2>
<h3>16.2.1 Service Invoice</h3>
<p>See Customer Note 8.2.1a for details on implementing an enhancement to attach TechAnywhere Receipts and Other Documents to Emailed Service Invoices and to Skip Print Emailed Service Invoices.</p>
<h3>16.2.2 Work Order Field Ticket Standard (woticket-db.rpt)</h3>
<p>The revised report dated 2016-02-25 adds an option to Skip PO Summary. In addition, Multi-page textbox processing was added for the Work Requested field. &#160;</p>
<h3><span style="font-weight: bold;">16.2.3 Report PM Agreement Summary (RPMAGRMNT)</span></h3>
<p>Report revised 2016-06-14 fixes alignments in the Invoice section of the report.</p>
<h3>16.2.3 Report PM WorkOrder List</h3>
<p>This release plus the revised Report PM WorkOrder List (RPMWRKORDRLST.rpt) dated 2017-09-12 supports the OrderBy registry (if present) for the function Start Create PM Work Orders (sys-start-scrtepmwo). &#160;This means that the function's checklist and the report will appear in the same order.</p>
<p style="font-weight: bold;">Important Note to Sybase Users:</p>
<p>If the Client Site Equipment's Inspection Date is referenced in the OrderBy statement, its database name must be entered as <span style="font-weight: bold;">c</span>lntsteeqpmntpm.clntsteeqpmntpm_dte_schdld_inspctn <span style="font-weight: bold;">instead of</span> clntsteeqpmntpm_dte_schdld_inspctn to prevent a Sybase error -144 column not found error when the report is run.</p>
<p>Id: sys-start-scrtepmwo</p>
<p>Setting Key: OrderBy<br />
Setting Value: clntste_id,clntsteeqpmntpm.clntsteeqpmntpm_dte_schdld_inspctn,tchncn_id,clntsteeqpmnt_id</p>
<h3>16.2.4 Report Site Service History</h3>
<p>The revised Report Site Service History (RSRVCEHSTRYDTL.rpt) dated 2017-10-04 includes a new range filter, Equipment Type Id. This range allows the report to be filtered to Site Equipment of specific Equipment Type(s),</p>
<h2>16.3 Work Order Viewer</h2>
<p>This release corrects a keyFieldNotInDictionary error which occurred when the user attempted to add a Call Script &#160;for the second (or greater) piece of Equipment listed on the Work Order.</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: bold;">Create PO Button:</span> When this button is clicked, the caret will be positioned in the Vendor Id when the PO is opened to save keystrokes.</p>
<p>The system no longer attempts to calculate the Gross Margin if the Work Order or Job Id is empty. This should result in a performance enhancement when the empty Work Over viewer is accessed.</p>
<p><img src="image/SKIN1_CreateQuote.gif" alt="" style="border: none;" border="0" /> When the new Create Quote button is clicked, the Quote Manager viewer is launched with the Work Order Id and other defaults filled in, with the Add button enabled.</p>
<p>Corrects a spurious 'Receiver is not a boolean' error which occurred if the user immediately clicked the RR Wizard or Import RR button after accessing the record.</p>
<h3>16.3.1 Work Order Technician Tab</h3>
<p>A new tech Status, Over Budget, has been added; it has a corresponding Work Order Escalation Status of Over Budget (Status Category Completed), This new status falls above Completed and below Wait Paperwork in precedence.</p>
<p>When changing from one Subcontractor Tech to another Sub, when the Vendor is updated in the associated PO the AP Terms and Tax Group will also be updated. Only PO's with no child lines will be updated.</p>
<p>This release refines the update of the Purchase Order if one Subcontractor Tech (with a referenced PO) is changed to another. The AP Term in the PO is forced to match the terms from the Vendor record, even if blank (unless overridden by customization). The PO's Sales Tax Group is updated from either the Vendor (by default) or Job record (if the DefaultPOTaxGroupFromJob is set to true in sys-viewer-vprchseordrlst registry).</p>
<p style="margin-left: 8px;">Corrects a display issue in the magnify view of the Technician tab.</p>
<p><img src="image/SKIN1_InsertLine.gif" alt="" style="border: none;" border="0" /> &#160;The WO Tech Index allows multiple lines with the same date but not the same time per technician. The insert/copy functionality has been changed to blank the Time Scheduled on the new Line instead of the Date Scheduled. The message "WARNING: the Time Scheduled cannot be copied" will be displayed.</p>
<p style="font-weight: bold;"><span style="font-weight: bold;">Changed Buttons:</span></p>
<p><img src="image/WOTechFinder.gif" alt="image\WOTechFinder.gif" title="image\WOTechFinder.gif" width="65" height="18" border="0" /> &#160;TechFinder functionality now supports the sys-viewer-vwrkordr registry's CreatePOForSub option: if it is set to Automatic, a PO will automatically be generated when a Subcontractor is assigned. &#160;If the option is set to Prompt, the user will be prompted to confirm that a PO should be created. &#160;If the option is set to Manual (or the registry is absent) a Subcontractor PO will not be generated.</p>
<p><img src="image/createpoforsub.gif" alt="" style="border: none;" border="0" /> When a SubAnywhere subcontractor is added to a Work Order, the PO that is generated for the sub (either automatically or by clicking the Create Sub PO button) will be set to Unreleased to conform to SubAnywhere requirements. To be considered a SubAnywhere tech, the Technician record must: reference a Vendor record; have the Web Access field set to Subcontractor, and have the Remote Device Type set to the new option of SubAnywhere.</p>
<h3>16.3.2 Work Order Quotes Tab</h3>
<p>When a line on the display-only Quotes Tab is double-clicked, the Quote Manager viewer for that Quote will be launched. &#160;In previous versions, the older Quotes viewer was displayed.</p>
<h3>16.3.3 Work Order Invoices Tab</h3>
<p><span style="font-weight: bold;">Changed Field: Balance</span><br />
Corrects a display issue where a discount applied in Cash Receipts appeared in this field. This field now correctly displays only the balance due (if any) on the invoice. &#160;</p>
<p style="mso-list: l0 level1 lfo1; font-weight: bold;">New Field: Discount Taken<br />
<span style="font-weight: normal;">This display field is maintained by the system.</span></p>
<h3>16.3.4 &#160;Work Order ReqResource Tab</h3>
<p><span style="font-weight: bold;">New Field - UOM:</span><br />
Displays the Unit of Measure from the Inventory record.</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: bold;">Vendor Id:</span><br />
In this release, the Vendor always defaults from the Inventory record's Purchasing when a manual line is entered AND the global registry option DefaultRequiredResourceVendorFromInventory=true is enabled. Previously, this defaulting was blocked if DefaultRequiredResourceVendorFromJCHBudgets=true was also set.</p>
<p style="margin-left: 8px;">When an Inventory Item is added, the Job Cost Category defaults from the Inventory Item's Group record. The Cost Category must be of Type Material.</p>
<p style="font-weight: bold;">New Button:</p>
<p><img src="SKIN1_OpenMatReq.bmp" alt="" style="border: none;" border="0" /> When this button is clicked, the Start Material Requisitioning function is launched with the As Of Date field set to today, and the selected Work Order Id entered in its range filter.</p>
<h3>16.3.4a &#160;Picked Processing</h3>
<p>If items are not transferred to the Inventory tab when the record is saved with the 'Picked' flag set, the transaction will be rolled back. If this functionality is being used, it is strongly suggested that the AdjustDefaultDateOrPeriod registry (in sys-viewer-vwrkordr) is set to date to avoid errors during the picked processing.</p>
<h3>16.3.4b WO Required Resources Wizard</h3>
<p>If the same item appears on the ReqResource tab multiple times for different equipment, these lines must be consolidated when the PO is generated. The consolidation messages are now streamlined so that instead of displaying a message each time an time an item requiring consolidation is found, the system now displays the consolidation message only once if needed. A list enumerating the consolidations will then appear. This list may be printed if needed. This information is attached to the PO as a Note.</p>
<p>This release also corrects sporadic problems with Inventory line consolidation.</p>
<h3>16.3.5 Work Order Main Tab</h3>
<p><span style="font-weight: bold;">New Field: Email</span><br />
The Email address from the Site's upper Contacts tab is now displayed below the Site's Phone and Fax numbers.</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: bold;">New Field: Dispatcher Comments</span><br />
This new 3000 character text box may be used to record conversation/activity notes about the Work Order.</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: bold;">Work Order Type Added - Q/A:</span><br />
This Type has been added to identify Work Orders generated by Start Create Quality Assurance Work Orders. See Customer Release Note 16.4 for details.</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: bold;">New Field: Store #:</span><br />
The Site's Store # is now displayed to the right of the Site Id.</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: bold;">Return to Inventory Button:</span><br />
If the Return To Inventory Wizard is canceled, the Inventory Adjustment Journal entry is NOT saved. Previously, an entry with header but no detail information was saved.</p>
<h3>16.3.6 &#160;Work Order Labor Tab</h3>
<p><font style="font-weight: bold;">Labor Tab Header:</font> The Actual Hours: Billable Hours: fields display a running total of hours entered on the Work Order. Negative labor hours are now subtracted from these running totals instead of being added. &#160;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: bold;">PR-to-GL Accruals:</span> In previous releases, accruals were skipped for Standard Cost type Earnings record when an Overhead Jobs was specified. In this release, accruals are correctly posted for Standard Cost Earnings for Jobs that are not Direct.</p>
<p>The <span style="font-weight: bold;">Extended Price</span> has been expanded from decimal(8,2) to decimal (10,2).</p>
<p style="font-weight: bold;">Magnify View New Fields</p>
<p style="margin-left: 48px;"><span style="font-weight: bold;">Start Time: &#160;Stop Time:</span><br />
These fields would typically be completed if this time was originally entered via TechAnywhere. Note that changes made to these fields may impact the actual Hours field.</p>
<p style="margin-left: 8px;"><span style="font-weight: bold;">Payroll Period:</span><br />
Validation now prevents changing the Payroll Period on an existing Labor line from one that has Accrue to GL enabled to one with Accrual to GL disabled and vice versa.</p>
<h3>16.3.7 &#160;Work Order Inventory Tab</h3>
<p>The Extended Price has been expanded from decimal(8,2) to decimal (10,2).</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: bold;">Changed Field - Bill Type Id:</span><br />
If the new markup methodology is in effect this field will be set to Unit Price because the price calculation is the result of an aggregate calculation. If the old markup methodology is in effect this field will be set to the applicable value (margin, markup or multiplier). See Customer Note 8.3 for details.</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: bold;">New Field - UOM:</span><br />
Displays the Unit of Measure from the Inventory record.</p>
<h3>16.3.8 Work Order Other Tab</h3>
<p style="margin-left: 8px;">This release corrects a recent issue where Tax Cost transfers posted to GLH out-of-balance for Use Tax jobs.</p>
<p>The Tax Cost (for Use Tax Jobs) is now computed properly when an Other Rate with a Standard Cost is selected. Previously, the Tax Cost was not computed if the Unit Cost defaulted in rather than being entered by the user.</p>
<p>Other lines for Fixed Fee Billing Items (for Use Tax Jobs) which the user flags as Extra now &#160;have the Use tax factored in when the Revenue is calculated.</p>
<p>Lines entered via the Flat Rate import now correctly evaluate "exceptions" in the Sale Tax Group when setting the Sales Tax Type.</p>
<p>The Extended Price has been expanded from decimal(8,2) to decimal (10,2).</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: bold;">Changed Field - Bill Type Id:</span><br />
If the new markup methodology is in effect this field will be set to Unit Price because the price calculation is the result of an aggregate calculation. If the old markup methodology is in effect this field will be set to the applicable value (margin, markup or multiplier). See Customer Note 8.3 for details.</p>
<h5>16.3.8a &#160;Lines from Site's WO Other Tab</h5>
<p>This release corrects a 'system primitive failed' error when a Work Order created under the following scenario is first edited:</p>
<p style="margin-left: 48px;">Work Order is created in New Call<br />
The Site's WO Other line writes to the WO Other tab<br />
WO Other to GL is enabled in the Accounting Period</p>
<h5>16.3.8b Unit Price Calculations with Canadian PST</h5>
<p><span style="font-weight: bold;">Changed Field: Unit Price</span><br />
This release corrects the calculation of the Unit Price in the specific scenario where the Bill Quantity was edited to a different value than the Actual Quantity for lines where there is a "tax cost" to be included in the basis of calculating the Unit Price. This issue primarily impacts situations such as calculating the Canadian PST as an additional cost on a line to be included in pricing mark-up. When adjusting the Unit Cost to include Tax Cost on the Work Order Other tab, the system now uses the Actual Qty, not the Billable Qty.</p>
<h3>16.3.9 &#160;Work Order COD Child Tab</h3>
<p>The user id is now sent to XCharge for a WO COD Payment single payment where the alias is not known.</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: bold;">New Field: Date Received:</span> (click the Magnify Button to access)<br />
It may be necessary to generate multiple invoices on a single WO that has multiple COD lines from different visits.&#160;In previous releases, this was handled by toggling the 'Do Not Apply' flag. In this release, when invoicing with the revised Service Invoice, the system compares the COD's Date Received with the Bill Thru Date selected to determine if a WO COD line should be included on the invoice. The Cash Receipts Journal entry generated when the invoice is posting will have its Effective Date set to the WO COD Tab's Date Received. If the Date Received does not fall within the current default Accounting Period, the Cash Receipt's Effective Date is adjusted to be either the Start Date or the End Date of the defaulted Accounting Period.&#160;&#160;The Start Date is chosen when the current date is less than the Start Date.&#160;&#160;The End Date is chosen when the current date is greater than the End Date.</p>
<p>If the COD Tab's Date Received is blank, the line will be included on the invoice unless the Do Not Apply flag is set.</p>
<p>The revised Service Invoice Report (serviceinvoicev90b002.rpt) dated 12/17/2014 supports the use of the WO COD tab's Date Received field to determine if a COD Payment should be included on an invoice. If the Invoice's Bill Thru Date equals or exceeds the WO COD tab's Date Received the COD Payment will be applied to the Invoice. &#160;</p>
<h3>16.3.9 &#160;Work Order Revenue Adjustment Tab</h3>
<p>The Adjust Revenue button on the GM tab now skips the special *ACCRUAL* lines for PM Invoicing even if they have not yet been billed.</p>
<p>This release prevents spurious Tab Mismatch errors encountered when additional Revenue Adjustment lines were added to accrual-type PM Work Orders.</p>
<p>This release closes a loophole which allowed the user to delete billed Revenue Adjustments immediately after invoicing a Work Order. The user is also prevented from indirectly deleting billed lines via the Adjust Revenue button on Gross Margin tab.&#160;&#160;</p>
<h3><span style="font-weight: bold;">16.3.10 Work Order Import Costs Wizard</span></h3>
<p>In this release, labor, material and other lines imported into the Work Order (using either the Import Costs button or the Import Costs Wizard) will retain their Job information even when the registry option DefaultJobByEquipmentId is enabled.</p>
<p>Refines the import of requisitioned items when the User's and WO's Branches are not the same.</p>
<p>Corrects an error when selecting the Equipment Id on the Inventory screen.</p>
<h3><span style="font-weight: bold;">16.3.11 Work Order Call Script Tab</span></h3>
<p>The Call Script tab retains the User Id of the person who entered the Call Script when a different user saves the Work Order.</p>
<h3>16.3.12 Create PO Button</h3>
<p>The Purchase Order registry DefaultPOTaxGroupFromJob is also supported when a PO is generated via this button.</p>
<h3>16.3.13 Work Order - Project Manager Filtering</h3>
<p>This release applies the User's PM filtering to the Work Order viewer. The Project Manager is connected to the Work Order via the Work Order's parent Job. &#160;A new list option, Work Orders By Project Manager Id has been added to support this enhancement.</p>
<h3>16.3.14 Work Order Invoicing Tab</h3>
<p><span style="font-weight: bold;">Date Closed:</span><br />
This field is set to today's date when the Work Order's Escalation Status is set to Cancelled: this happens when all Tech lines on are set to 'cancelled'.</p>
<h3><span style="font-weight: bold;">16.3.15 Work Order Gross Margin Tab</span></h3>
<p>This release corrects a display issue where the Gross Margin % value was truncated for values greater than 100%. For &#160;example, if the gross margin% was calculated as GM $/Total Revenue = 558.39 / 493.00 = 113.26% only the 13,26% would display in previous versions.</p>
<p>The Adjust Revenue button now skips the special *ACCRUAL* lines for PM Invoicing even if they have not yet been billed to prevent Tab Mismatches.</p>
<h3>16.3.16 Work Order <span style="font-weight: bold;">Other Info Tab</span></h3>
<p>The Work Order Comments field has been expanded to display the 15 lines of the Site Work Order Comments.</p>
<h3>16.3.17 Work Order Revenues Tab</h3>
<p>This release corrects a 'Runtime error: system primitive failed' which occurred when double clicking on an AP Journal line.</p>
<h3><span style="font-weight: bold;">16.3.18 Work Order Equipment Tab</span></h3>
<p>This release correctly sets the Cycle Code Filter when Equipment is manually added with a Work Code referencing a Cycle Code. This will prevent TechAnywhere sync issues resulting from an incorrectly formatted filter. &#160;</p>
<h2>16.4 Start Create Quality Assurance Work Orders</h2>
<h3>Purpose:</h3>
<p>This new starter function allows users to create new Quality Assurance (Q/A) Work Orders for internal use by "cloning" completed Work Orders.</p>
<h3>Description of Q/A Work Order</h3>
<p>The new Q/A Work Order will include information specified from the input screen as well as fields imported from the Work Order being cloned. The Work Order Type will be set to Q/A. The&#160;Job Id, Job Cost Code Id and Job Billing Item Id will not be cloned.</p>
<p>The following fields will be set when the Q/A Work Order is generated:</p>
<p style="text-decoration: underline;">Work Order Header (Main and Invoicing Tabs):</p>
<p style="margin-left: 8px;">The following fields will be "cloned" from the WO used to create it:</p>
<p style="margin-left: 48px;">Work Order Name - Site Id - Original Caller - Branch Id<br />
Service Manager - Work Order NTE - &#160;Work Performed<br />
Dispatcher - Sales Rep - Service Zone</p>
<p>The Work Code will default from the function's input field.</p>
<p>If the user specified an Escalation Profile when running the function, it will be written to the Q/A Work Order. If the user did not specify the Escalation Profile, it will be "cloned" from the Work Order used to create it.<br />
The Original WO Id will be set to the Work Order used to generate this Q/A Work Order.</p>
<p style="text-decoration: underline;">Equipment Tab:</p>
<p>These fields will be "cloned" from the WO used to create it:</p>
<p style="margin-left: 48px;">Equipment Id - Work Code - Resolution Code - Cause Code<br />
Service Parts Id - &#160;Service Tasks Id<br />
Work Requested - Work Performed</p>
<p style="text-decoration: underline;">Technician Tab:</p>
<p style="text-decoration: none;">These fields will default from the function's input fields:</p>
<p style="margin-left: 48px;">Tech Id - Status - Date Scheduled</p>
<p style="margin-left: 8px;">The Time Scheduled will be set to 8:00, and the Status will be set to the default for the selected Technician. &#160;</p>
<p style="margin-left: 8px; text-decoration: underline;">Log Tab:</p>
<p style="margin-left: 8px;">This tab will be set in the same fashion as the Tech Tab. <span style="font-size: 10.0pt; line-height: 107%; font-family: 'Times New Roman', serif;"><font size="2" style="font-size:10pt;"><span style="mso-tab-count: 1;">&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;</span></font></span></p>

<h2>16.5 Service Agreement Type Viewer</h2>
<p><span style="font-weight: bold;">Changed Field - Service Agreement Type Id</span><br />
Expanded from 10 to 15 Characters.</p>
<p style="font-weight: bold;">New Fields: Service Agreement Type User 1-10<br />
<span style="font-weight: normal;">Optional fields for reporting or other purposes.</span></p>
<h2>16.6 Scheduled Event Viewer</h2>
<p style="font-weight: bold;">Changed Field: Email Message<br />
<span style="font-weight: normal;">This release expands this field to 8000 characters. This will reduce truncation problems where tokens (such as ^workrequestedall^) are used to generate lengthy email notifications and alarms.</span></p>
<h2>16.7 Cause Code Viewer</h2>
<p><span style="font-weight: bold;">New Fields: &#160;Cause Code User 1-5</span><br />
These fields may be used to record additional information required by your company.</p>
<h2>16.8 Technician Viewer</h2>
<p>The following phone extension fields have been expanded to 7 digits in this release:</p>
<p style="margin-left: 48px; font-weight: bold;">Technician Contact 1<br />
Technician Contact 2</p>
<h3>16.8.1 Technician Unavailable Tab</h3>
<p style="font-weight: bold; margin-left: 8px;">New Fields: Start Time: and End Time:<br />
<span style="font-weight: normal;">These fields are currently used in conjunction with custom job scheduling; they are not used by the standard Unavailable functionality in TechFinder and the Dispatch Board.</span></p>
<h3>16.8.2 Technician Web Access Tab</h3>
<p style="font-weight: bold;">Remote Device Type<br />
New Option: SubAnywhere<br />
<span style="font-weight: normal;">If SubAnywhere IS enabled, set the Remote Device Type to SubAnywhere. This field controls whether PO’s are created as Released (None) or Unreleased (SubAnywhere). &#160;If a particular subcontractor should not have access to SubAnywhere, set the Remote Device Type to None. The Web Access field should be set to Subcontractor if you want to auto-generate PO’s for them when a Work Order is created in New Call or Create PM WorkOrders; this is true whether or not SubAnywhere is enabled.</span></p>
<p style="font-weight: normal;">See Customer Note 24.1.1 for additional information on this change.</p>
<h3>16.8.3 Technician Main Tab</h3>
<p style="font-weight: bold;">New Fields:</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: bold;">Vendor Name:<br /></span> If the Vendor field is completed on this subcontractor technician record, the Vendor's Name will be displayed, and the following fields will be completed if applicable.</p>
<p><font style="font-weight: bold;">Insurance Required: Insurance Expired:</font><br />
The insurance required field defaults from the Insurance Required field in the Vendor record. If this field is checked, the system will check the INS tab in the Vendor record to determine if all insurance is still valid. If not, the Insurance Expired field will also be checked.</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: bold;">Payments Blocked:<br /></span> If this display field is checked, the Vendor’s Insurance is flagged as 'Block Payments' and it is currently expired. A 'Payments Blocked' subcontractor may not be selected in New Call or on a Work Order.</p>
<p><font style="font-weight: bold;">Purchases</font> <font style="font-weight: bold;">Blocked:<br /></font>If this display field is checked, the Vendor’s Insurance is flagged as 'Block Purchases' and it is currently expired. In version 9.0, this field is informational only and Purchases Blocked Techs may be selected in New Call and on Work Orders as in previous releases. &#160;</p>
<h2>16.9 Dispatch Board</h2>
<p>Work Order changes are only allowed from the Dispatch Board if the User belongs to a Group with Change permission for View Work Order Work Order Dispatcher. <span style="font-weight: bold;">&#160;</span></p>
<h3>16.9.1 Classic Dispatch Board</h3>
<p><img src="image/SKIN1_Dates-.gif" alt="" style="border: none;" border="0" /> The <span style="font-weight: bold;">Date Range button</span> has been added to the Classic and Day boards. This allows users to switch the Date Range without having to switch to the Powerboard first.</p>
<p style="font-weight: bold;"><span style="font-weight: normal;">This release corrects an overlap issue that made it difficult to click the left arrow to change the Date Scheduled.</span> &#160;<span style="font-weight: normal;">It also corrects a sporadic 'system primitive failed' runtime error when the Tech Id was changed on the Work Order Summary (lower section). This only occurred if the Call Sequence number exceeded the number of rows allowed on the Classic Board or columns on the Day board.</span> &#160;</p>
<h5>Time Chart</h5>
<p>When the Classic/Day Board's Time Chart is displayed, only those Work Orders for the selected Tech will appear.</p>
<p>The length of the bar in the Time Chart is now rounded to the nearest quarter hour so that users can better judge the start and stop times via the bars.</p>
<h5>WO Summary</h5>
<p><span style="font-weight: bold;">New Field: Dispatcher Comments</span><br />
This new 3000 character text box may be used to record conversation/activity notes about the selected Work Order.</p>
<h3>16.9.2 Dispatch Board Sort Options</h3>
<p><span style="font-weight: normal;">A new sort order, Status/WorkOrderId has been added. &#160;This allows all Work Orders of a specific status to be grouped together and in Work Order Id order.</span></p>
<h3>16.9.3 Dispatch Board's Create PO Button</h3>
<p>In previous releases, if the user was editing an existing Purchase Order, and then clicked the Dispatch Board's Create PO button, the system would open a blank PO form, losing any unsaved changes on the PO. In this release, when the Dispatch Board's Create PO button is clicked and an existing PO with unsaved changes is open, a Purchase Order message box will appear:</p>
<p style="margin-left: 48px;">Warning: the changes to the current record have not been saved.<br />
Do you want to return to save your changes?</p>
<p>Clicking Yes returns to the existing PO so that existing changes may be saved. Clicking No opens a new PO form with the Work Order Id completed.</p>
<h3>16.9.4 &#160;Day Board (Classic Board Switched Orientation)</h3>
<p>In previous releases, the Notes button displayed as grayed out when a Work Order was selected. This button now displays correctly, indicating that the user may view/add Notes to the selected Work Order.</p>
<h3>16.9.5 Dispatch Board's Work Order Summary</h3>
<p>The Work Order Summary is accessed by right clicking a line on the Work Order List and selecting Update Work Order. This release corrects a "Key is Missing" when clicking the Save button in the Work Order Summary viewer.</p>
<h3>16.9.6 Power Board</h3>
<p>The length of the bar in the Time Chart is now rounded to the nearest quarter hour so that users can better judge the start and stop times via the bars.</p>
<p>The Notes icon now correctly displays to give the visual queue that there are notes attached to that WO/Site/Job. In previous releases, the Notes button did not always correctly display notes the second time a WO was selected.</p>
<h3>16.9.7 Subcontractor POs</h3>
<p>When changing from one Subcontractor Tech to another Sub on the Work Order or Dispatch Board, when the Vendor is updated in the associated PO the AP Terms and Tax Group will also be updated. Only PO's with no child lines will be updated.</p>
<h3>16.9.7 Power Board Work Order Summary</h3>
<p>The Work Order Summary screen is accessed from the Power Board by right-clicking on a Work Order and selecting Update Work Order. It allows the dispatcher limited edits to specific WO fields. This function was never designed to support the deletion Work Order lines. The Delete Line button has been removed from the side button bar in this release to avoid confusion. This release also corrects a 'key is missing error' when Equipment is added or changed on the Equipment tab.</p>
<h3><span style="font-weight: bold;">16.9.8 Dispatch Board Date Range Tab</span></h3>
<p>Corrects a display issue so that selecting a User Range no longer obscures a pre-defined range.</p>
<h3><span style="font-weight: bold;">16.9.9 Dispatch Board Available Hours Tab</span></h3>
<p>Corrects a spurious 'technician is INACTIVE' message when using the Available Hours tab to assign WO to a tech whose Tech Id exceeds 10 characters.</p>
<h3>16.9.10 Dispatch Board Email Button</h3>
<p>When UseOutlook is enabled via registry, clicking the Email button launches the Outlook form and sets the Email To field with the Tech’s Email Address 2.</p>
<h2>16.10 New Call</h2>
<p>This release corrects a problem writing the Work Requested to the WO when switching between the New Call screens. &#160;</p>
<p>The Site's Service Manager is no longer cleared when changing the Job changes the Client. This corrects a problem which occurred when the sys-newcall registry option ServiceManagerBasedOnSite was set to true. &#160;</p>
<p>A Work Order may be generated with Other lines from the Site's WO Other tab. In this release the Tax Type for warranty jobs (where the job itself has no tax group so it comes from the Site's COP tab) is now set so that it is automatically evaluated correctly as part of Service Compute.</p>
<p>When a Work Order is created, a Record Change Log entry will now be generated with the Date, Time, User Id and the Description "new record created".</p>
<p>The Client Mailing Address now displays below the Client Id: / Client Name: fields when the Client has been determined in New Call and New Call 2. A new v.cus file may be required to see this field.</p>
<p style="margin-left: 8px;">An "Access is Not Allowed" message displays when the Collections button is clicked if the user is not allowed access to the Client record.</p>
<p style="margin-left: 8px;">This release disables the obsolete 'New Job for Every Work Order' functionality experienced by some longtime users.</p>
<p style="margin-left: 8px;">The message saying there are Notes attached only displays if active (non-obsoleted) note(s) are attached to the Site.</p>
<p style="margin-left: 8px;">When a TechAnywhere Weblog is entered, the Work Code / Service Category only default if the Weblog itself specifies a Work Code.</p>
<h3>16.10.1 New Call Create New Client/Site</h3>
<p><span style="font-weight: bold;">Changed Field - Contact 1 Email:</span><br />
The system also writes the Contact 1 Email field to the Client Site Email Address field (clntste_eml) when the Site is created.</p>
<p>Corrects a problem where Work Requested entered in the 'flashlight' (Create New Client/Site) screen overwrote Work Requested subsequently entered in the original New Call screen.</p>
<h3>16.10.2 &#160;New Call 2</h3>
<p style="margin-left: 8px;">This release improves the tab order of the search fields.</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: bold;">New Field: Store #</span><br />
This new field enables searching by the Site's Store # field.</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: bold;">New Field: Original Caller</span><br />
This field lists the person who called in this Work Order. It defaults from the Contact 1 First and Last Name fields in the Client Site record (if completed); if these fields are not completed it will default from the Client Site Contact 2 information. This field may be changed by the user; it will be written to the Work Order's Original Caller field.</p>
<h3>16.10.3 New Call Create New COD</h3>
<p>The Quote Report Id (QuoteDefaults tab) and the GL Entity Id (COP tab) are now defaulted from the Client Site template to the new Client Site created by this function.</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: bold;">New Field: Store #</span><br />
This new field enables the new Site's Store # field to be set.</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: bold;">New Field: Original Caller</span><br />
This field lists the person who called in this Work Order. If completed by the user, it will be written to the Work Order's Original Caller field.</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: bold;">New Field - Sales Tax Group Id:</span><br />
In this release, the User may select the Sales Tax Group to be written to the COP tab of the new Site being added. This new feature should eliminate the need to have separate COD jobs created for each possible Sales Tax Group combination during initial setup. In SAMPro, if the COD Job does not reference a Site (as is the case for COD/MFG Warranty Type Jobs), &#160;Service Compute/Invoicing will use the Site's Sales Tax Group Id instead (from the COP tab) to compute the Sales Tax on the invoice. However, multiple COD jobs are still needed for payroll tax purposes to determine correct State/Local tax codes.</p>
<p style="margin-left: 48px;"><span style="font-weight: bold;">Important:</span> if the COD Job selected has the Sales Tax Group already set, it will not be used to populate this field. Also note that if the ZIP Code Table contains a Sales Tax Group Id for the zip code entered, the system will use it to populate this field; the user may select a different Sales Tax Group if needed.</p>
<p style="margin-left: 48px;"><span style="font-weight: bold;">Multiple COD Jobs by Sales Tax Group:</span><br />
It may not be possible to eliminate these Jobs if they are already setup and being used.&#160;&#160;Listed below are issues to consider: &#160;</p>
<p style="margin-left: 88px;">1. All the existing COD sites will need to be updated to contain a Sales Tax Group on the COP tab.</p>
<p style="margin-left: 88px;">2. All the Site Equipment for these COD sites ‘Default Service’ Job will need to reference either a Taxable or Non-Taxable (exempt) COD Job (with no Sales Tax Group or Site).</p>
<p style="margin-left: 88px;">3. If tracking state tax authorities for payroll purposes on the Financial tab of the Job, then taxable &amp; exempt COD Jobs by state are needed. &#160;The Site Equipment ‘Default Service’ Job will need to reference the correct taxable or exempt COD Job by state.&#160;&#160;If you are tracking local tax authorities for payroll, then it’s doubtful your existing setup would change.</p>
<h3><span style="font-weight: bold;">16.10.4 Equipment Pane</span></h3>
<p style="margin-left: 8px;">The Equipment's Manufacturer has been added between the Warranty End Date and the Model Columns.</p>
<h3><span style="font-weight: bold;">16.10.5 &#160;New Call (FMMS)</span></h3>
<p style="margin-left: 8px;">The NTE amount from the selected Service Request now defaults to the NTE Client field which will populate the corresponding field in&#160;the newly created Work Order.</p>
<p style="margin-left: 8px;">Also fixes an error accessing the FMMSInfo table when the Vendor Value includes an apostrophe (e.g. "Domino's").</p>
<p style="margin-left: 8px;">This release corrects issues in the FacilitySource integration when selecting the web log.</p>
<h3>16.10.6 New Call - SubAnywhere Techs</h3>
<p style="margin-left: 8px;">When a Work Order is created for a SubAnywhere subcontractor tech, the PO that is simultaneously created will be set to Unreleased to conform to SubAnywhere requirements. To be considered a SubAnywhere tech, the Technician record must: reference a Vendor record; have the Web Access field set to Subcontractor, and have the Remote Device Type set to the new option of SubAnywhere.</p>
<h2>16.11 Start Create PM WOs &#160;</h2>
<p>If the TechServiceParts=No registry was enabled in sys-start-scrtepmwo AND both Service Parts and Service Tasks were specified on the Equipment's PM Schedule, the Service Tasks did not write to the WO Equipment Work Requested. This has been corrected so that the Tasks are correctly written to the WO Equipment Work Requested.</p>
<p>This function also generates a PO for Subcontractor Techs. In this release, the Site Equipment being serviced is completed on the PO's Gen line.</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: bold;">I</span>n previous release, this function skipped all Sites flagged as Inactive, and did not consider the Date Closed (which could be in the future). In this release, this validation is refined so that Site with a future Date Closed will not be skipped when this function is run, even if it is flagged as Inactive.</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: bold;">I</span>f WO Inventory lines are generated from the Service Parts list, their Description&#160;field now defaults from the Inventory Item's Name.</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: bold;">Changed Fields: &#160;Start Date: &#160;End Date:</span><br />
In previous releases, the Start and End Date were required to be within the same calendar year. In this release, the dates may cross a calendar year, but the End Date is restricted to a maximum of 1 year from the Start Date. The message 'End Date must not be more than 1 year from Start Date' will be displayed when the user clicks Go if the date range is exceeded.</p>
<p>This version corrects a recent problem in the Checklist screen where un-checking a line NOT associated with a Master Contract resulted in that line being deleted from the Equipment PM Schedule.</p>
<p>The Cancel button as been removed from the Progress Bar since it is ignored by the function.</p>
<h3>16.11.1 Setting the Date and Time Opened</h3>
<p><span style="font-weight: bold;">New Fields: &#160;Date Opened: &#160;Time Opened:</span><br />
These fields will be used to set the Work Order's Date Opened and Time Opened fields. &#160;They default to the current Date and Time, but may be edited by the user if desired. Some reports and standard KPI's utilize the WO Date Opened for date range filtering and analysis of calls "opened". &#160;These reports/analytics would provide a better analysis if the Date opened is set to the date the work is scheduled, or the first day for the month the work is scheduled for. &#160;</p>
<p>In addition, this enhancement allows Escalation events sensitive to "creation" date/time to be handle more accurately, rather than beginning "prematurely".</p>
<h3>16.11.2 &#160;SubAnywhere Techs</h3>
<p style="margin-left: 8px;">When a PM Work Order is generated for a SubAnywhere subcontractor tech, the PO that is simultaneously created will be set to Unreleased to conform to SubAnywhere requirements. To be considered a SubAnywhere tech, the Technician record must: reference a Vendor record; have the Web Access field set to Subcontractor, and have the Remote Device Type set to the new option of SubAnywhere.</p>
<h2>16.12 &#160;Start Message Table Purge</h2>
<p>This release changes/fixes the following in the Start Message Table Purge function:</p>
<p style="margin-left: 48px;">- Remove orphaned LargeObject records as a result of archiving messages<br />
- Change the default action to purge rather than archive if registry 'DisableArchive' is not set<br />
- Include FMMS message statuses of 'sent' and 'sending'<br />
- Include SageQuest message statuses of 'response'</p>
<h2><span style="font-weight: bold;">16.13 TechFinder</span></h2>
<p style="margin-left: 8px;">TechFinder now considers the User's Security Id when generating the list of Techs. &#160;If the User's Security is set, the Technician's Security must either be blank, or be allowed by the User's Security setting. If the User's Security is blank, all applicable Techs will be displayed, regardless of their Security.</p>
<p style="margin-left: 8px;">This release supports TechFinder when localization date settings for Canada are in effect. &#160;</p>
<h2>16.14 Start Create PM Billing / Invoices</h2>
<p>This release corrects a very sporadic issue with this function hanging when a single site was selected.</p>
<p style="margin-left: 8px;">If enabled via registry, the Branch Prefix is once again appended to the Id when a PM Invoice Work Order is created. &#160;</p>
<p style="margin-left: 8px;"><span style="font-weight: bold;">OpenEdge Credit Card Processing</span><br />
XCharge sometimes returns an empty response for certain aliases resulting in an 'out of bounds' error. In this release, when an empty response is received a decline message will instead be generated: "Error Empty response received for Site &lt;site&gt; for amount &lt;amount&gt; with Alias: &lt;alias&gt;". This issue may then be investigated with Xcharge.</p>
<p style="margin-left: 8px;">The Cancel button as been removed from the Progress Bar since it is ignored by the function.</p>
<h3>16.14.1 Inventory Extras</h3>
<p style="margin-left: 8px;">This release corrects an issue which prevented PM Work Order Inventory Extras from being billed. In this release, if the Extra flag is set on an existing WO Inventory line, the AR Invoice Id will not be written to Job History based on the PM Invoice Id being completed in the Work Order. &#160;This will allow these lines to be billed separately on the Preventive Maintenance Work Order apart from the existing PM Invoice. (Note that if the Create PM Work Order registry option Setting Key AssignPMInvoiceIds is set to false the PM Invoice will not be defaulted to Preventive Maintenance Work Orders).</p>
<h2>16.15 Start Work Order Daily Edit</h2>
<p>Work Orders with a Status Category of ''Archived'' are now excluded from this function.</p>
<p>See Customer Note 16.1.3a for a registry to use the standard settings when running this function from the Dispatch Board.</p>
<h3>16.15.1 Range Screen</h3>
<p><span style="font-weight: bold;">Changed Field - Selected Date:</span><br />
The user is now allowed to roll back work orders to before today, but doing so will display a warning:<br />
&#160;&#160;"Warning: Selected Date is before Today all Workorders on list will be set to this date."</p>
<h3>16.15.2 Checklist Screen</h3>
<p style="font-weight: bold;">Checklist Screen: Site City<br />
<span style="font-weight: normal;">The Site City has been added to the right of the Site Name column.</span></p>
<h2>16.16 Start Renew Master Contracts</h2>
<p>The function does not support Master Contracts with multiple inspection lines for the same day and month and do not have the Monthly or Day of the Week Inspection boxes flagged. &#160;In previous releases, attempting to do so resulted in the system locking up with the progress bar displayed.</p>
<p>In this release, if Start Renew Master Contracts encounters a Master Contract with this issue, the processing will be stopped and the following message displayed:</p>
<p style="margin-left: 48px;">ERROR: Master Contract (Master Contract Id) has duplicate dates in inspection lines. Correct this error in this Master Contract or clear its Renewable flag and renew it manually. None of the Master Contract in this run have been updated; if multiple Master Contracts were specified, rerun this function after correcting the problem.</p>
<p>The user must correct this issue as indicated in message in order to proceed.</p>
<h2>16.17 Start Work Order Entry</h2>
<p>The Work Order Labor and Inventory extended price fields were expanded in 9.0. This release makes the corresponding changes to this function to correct FieldLength errors. &#160;If your system was converted to 9.0 BEFORE this release, it will be necessary to trigger a reconversion to correct the errors; contact Support for assistance.</p>
<h2>16.18 <span style="font-weight: bold;">Start Scheduled Event Purge</span></h2>
<p>This function will now purge scheduled events for archived Work Orders.</p>
<h2>16.19 Master Contract</h2>
<h3><span style="font-weight: bold;">16.19.1 &#160;Master Contract List</span></h3>
<p>This release corrects a "selected record not found" error when selecting a Master Contract from a list displaying an Agreement Type Id which exceeded 10 characters.</p>
<h2>16.20 Escalation Management</h2>
<h3>16.20.1 New Statuses: Manager Review and Over Budget</h3>
<p>A new Technician and WO Escalation Status has been added, Manager Review. It follows Invoice Ready in the Escalation hierarchy with a WO Status Category of Completed, as shown below.</p>
<p>The new Over Budget Tech Status has a corresponding Work Order Escalation Status of Over Budget (Status Category Completed), This new status falls above Completed and below Wait Paperwork in precedence.</p>

<h2><span style="font-weight: bold;">16.23 Start Renew Service Contracts</span></h2>
<p>In previous releases, Start Renew Service Contract renewed PM Schedules on inactive pieces of equipment if they were marked OK to Renew.&#160;&#160;In this release, the Active/Inactive status of the Equipment will be considered during the renewal process so that Equipment flagged as Inactive will be skipped even if has PM Schedule lines flagged as Ok To Renew.</p>
<h2>16.24 Scheduled Event Manager</h2>
<p>The system no longer pops up a message when a scheduled report is generated from an escalation profile event.&#160;In previous releases, reports auto-generated from an escalation profile would cause a message to display when the report was added the report queue. This would cause the scheduled events manager to stop running until the message was cleared. This could be controlled by configuring the batch file running scheduled events with the switch -messageBoxSuppress=yes enabled, but this was not the best solution.</p>
<h1>17 TechAnywhere</h1>
<p>A new field, Bar Code Id, has been added to the Equipment record. &#160;In this release, TechAnywhere will post to the Bar Code Id for new Equipment and also in Equipment edits.</p>

<h2>17.3 TechAnywhere Post</h2>
<p>When a Flat Rate is referenced, the price from TechAnywhere is always used. Previously, if the price was adjusted using any other price level than 1, the TechAnywhere price override was ignored.</p>
<p>This version corrects Labor and PO posting issues in recent releases.</p>
<p>When posting Quotes from TechAnywhere, prices for Other and Material items are now successfully posted. This corrects an issue in recent releases where costs but not prices were posted.</p>
<p>This release corrects a sporadic problem where the Equipment Id on the PO's Gen tab was cleared on general items received in TechAnywhere.</p>
<p>This fix applies to customers using the Taylor Universal Work Order functionality. It corrects a 'Key is Missing' error when posting Work Order COD information.</p>
<p>This release corrects a sporadic problem where TechAnywhere combined all outstanding quotes into one message resulting in all scopes being written to all quotes created by the post.</p>
<p style="margin-left: 8px;">PO's will not be updated by the post if no values have changed. This will preclude failed message when the post attempts to update a closed PO.</p>
<p style="margin-left: 8px;">This release supports subfolder logic when a file is archived after a delay; previously, these files were archived in the base archive directory. &#160;</p>
<p>The Unit Cost entered by the Tech Material and Other lines now posts back to SAMPro so that the Quote's costs are correct.</p>
<p>To improve performance, the Post applies a 90 Day cutoff date for documents so that it no longer attempts to archive documents which can likely never be archived. .</p>
<p>The Client Site Security is assigned to new Site Equipment added by TechAnywhere.</p>
<p>This release makes the determination of a TA PO's posting style more accurate.</p>
<p>The Tax Type is now set correctly when Flat Rates are posted from TechAnywhere.</p>
<p>PO's generated in TechAnywhere now have their Company / Security set from the Work Order that the material was purchased for.&#160;</p>
<p>This release corrects a problem in the TechAnywhere Post cause by the override of the Labor Rate by the Job Cost Category.</p>
<p>When posting Quotes from TechAnywhere, the system now updates the Quote Amount and Net Amounts in the database for non-fixed price quotes.</p>
<p>Previously, only the hours and minutes from the start and stop times posted to the labor entry.&#160;This release enhances the post so that the Hours, Minutes and Seconds are posted.</p>
<p>Taxable discounts for Use Tax jobs now have the Tax Type correctly set to Use on the Revenue Adjustment lines generated by the post. The discount totals with taxable and nontaxable portions are divided (if needed) when it posts revenue adjustments.</p>
<p>When Equipment is created via a TechAnywhere TimeSheet, the Equipment Status is now filled in with 'NewFromTA' like it is when it is created from a CompletedWO message.</p>
<p>Very large Status Changes messages are now handled successfully by the TechAnywhere Post.</p>
<p style="margin-left: 8px;">Supports rescheduling of Work Orders from the field. See your TechAnywhere support rep for details.</p>
<p style="margin-left: 8px;">The terminated employee warning is now ignored when posting labor to prevent posting failures.</p>
<p>This release supports TechAnywhere labor posting when the PostLaborByWorkOrder registry is set to true.</p>
<p style="margin-left: 8px;">Corrects a problem in previous releases where, if the first Equipment line on a WO had a blank Equipment Id, TA PO's failed to post.</p>
<p style="margin-left: 8px;">Corrects a Key Is Missing error when a new style TechAnywhere PO is posted.&#160;&#160;</p>
<p style="margin-left: 8px;">The Log Form Id specified by Techs when creating NEW Equipment records now posts to SAMPro.</p>
<p style="margin-left: 8px;">TechAnywhere supports writing to the new field Work Order COD Tab's Effective Date field. The date the Technician touches the payment will be used to complete this new field.</p>
<p>If the Equipment is not specified on the Equipment tab, the post will add an Equipment line, and then post the Other Rate lines in the message.</p>
<p>TechAnywhere Reimbursable Expenses (Other) and Breaks (TimeLog) now store the correct security ID.</p>
<h3>17.3.1 TechAnywhere PO Receipt Post</h3>
<p>V9.0.572.052 corrects a problem in V9.0.572.049 where the TechAnywhere post did not update the Job Quantity Ordered and Job Quantity Received on the PO from TechAnywhere.</p>
<p>In previous releases, the TechAnywhere PO Receipt Post could select the incorrect Accounting Period/Effective Date. Typically, this would occur around the time of an accounting period changeover (beginning of the month) due to the Information warning/error "EffectiveDateNotInPeriodRange" causing the TechAnywhere Event Manager to stop running until cleared. For example, if the default accounting period was still December, posting with a &#160;January 1st date could generate Information warning/error "EffectiveDateNotInPeriodRange" causing the TechAnywhere Event Manager to stop running until cleared.</p>
<p>In this release, the PO Receipt Post now adjusts the Accounting Period match the Effective Date if possible. &#160;The following registry entry may be used to override the default behavior and instead set the effective date to fall within the Default Accounting Period to the default Effective Date. In most cases, the default functionality (period) is preferred. <span style="font-weight: bold;">This entry (and the new default behavior) only impacts the TechAnywhere Receipt Post, not manual entries.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: bold;">Id:</span> sys-viewer-vinvntryrcpt</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: bold;">Setting Key:</span> AdjustDefaultDateOrPeriod &#160;<span style="font-weight: bold;">Setting Value:</span> period or date &#160;(default is period)</p>
<p><span style="text-decoration: underline;"><u>When period is specified:</u></span><br />
The Accounting Period table is queried for eligible Accounting Periods.&#160;&#160;To qualify, the period must be Active and its date range must include the defaulted Effective Date.&#160;&#160;When multiple periods are eligible, the one with the smallest Period Id is chosen to become the new Accounting Period for the current transaction.&#160;&#160;If no eligible period is found, nothing is changed.</p>
<p><span style="text-decoration: underline;"><u>When date specified:.</u></span><br />
The Effective Date is adjusted to be either the Start Date or the End Date of the defaulted Accounting Period.&#160;&#160;The Start Date is chosen when the current date is less than the Start Date.&#160;&#160;The End Date is chosen when the current date is greater than the End Date.<br />
<br />
In the absence of the new setting, it uses the 'adjust period' behavior described above as default.</p>
<h2>17.4 &#160;TechAnywhere Rescheduling Option</h2>
<p style="margin-left: 8px;">An option added to TechAnywhere 3.6.054.013 allows a certain work order status to trigger the ability for a technician to reschedule the work order. Your TechAnywhere Support Rep will need to enable this option for you. Once it has been enabled, your Techs will have the option to reschedule the work order for:</p>
<p style="margin-left: 8px;">1) New Schedule Date&#160;<br />
2) New Schedule Time<br />
3) Different Technician (separate option)<br />
4) New Status (separate option)<br />
<br />
The details from the technician's selections will send to SAMPro in a Message where they will be processed by the TechAnywhere Event Manager. The end result will be a new line on the work order technician tab with the details the technician selected. If an existing (duplicate) line happens to already exist with the same Technician/Schedule Date/Schedule Time, the line will be updated with the new status.</p>
<h2>17.5 TechAnywhere Scheduled Event Manager</h2>
<p style="margin-left: 8px;">Enhancements to the code eliminate false positive TimeOutAlarm events when a large backog is being processed.</p>
<h2><span style="font-weight: bold;">17.6 TechAnywhere New Call</span></h2>
<p style="margin-left: 8px;">When a Work Order is created in TechAnywhere, its Client and Sub NTE fields now default from the Site Equipment record. If these fields are not set in the Equipment record, they will default from the Site record. These fields were not previously set when a Work Order was created in TechAnywhere.</p>
<h2>17.7 TechAnywhere <span style="font-weight: bold;">Timesheet</span></h2>
<p style="margin-left: 8px;">When Equipment is created, the Equipment Name now defaults to Pending instead of the Equipment Id to correct an issue with Custom Fields. If Custom Field values are specified for the Equipment Name, <span style="font-weight: bold;">Pending</span> <span style="text-decoration: underline;"><u>must</u></span> be one of the allowable options.</p>
<h2>17.8 TechAnywhere Quote Enhancements</h2>
<p>In conjunction with the configured TechAnywhere options available in 4.1.059.001, this release now supports the ability to post quote discounts (revenue adjustment) and an option to email a recipient with a SAMPro generated scheduled quote report (RQTEFRM).</p>
<p>The revenue adjustment utilizes the following existing registry entry (typically used for work order discounts) to define the cost category used to record the revenue adjustment on the quote.</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: bold;">Id:</span> sys-techanywhere<br style="color: #000000; font-family: Verdana, 'Helvetica Neue', Helvetica, Arial, sans-serif; font-size: 14px; font-style: normal; font-variant-ligatures: normal; font-variant-caps: normal; font-weight: normal; letter-spacing: normal; orphans: 2; text-align: start; text-indent: 0px; text-transform: none; white-space: normal; widows: 2; word-spacing: 0px; -webkit-text-stroke-width: 0px; text-decoration-style: initial; text-decoration-color: initial;" />
<span style="font-weight: bold;">Setting Key:</span> DiscountCostCategory &#160;<span style="font-weight: bold;">Setting Value:</span> <span style="font-style: italic;"><i>CostCategoryId of discount</i></span></p>
<p>The GL for the discount will be pulled from that Cost Category.</p>
<p>The quote report is triggered by the technician's actions to request a quote report to be emailed to the customer. The FROM email address is pulled from the SAMPro registry for sys-email DefaultEmailSender, and the TO email address is specified by the technician. A scheduled report event will be created where the Scheduled Report Manager SAMPro Service will execute the event on the next tick to email the report to the email recipients.</p>
<p>Contact your TechAnywhere support rep to have the necessary configurations/scheduled events implemented to support this new functionality.</p>
<h3>17.9 &#160;Require a PCR Table for New Equipment</h3>
<p style="font-weight: bold;">Client Site Service Tab</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: bold;">New Field - PCR Table Id:</span><br />
This field is used by TechAnywhere to indicate that Equipment linked to this Site requires a PCR Table. If it is completed, TechAnywhere will force technicians to pick a PCR table ID whenever adding new equipment for a Site with this field completed.</p>
<p>This field also provides the new default value for new Equipment created for this Site in SAMPro.</p>
<h1>18 &#160;Fleetmatics (was Sagequest)</h1>
<p>This release corrects a formatting issue which prevented GPS stops from getting to Fleetmatics.</p>
<p>Revised handling of the cancellation of a schedule date, and direction request to be compatible with the Fleetmatics work order format.</p>
<p>All Work Order Technician lines are now sent to Fleetmatics. Additionally, the schedule date has now been appended to the end of the WorkOrderID sent to Fleetmatics.</p>
<p>The estimated hours is now converted to seconds when a message is sent to Fleetmatics as a result of a drag and drop operation on the Classic Board. In addition, the system no longer sends messages to Fleetmatics if the old and new Techs are the same during a drag and drop.</p>
<p>This release corrects a problem where the Estimated Hours sent to Fleetmatics/SageQuest was being truncated after 9,999 seconds (2hr 47min).</p>
<h2>18.1 Registry</h2>
<h3>18.1.1 Changed Registry - Prior Dates Allowed by Default</h3>
<p><span style="font-weight: bold;">Id:</span> sys-ffv-global-settings</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: bold;">Setting Key:</span> &#160;AllowSageQuestToUsePriorDates &#160;<span style="font-weight: bold;">Setting Value:</span> true (now defaults true)</p>
<p>The above registry option was implemented to allow SAMPro to send updates to Fleetmatics (Sage Quest) with the scheduled date being in the past. This registry setting was a success, and is now being used for every new install. In this release, the default value of this setting has been changed to true. By default, SAMPro will now send work order updates to Fleetmatics regardless of the schedule date. Clients will not have to roll the dispatch board over to keep the schedule date current just to have their work orders show up and update the Fleetmatics (SageQuest) map.</p>
<h2>18.2 Start Get Valid Drivers from Fleetmatics (was Sage Quest)</h2>
<p>Start Get Valid Drivers From Sage Quest has been changed to Start Get Valid Drivers From Fleetmatics. &#160;It may be necessary to run the Start Function List Update to see this change.</p>
<p>When running this starter function, it will no longer report how many drivers it found. This supports configuring this function as a scheduled process event without interrupting the Scheduled Event Manager with a popup.</p>
<p>This release also fixes the "Runtime error: "asArrayOfSubstringsSeparatedBy:" not understood" if running this function when Fleetmatics Integration software is not running at the time.</p>
<h2>18.3 Time+Distance Button</h2>
<p>Corrects a sporadic problem with incorrect responses when clicking the Work Order's Time+Distance button.</p>
<h2>18.4 Dispatch Board</h2>
<p style="margin-left: 8px;"><img src="SKIN1_SageQuest.bmp" alt="" style="border: none;" border="0" /> &#160;Replaces the old SageQuest button on the Dispatch Board.</p>
<h1>19 Shop Orders</h1>
<h2>19.1 Shop Order Registry</h2>
<h2>19.2 Shop Order Viewer</h2>
<h3>19.2.1 Cancel Shop Order</h3>
<p style="font-weight: bold;">New Button:</p>
<p style="font-weight: bold;"><img src="CancelShopOrder.bmp" alt="" style="border: none;" border="0" /></p>
<p>This button allows a Shop Order to be canceled. This functionality is only allowed if the Transfers Printed and Transfers Recorded boxes are NOT checked.</p>
<p>When it is clicked, the quantities allocated or back ordered will be zeroed, and the Date Closed will be set to today. If the Work Order Id is set, the Requisitioned flag and Shop Order Id on the Work Order's ReqResources tab will be cleared. This provided a way of undoing the Start Materials Requisitioning function which generated the Shop Order.</p>
<h3><span style="font-weight: bold;">19.2.2 Shop Order Record Transfer Ticket</span></h3>
<p>The Unit Cost from the stocking location is now written to the staging location by this function. This cost will be used by the Tech Material Pickup Transfer function, resulting in a more accurate cost when applied to the Work Order.</p>
<h1>20 &#160;Requisitioning</h1>
<p>See Shop Orders (above) for related functionality.</p>
<h1>21 Service Channel</h1>
<p style="margin-left: 8px;">This release corrects issues experienced by some Canadian users uploading invoices. The Invoice Date is now sent in US format even for Canadian users for the I12 and I14 ServiceChannel Invoice Formats.</p>
<p style="margin-left: 8px;">This release supports Work Order IDs with alphabetic characters (prepended with a Branch Id).</p>
<p style="margin-left: 8px;">Refines handling of invalid responses from ServiceChannel to prevent HTTPServer crashes.</p>
<p style="margin-left: 8px;">Incorrectly configured ServiceChannel responses now place a diagnostic message in the offending message record. The invalid response will otherwise be ignored so that posting is not interrupted.</p>
<p style="margin-left: 8px;">SAMPro is prohibited from updating a Work Order's status in response to an inbound IVR status change message for ‘Cancelled’ and ‘Billed’ Work Orders. See Customer Note 21.2.8 for details / a registry to adjust this behavior. &#160;</p>
<p style="margin-left: 8px;">The COMPL_DATETIME will be sent to ServiceChannel for status change messages beginning with 'COMPLETED'. COMPL_DATETIME comes the Tech Tab's scheduled date and time.</p>
<p>The Work Order's NTE is now set correctly when it is created from a ServiceChannel Service Request (WebLog) processed in New Call.</p>
<p>This release modifies the computation of DATETIME so that it can not be earlier than SCHED_DATETIME to conform with recent ServiceChannel validations.</p>
<p style="margin-left: 8px;">The Work Order's Work Performed is sent to ServiceChannel whenever a Status update is sent.</p>
<p style="margin-left: 8px;">In this release, we follow up by sending ServiceChannel a Status Change message setting the ServiceChannel status to DISPATCH_CONFIRMED.&#160;</p>
<p style="margin-left: 8px;">Traps error caused by ill-formed Service Channel response messages.</p>
<p style="margin-left: 8px;">Corrects a 'key is missing' runtime error when changing status for ServiceChannel mutual client PM's.</p>
<p style="margin-left: 8px;">Includes PIN number when a PM Work Order is inserted in the FMMSInfo table.</p>
<p style="margin-left: 8px;">Service Channel is updated when a PM WO is created.</p>
<p style="margin-left: 8px;">Now defaults PROBLEM to 'Unknown' if it is empty; ServiceChannel ignores new work orders from SAMPro if the PROBLEM field is empty.</p>
<p style="margin-left: 8px;">Corrects an "IndexOf" error when selecting a weblog in New Call.</p>
<p style="margin-left: 12px;">If NewWOToServiceChannelEnabled is set to True and SAMPro's Start Create PM WorkOrders is also used, it creates duplicate PM's. Contact Support for a registry entry to resolve this condition.</p>
<p style="margin-left: 12px;">The type comes from the callNode's attributes instead of a subNode.</p>
<p style="margin-left: 12px;">Adds SCHED_DATETIME to outbound XML for new WO's (Service Channel requirement).</p>
<p style="margin-left: 12px;">Allows WOUPDATES to post to Work Orders originating in SAMPro.</p>
<p style="margin-left: 12px;">This release corrects an amperand (&amp;) character issue when parsing requests.</p>
<p style="margin-left: 12px;">Improved handling of inbound WorkOrder Update dispatches.</p>
<h3>21.0 Check In/Out Problem: TR_NUM vs WO_NUM</h3>
<p>This release addresses a situation where ServiceChannel sends SAMPro a CHECK IN (or CHECK OUT) message in which the TR_NUM points to an FMMSInfo record for a Work Order different from that indicated by the CHECK message's WO_NUM value. In this release, if the CHECK message contains conflicting TR_NUM and WO_NUM values:</p>
<p style="margin-left: 48px;">An entry will be made in the FMMS log file</p>
<p style="margin-left: 48px;">But a Work Order will not be updated because since we do not know which one is correct</p>
<h2>21.1 FMMS Info Table</h2>
<p>Corrects the SQL error: Incorrect syntax near '.' when trying to create RN index on FMMSInfo table.</p>
<h2>21.2 Registries</h2>
<h3>21.2.1 Use ServiceChannel IVR Service for WOs Originating in SAMPro</h3>
<p>This enhancement extends SAMPro’s ServiceChannel Data Bridge to provide for the use of the ServiceChannel IVR service for Work Orders not originating as &#160;ServiceChannel New Service Requests. &#160;A registry (see below) is required to enable this functionality.</p>
<p>When a Work Order is created in SAM Pro via New Call, Create PM Work Order, Create PM Billing, or Create Rental Billing, a <span style="text-indent: -.25in; mso-list: l0 level1 lfo1;">New Work Order XML message (as per ServiceChannel specs) for transmission to ServiceChannel. In the New Call case, however, this process will be omitted if the Work Order was created as the result of the pulling of a ServiceChannel New Service Request from SAMPro’s weblog.</span></p>
<p><span style="text-indent: -.25in; mso-list: l0 level1 lfo1;">The queueing of the New Work Order XML will take place regardless of whether the Client is or is not a “Mutual” Authority/ServiceChannel client. The contents of the New Work Order XML message will be derived from the contents of the SAMPro Work Order and the appropriate entries in the following Registry.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: bold;">Registry Id:</span> sys-FMMS-Vendor-ServiceChannel</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: bold;">Setting Key:</span> NewWOToServiceChannelEnabled &#160;<span style="font-weight: bold;">Setting Value:</span> True</p>
<p><span style="text-indent: -.25in; mso-list: l1 level1 lfo2;">This registry option is required to enable this feature. Set its value to ‘Yes’ or ‘True’ to turn this feature on. Actually, any value beginning with ‘Y’, ‘y’, ‘T’, or ‘t’ will enable this feature.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: bold;">Setting Key:</span> NewWOToServiceChannelDefaults</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: bold;">Setting Value:</span> LOC:multi, SUB:#fromSC, PRIORITY:NORMAL, PRICE:0.00, NTE:0.00, STATUS:OPEN, CURRENCY:USD, TRADE:HVAC, OPERATOR:namefromSC, CATEGORY:Repair</p>
<p style="mso-list: l1 level1 lfo2; margin-left: 12px;">This registry sets the default values of certain attributes for the generated New Work Order. Note that these all appear on one registry line. The format of the line is a collection of comma separated key/Value pairs with the keys separated from the values by a colon.</p>
<p style="margin-left: 12px;">Check with ServiceChannel for the correct values for the <b style="mso-bidi-font-weight: normal;">LOC</b>, <b style="mso-bidi-font-weight: normal;">SUB</b>, <b style="mso-bidi-font-weight: normal;">TRADE</b>, <b style="mso-bidi-font-weight: normal;">OPERATOR</b>, and <b style="mso-bidi-font-weight: normal;">CATEGORY</b> keys as these may vary from installation to installation.</p>
<h3><span style="text-indent: -.25in;">21.2.2 Registry to Map Work Codes and Equipment Id's</span></h3>
<p><span style="text-indent: -.25in; mso-list: l1 level1 lfo2; mso-bidi-font-family: 'Courier New';">N</span>ew registries support setting the Work Code based on the Service Channel Priority, and the Equipment based on the Trade Code.</p>
<p style="font-weight: bold;">Map Service Channel Priority Codes to SAMPro Work Codes</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: bold;">Setting Key:</span> PriorityToWorkCodeMappings &#160;&#160;<span style="font-weight: bold;">Setting Value:</span> <span style="font-style: italic;"><i>PriorityCode:WorkCodeId</i></span></p>
<p>When enabled, this registry automatically sets the Work Code Id to a value derived from the Service Request's PRIORITY attribute.</p>
<p>This option specifies how the Service Channel Priority Codes map to the SAMPro Work Code Id's when a Work Order is created from a Service Channel . It supports multiple lines so that all ServiceChannel Priority Codes may be properly mapped.</p>
<p style="margin-left: 48px;"><span style="text-decoration: underline;"><u>Example:</u></span> The following option maps the ServiceChannel 'Emergency' Priority Code to the SAMPro Work Code Id 'Safety'. &#160;</p>
<p style="margin-left: 48px;">Setting Key: PriorityToWorkCodeMappings: Setting Value: Emergency:Safety</p>
<p style="margin-left: 8px; font-weight: bold;">Map ServiceChannel Trade Codes to SAMPro Equipment Id's</p>
<p style="margin-left: 8px;">When enabled, this registry will automatically select the Client Site Equipment based on the contents of the Service Request's TRADE attribute. It supports multiple lines so that all ServiceChannel Trades may be properly mapped.</p>
<p style="margin-left: 8px;"><span style="font-weight: bold;">Setting Key:</span> TradeToEquipmentMappings &#160;<span style="font-weight: bold;">Setting Value:</span> TradeCode:EquipmentId</p>
<h3>21.2.3 &#160;Registry to Exclude ServiceChannel's Scheduled Date and Time</h3>
<p style="font-weight: bold;">Registry Id: <span style="font-weight: normal;">sys-FMMS-Vendor-ServiceChannel</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: bold;">Setting Key:</span> IncludeScheduledDateInNewWorkOrder &#160;&#160;<span style="font-weight: bold;">Setting Value:</span> No &#160;(default Yes)</p>
<p>When New Call accepts a new Service Request via the weblog, the scheduled and time will be omitted if this option is set to 'No'.</p>
<h3>21.2.4 Registry To Copy the ServiceChannel SCHED_DATETIME to the Work Orders' Date and Time Must Complete fields.&#160;</h3>
<p><font style="font-weight: bold;">Id: <span style="font-weight: normal;">sys-fmms-vendor-ServiceChannel</span></font></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: bold;">Setting Key:</span> <span style="font-size: 14px;">IncludeMustCompleteDateInNewWorkOrder &#160;</span><span style="font-weight: bold;">Setting Value:</span> Y</p>
<p>When this registry is enabled, when a Work Order is generated from Service Channel, the ServiceChannel SCHED_DATETIME will be copied to the Work Orders' Date and Time Must Complete fields.&#160;</p>
<h3>21.2.5 Registry To Upload Equipment Work Performed Notes on Status Change</h3>
<p style="margin-left: 8px;"><font style="font-weight: bold;">Id: <span style="font-weight: normal;">sys-fmms-vendor-ServiceChannel</span></font></p>
<p style="margin-left: 8px;"><span style="font-weight: bold;">Setting Key:</span> UploadEquipmentWorkPerformedNotes</p>
<p style="margin-left: 8px;"><span style="font-weight: bold;">Setting Value:</span> Y</p>
<p style="margin-left: 8px;">Note that values of Y, y, T, or t enable this mod; the default is that this mod is not enabled. When this option is enabled, Work Order's Work Performed is now sent as Notes to ServiceChannel whenever a Status update is sent.</p>
<p style="margin-left: 48px;">A Work Order Note is sent to ServiceChannel for each Equipment line in the Work Order.</p>
<p style="margin-left: 48px;">The Note includes the contents of the Work Order Equipment Work Performed field.</p>
<p style="margin-left: 48px;">Each note is prefixed with the Equipment Id, Manufacturer, Model, and Serial Number.</p>
<p style="margin-left: 8px;">If this option is not enabled, the Work Performed will be included in a &lt;RESOL&gt; sub-element of the &lt;CALL&gt; element when a status change is sent.</p>
<h5>21.2.5a Registry to Disable Uploading Equipment Work Performed by Equipment Id</h5>
<p>The previous registry enables a feature that sends a Work Order Note to ServiceChannel for each equipment line on a work order. This registry allows the upload feature to be disabled for specified Equipment Ids. This new registry option may be used to refine which Equipment Id's have their Work Performed uploaded to ServiceChannel. &#160;The value of this key is a comma separated list of Equipment Ids to be excluded from the Note sending operation.</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: bold;">Id:</span> sys-fmms-vendor-ServiceChannel</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: bold;">Setting Key:</span> UploadEquipmentWorkPerformedNotesExceptEquipment<br />
<span style="font-weight: bold;">Setting Value:</span> <span style="font-style: italic;"><i>Id1,Id2,..</i></span>.</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: bold;">Setting Key:</span> UploadEquipmentWorkPerformedNotes &#160;<br />
<span style="font-weight: bold;">Setting Value:</span> Y &#160;&#160;(note that this setting is also required)</p>
<p>The following example would prevent the sending of Work Order Notes for Client Site Equipment Id 'RTU2', but allow that for all other Equipment Id's to be sent.</p>
<p style="margin-left: 48px;"><span style="font-weight: bold;">Setting Key:</span> UploadEquipmentWorkPerformedNotesExceptEquipment &#160;</p>
<p style="margin-left: 48px;"><span style="font-weight: bold;">Setting Value:</span> RTU2</p>
<h3>21.2.6 Registry to Disable Sending ETA Updates to ServiceChannel / FacilitySource / Corrigo</h3>
<p>This registry disables sending ETA changes to ServiceChannel when a Sampro Work Order's ETA changes.</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: bold;">Id:</span> sys-fmms-vendor-ServiceChannel &#160;/ sys-fmms-vendor-FacilitySource / sys-fmms-vendor-Corrigo</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: bold;">Setting Key:</span> UploadWorkorderETAChanges &#160;<span style="font-weight: bold;">Setting Value:</span> No &#160;&#160;(default is Yes)</p>
<p>Note this setting is applicable to all FMMS Subsystems (e.g. Corrigo, FacilitySource). Any value beginning with 'Y', 'y', 'T', or 't' is equivalent to 'Yes' and any other value is equivalent to 'No'. The absence of the Registry entry is equivalent to a 'Yes' value. So there will be no change in functionality if the Registry entry is not found.</p>
<h3>21.2.7 Registry to Disable Updating SAMPro Work Order Status from Service Channel IVR Messages</h3>
<p>This registry may be used to disable the updating a Sampro Work Order's status based on IVR Check-In and Check-Out messages received from ServiceChannel.</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: bold;">Id:</span> &#160;sys-fmms-vendor-ServiceChannel</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: bold;">Setting Key:</span> &#160;PostIncomingStatusUpdates &#160;&#160;<span style="font-weight: bold;">Setting Value:</span> &#160;No &#160;(default is Yes)</p>
<p>Any value beginning with 'Y', 'y', 'T', or 't' is equivalent to 'Yes' and any other value is equivalent to 'No'. The absence of the Registry entry is equivalent to a 'Yes' value. So there will be no change in functionality if the Registry entry is not found.</p>
<h3>21.2.8 Registry to Define Statuses Exempt from Inbound IVR Status Change Message</h3>
<p>ServiceChannel provides an IVR facility that allows techs to phone into them with a change to a Workorder's status. This change is then forwarded to SAMPro for posting to the SAMPro Workorder. Sometimes it becomes necessary (for ServiceChannel internal reasons) for a tech to make such a IVR entry for a Workorder that has a 'finished' status (e.g. 'billed') within SAMPro. In this release, we prohibit SAMPro from updating a Workorder's status in response to such an inbound IVR status change message for ‘Cancelled’ and ‘Billed’ Work Orders. Note that the Work Order’s current status is derived from the wrkordrlgtype_id on the first line of the Workorder’s Technicians tab. &#160;</p>
<p>This functionality may adjusted via registry.</p>
<p><font style="font-weight: bold;">Id: <span style="font-weight: normal;">sys-fmms-vendor-ServiceChannel</span></font></p>
<p><font style="font-weight: bold;"><span style="font-weight: bold;">Setting Key:</span></font> StatusUpdateIsProhibitedForStatusCodes &#160;<span style="font-weight: bold;">Setting Value:</span> listofstatuscodes</p>
<p>The Setting Value is a list of status codes separated commas. The codes ‘Cancelled’ and ‘Billed’ are always automatically added to the list. If no entry is found, the list will consist solely of these two entries.</p>
<h3>21.2.9 Check-In and Check-Out Messages to ServiceChannel with Check Element</h3>
<p>When SAMPro detects certain Status changes to a Work Order, it sends ServiceChannel a CALL XML message that includes TR_NUM and the new ServiceChannel STATUS code. When entering certain Status values, ServiceChannel would like us to include a CHECK element within the CALL XML. The CHECK element &#160;includes a TYPE code which corresponds to the new Status Code.</p>
<h5>Identify ‘CHECK TYPE’ Values Corresponding to ServiceChannel Work Order Status Codes.</h5>
<p><span style="font-weight: bold;">Registry Id:</span> sys-FMMS-Vendor-ServiceChannel</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: bold;">Setting Key:</span> CheckTypeForServiceChannelStatus</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: bold;">Setting Value:</span> ServiceChannelStatusCode:CorrespondingCHECKTypeCode</p>
<p style="margin-left: 48px;">1. There may be multiple Registry lines with the ‘CheckTypeForServiceChannelStatus’ key.</p>
<p style="margin-left: 48px;">2. Each line may consist of multiple mappings with individual mappings separated by a ‘,’ character.</p>
<p style="margin-left: 48px;">3. The Valid CHECK Type Codes are: IN, OUT, DISP, and CLOSE</p>
<p style="margin-left: 88px; text-decoration: underline;">Example:</p>
<p style="margin-left: 88px;">Setting Key: CheckTypeForServiceChannelStatus<br />
Setting Value: ON_SITE:IN, COMPLETED:OUT</p>
<p style="margin-left: 48px;">4. If a mapping is not found (or evaluates to ‘N/A’), no CHECK element will be included in the CALL XML.</p>
<p style="margin-left: 48px;">5. There being several ServiceChannel Status Codes beginning with ‘COMPLETED’ , a special ‘short cut’ is available for those Status Codes: If no mapping is found (or if an ‘N/A’ mapping is found) &#160;for a Status Code and the Status Code begins with ‘COMPLETED’, Sampro will try to identify and use a mapping for the ‘COMPLETED’ status code.</p>
<h5>Check In and Check Out Sequencing via the CHECK element’s ID property.</h5>
<p>Check elements include an ‘ID’ attribute that ServiceChannel uses to internally sequence Check Ins and Check Outs. The restrictions are:</p>
<p>1. Each Check In process should be identified by an ID attribute value greater in value than that used in any prior Check In processes.</p>
<p>2. Each Check Out process should be identified by an ID attribute that matches that used in the corresponding Check In process.</p>
<p>In order to implement this sequencing, Sampro must somewhere retain the appropriate Check Sequencing information. This has been implemented as follows:</p>
<p>1. Sequencing information will be retained on one of the Work Order’s User Fields.</p>
<p>2. The User Field to be used will be identified in the following registry entry by the line having the key ‘. The value of this key should be a number between 1 and 5 inclusive.</p>
<p style="margin-left: 48px;"><span style="font-weight: bold;">Registry Id:</span> sys-FMMS-Vendor-ServiceChannel</p>
<p style="margin-left: 48px;"><span style="font-weight: bold;">Setting Key:</span> WOUserFieldNumberForCheckInCheckOut</p>
<p style="margin-left: 48px;"><span style="font-weight: bold;">Setting Value:</span> <span style="font-style: italic;"><i>a number between 1 and 5 inclusive.</i></span></p>
<p>3. The chosen User Field in the Work Order should be customized to ‘SC In/Out Count:’.</p>
<p>4. If no ‘WOUserFieldNumberForCheckInCheckOut’ key is found, the value of the next rn will be used for the ID attribute. This will not result in proper sequencing.</p>
<p>5. The format of the In/Out Count field will be of the form ‘inCount/OutCount’.</p>
<p>Example: ‘2/1’ meaning there have been 2 CHECK INs but only 1 CHECK Out.</p>
<p>6. A blank value of the in/Out Count Field will be treated as ’0/0’ so there is no need to initialize this field.</p>
<p>7. Whenever SAMPro sends a CHECK IN, it will increment the Work Order’s inCount; whenever Sampro sends a CHECK OUT, it will increment the Work Order’s outCount.</p>
<p>8. Whenever SAMPro sends either a CHECK IN or a CHECK OUT, it will use the value of the Work Order’s inCount for the ID value, ignoring the outCount. Thus a CHECK IN can have multiple CHECK OUTs. Note that because of this, the outCount is actually irrelevant in this processing and is maintained only for informational purposes.</p>
<p style="margin-left: 48px;"><span style="font-weight: bold;">Caution:</span><br />
Note that this feature should only be used for customers not using ServiceChannel’s IVR check-in/check-out system. It is not clear at this time what will happen if, for example, a Check-Out is sent to ServiceChannel as a response to SAMPro processing a Check-Out message sent by ServiceChannel itself.</p>
<h3>21.2.10 &#160;Registry to Derive Scheduled Date / Time of Accepted Request Message from Original ServiceChannel Request</h3>
<p>When New Call creates a new Workorder based on a &#160;Service Request from ServiceChannel (via the Weblog), it must send ServiceChannel a message that the Service Request has been accepted. This message includes a Scheduled Date and a Scheduled Time.</p>
<p>Normally the Scheduled Date and Scheduled Time are derived from the Workorder being created. The following registry may be implemented to derive the Scheduled Date and Scheduled Time are from data in the original Service Request that was sent by ServiceChannel.&#160;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: bold;">Id:</span> sys-fmms-vendor-servicechannel</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: bold;">Setting Key:</span> SchedDateTimeSourceWhenAcceptingWO</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: bold;">Setting Value:</span> ServiceRequest or WorkOrder (default)</p>
<p>If the key is missing or the value is other than 'ServiceRequest' (case insensitive), a value of 'WorkOrder' will be assumed.</p>
<p>If the Setting Value is 'ServiceRequest', then the Scheduled Date and Scheduled Time will be taken from the original Service Request issued by ServiceChannel. If the value is 'WorkOrder', the Scheduled Date and Scheduled Time will be taken from the Workorder being created.</p>
<h3>21.2.11 Map SAMPro Log Status to ServiceChannel by Client Id</h3>
<p>This release adds the flexibility to map SAMPro log status’ to Service Channel log status’ based on registry set values keyed by Client Id (derived from the Job in the WO header).</p>
<p>Normally, SAMPro Workorder status codes are mapped to ServiceChannel status codes via the ‘StatusMappings’ lines found in the SAMPro ServiceChannel Registry entry; they will be used for all Service Channel Clients. However, various ServiceChannel clients may have differing status code mappings. This release extends the SAMPro Registry to allow multiple status mapping sets based on the Workorder's Client Id (derived from the Job in the WO header).</p>
<p>To create a set of Status Mappings in the SAMPro sys-fmms-vendor-ServiceChannel Registry for a specific Client, append a '-' and the Client Id to the 'StatusMappings' key.</p>
<p style="text-decoration: underline;">Example:</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: bold;">Id:</span> sys-fmms-vendor-ServiceChannel</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: bold;">Setting Key:</span> &#160;StatusMappings-Wendys &#160;&#160;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: bold;">Setting Value:</span> Acknowledged:DISPATCH CONFIRMED</p>
<p style="margin-left: 48px;"><span style="font-weight: bold;">Tip:</span><br />
Make sure that a StatusMappings option without the Client Id appended is retained for general use.</p>
<h3>21.2.12 &#160;Registry to Delay ServiceChannel Upload of Work Performed</h3>
<p>An earlier release supported the sending of 'Equipment Work Performed' notes to ServiceChannel on Work Order Status changes. This could be an issue because TechAnywhere may not upload the equipment information to SAMPro for some minutes after the Status Change is uploaded.<br style="color: #000000; font-family: Verdana, 'Helvetica Neue', Helvetica, Arial, sans-serif; font-size: 14px; font-style: normal; font-variant-ligatures: normal; font-variant-caps: normal; font-weight: 400; letter-spacing: normal; orphans: 2; text-align: start; text-indent: 0px; text-transform: none; white-space: normal; widows: 2; word-spacing: 0px; -webkit-text-stroke-width: 0px; text-decoration-style: initial; text-decoration-color: initial;" />
<br style="margin-bottom: 0px; color: #000000; font-family: Verdana, 'Helvetica Neue', Helvetica, Arial, sans-serif; font-size: 14px; font-style: normal; font-variant-ligatures: normal; font-variant-caps: normal; font-weight: 400; letter-spacing: normal; orphans: 2; text-align: start; text-indent: 0px; text-transform: none; white-space: normal; widows: 2; word-spacing: 0px; -webkit-text-stroke-width: 0px; text-decoration-style: initial; text-decoration-color: initial;" />
This release supports a Registry-specified delay between the posting of the Status change and the sending of the Equipment Work Performed notes. The assumption is that by providing a sufficient delay, TechAnywhere will have uploaded the required Equipment information before the delay expires.</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: bold;">Id:</span> sys-fmms-vendor-ServiceChannel</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: bold;">Setting Key:</span> EquipmentWorkPerformedDelaySeconds &#160;<span style="font-weight: bold;">Setting Value:</span> <span style="font-style: italic;"><i>delay in seconds</i></span></p>
<p><span style="text-decoration: underline;"><u>Example:</u></span> The following will delay the sending of the Equipment Work Performed message for 30 minutes following the status change. The default delay is zero seconds.</p>
<p>Setting Key: EquipmentWorkPerformedDelaySeconds &#160;Setting Value: 1800</p>
<h2>21.3 Upload Work Order Documents</h2>
<p style="margin-left: 8px;"><img src="image/ServiceChannel_Upld_new.gif" alt="" style="border: none;" border="0" /></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: bold;">New Button: ServiceChannel Upload</span><br />
A new 'ServiceChannel Upload' button will appear on the Document Viewer's list and record screens if the Work Order is integrated with ServiceChannel. Pressing this button from the Document list will give a checklist of all attachments to allow the user to select multiple attachments to send at once. Pressing from the Document record will upload that single attachment. The attachment(s) will be emailed to ServiceChannel where they will be processed at a set interval and attached to the ServiceChannel system.</p>
<h2>21.4 Reverse Posted Invoices (ServiceChannel)</h2>
<p>When ServiceChannel work order are billed, the invoice is automatically uploaded to ServiceChannel. In previous releases, if the invoice was reversed and re-invoiced, the only way to handle this was to manually press the Submit button in the invoice master.</p>
<p>This release supports the automatic resending of the re-invoiced invoice. Specifically, when an Invoice Master is marked as 'Reversed', any FMMSInfo records meeting the following requirements are located:</p>
<p style="margin-left: 48px;">The FMMSInfo record's wrkordr_rn field matches the reversed Invoice Master's srvceinvce_wrkordr_rn field.</p>
<p style="margin-left: 48px;">The FMMSInfo record has it's fmmsinfo_invce_qd column set to "Y".</p>
<p style="margin-left: 48px;">IF any such FMMSInfo records are found, their fmmsinfo_invce_qd column is reset to 'N'.</p>
<h2>21.5 Service Channel Invoices with No Materials</h2>
<p style="margin-left: 8px;">The Service Channel i.14 invoice template requires that materials are used to complete the job; ServiceChannel will reject the invoice if it doesn't contain material information. Since all jobs do not require materials, this release will add a dummy $0 material line to get around this requirement. The Material Description of 'No Material Required' will be used on the $0 line to conform to ServiceChannel requirements.</p>
<h2>22 &#160;DBAnalytics / KPI's</h2>

<h3>24.0.2 Setting Up SubAnywhere</h3>
<p style="margin-left: 8px;">Your support representative will set up the basic framework of SubAnywhere, but the following records may need to be updated in SAMPro:</p>
<p style="margin-left: 48px;">Technician Record:</p>
<p style="margin-left: 88px;">Main Tab: &#160;Vendor Id is specified</p>
<p style="margin-left: 88px;">Web Access Tab: Web Access = Subcontractor, Remote Device Type = SubAnywhere</p>
<p style="margin-left: 48px;">Vendor Record:</p>
<p style="margin-left: 88px;">Defaults Tab: verify that the Rate Schedule Id is properly completed. SubAnywhere only allows the Other Rates on the selected Schedule to be entered.&#160;</p>
<p style="margin-left: 48px;">Rate Schedules &#160;for Vendors:</p>
<p style="margin-left: 88px;">Only the Other Rate column needs to be completed. &#160;The Other Rate Table defines which Other Rates your Subs will be allowed to choose in SubAnywhere from their drop-down charges list.</p>
<p style="margin-left: 48px;">Other Rate Tables for Vendors:</p>
<p style="margin-left: 88px;">If you have negotiated rates, the Rate column should be completed with the price the Sub will charge your company; SubAnywhere users will NOT be able override the price or description when they enter this charge.</p>
<p style="margin-left: 88px;">If the Rate column is empty, &#160;the SubAnywhere user can enter price and unique description.</p>
<p style="margin-left: 48px;">Site Equipment:</p>
<p style="margin-left: 88px;">Main Tab: An override to the Vendor’s Rate Schedules may be specified in the Equipment record's Service Provider / Rate Schedule field. &#160;For example, special higher negotiated rates might exist for equipment located in Manhattan. In this case, this override would be use to generate the Charges drop down list in SubAnywhere for this equipment.</p>

This field controls whether PO’s are created as Released (None) or Unreleased (SubAnywhere). &#160;If a particular subcontractor should not have access to SubAnywhere, set the Remote Device Type to None. The Web Access field should be set to Subcontractor if you want to auto-generate PO’s for them when a Work Order is created in New Call or Create PM WorkOrders; this is true whether or not SubAnywhere is enabled.</p>
<h5>New Call, Create PM Work Orders</h5>
<p style="margin-left: 8px;">When a Work Order is created for a SubAnywhere subcontractor tech in New Call or via Create PM Work Orders, the PO that is simultaneously created will be set to Unreleased to conform to SubAnywhere requirements. To be considered a SubAnywhere tech, the Technician record must: reference a Vendor record; have the Web Access field set to Subcontractor, and have the Remote Device Type set to the new option of SubAnywhere.</p>
<h5>Work Order Create Sub PO</h5>
<p>When SubAnywhere subcontractor is added to a Work Order, the PO that is generated for the sub (either automatically or by clicking the Create Sub PO button) will be set to Unreleased to conform to SubAnywhere requirements. To be considered a SubAnywhere tech, the Technician record must: reference a Vendor record; have the Web Access field set to Subcontractor, and have the Remote Device Type set to the new option of SubAnywhere.</p>
<h3>24.1.2 <span style="font-weight: bold;">Create PM WOs for SubAnywhere Techs</span></h3>
<p>When a PO is generated for a SubAnywhere Tech, the initial PO status is now set to Released if it will include GEN lines. This prevents SubAnywhere users from adding charges to PO's that already have a cost associated with it from the Equipment's PM Schedule's Contract Cost. The SubAnywhere PO will be set to Unreleased if it does not include a GEN line. &#160;The PO's Release Date will not be completed if the PO is Unreleased.</p>
<p>In earlier releases, the Status for a SubAnywhere PO was set to Unreleased regardless of whether or not it included GEN lines.</p>
<h2>24.2 Registry</h2>
<h3>24.2.1 Registry Start NetFramework Post</h3>
<p>The Start NetFramework Post function provides a SubAnywhere Scheduled Event Manager for Document Uploads. Specifically, it handles messages for SAMNetFramework applications such as SubAnywhere.&#160;Currently, this function supports handling Document Uploads in a fashion similar to DashboardEventManager and Start Dashboard Post.&#160;&#160;This function should be implemented by adding the Start NetFramework Post to a scheduled event to be run at an interval of your choosing. The following registry is required.</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: bold;">Registry Id:</span> sys-netframework</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: bold;">Setting Key:</span> UploadFolder &#160;<span style="font-weight: bold;">Setting Value:</span> <span style="font-style: italic;"><i>Absolute file path</i></span></p>
<p>The UploadFolder setting is the default location where files from SAMNetFramework applications (e.g., SubAnywhere) are uploaded. &#160;This setting can be overridden by the registry of specific SAMNetFramework&#160;applications (note: for Sntfrmewrkpst to properly retrieve the file from the overridden location, "Application" must be specified in Message record contents).</p>
<h2>24.3 Work Order SubQuote Tab</h2>
<p style="margin-left: 8px;">This tab will be updated from the new SubAnywhere module's Quotes tab.</p>
<p style="margin-left: 8px;">Costing and other information (but not pricing) will be imported from this tab by the Quote Scope's Import Sub Quote wizard.</p>
<p><font style="font-weight: bold;">Quantity</font><br />
The number of this item/charge being quoted.</p>
<p><font style="font-weight: bold;">Other Rate Id:</font><br />
The Other Rate being quoted. &#160;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: bold;">Tech Id:</span><br />
The Subcontractor quoting this work</p>
<p><font style="font-weight: bold;">Unit Cost: &#160;&#160;Extended Cost:</font><br />
The Cost of the item/item being quoted. This is the price the Subcontractor is charging for the work. These fields will be defaulted from SubAnywhere. &#160;Manual entries to this tab do not default the cost.</p>
<p style="font-weight: bold;">Unit Price: &#160;Extended Price:<br />
<span style="font-weight: normal;">These fields will be ignored by the Quote Scope's Import Sub Quote wizard; the markup rules defined in the Scope (Rate Schedule, Markup % or Gross Margin %) will be applied to the imported costs to determine the Scope's revenues.</span></p>
<p><font style="font-weight: bold;">Description: &#160;Other Rate Description:</font><br />
The Description field must be completed in order for this line to be imported into a Quote Scope; this field will default from SubAnywhere. &#160;The display-only Other Rate Description appears for informational purposes.</p>
<p style="margin-left: 8px;"><span style="font-weight: bold;">Equipment Id:</span><br />
This field must be completed in order for this line to be imported into a Quote Scope.</p>
<h2>24.4 Quotes: Importing from the Work Order SubQuote Tab</h2>
<p>This functionality is available on the Quote Scope's Main tab and Quotemaster's Scope Tab.</p>
<p><img alt="" src="ImportSubCost.bmp" style="border: none;" border="0" /> &#160;New Button:</p>
<p>This functionality is designed for use with SubAnywhere. When clicked a wizard will be launched to import costing information from the SubQuote tab of the WO referenced in the Quote Manager/Master header. When the costs are imported, the markup rules defined in the Scope (Rate Schedule, Markup % or Gross Margin %) are applied to the imported costs to determine the Scope's revenues. This will be done even if Revenue has been entered on the Work Order's SubQuote tab.</p>
<p style="margin-left: 48px;">Note: Wizard Requirements<br />
If no lines from the WO SubQuote Tab match the Equip. Id on the Scope, a message stating “No Sub Quote lines found to import matching the Equipment Id on the Scope” will appear.</p>
<p style="margin-left: 48px;">If the WO Id is not completed in the Quote Manager, the following message will be displayed: &#160;“No Sub Quote lines found to import matching the Work Order Id on the Quote”.</p>
<h1>25 DBSellpoint Point of Sale</h1>
<h2>25.1 Overview</h2>
<p><span style="unicode-bidi: embed; mso-line-break-override: none; word-break: normal; punctuation-wrap: hanging;">DBSellPoint is a point of sales app developed to handle over the counter and retail sales transactions for SAMPro. Payments can be made with cash or credit card, or on account for existing customers. The app is designed to be run on an A</span>ndroid tablet with a credit card scanner, barcode scanner, and a cash drawer.</p>
<p>Returns of DBSellPoint sales are also supported in the app. A Powerpoint presentation focusing using the app itself is available.</p>
<h2>25.2 New Function - Start Point of Sale Scheduled Event Manager</h2>
<p>This function posts messages (transactions entered in the DBSellPoint app) to the SAMPro database. It is responsible for generating the needed AR Sales Journal, Invoice Master, Inventory History, Job History and Cash Receipts in SAMPro. It handles both DBSellPoint Sales and Returns.</p>
<p>This function will be configured to run automatically by support when it is installed.</p>
<h2>25.3 Setting Up SAMPro for DBSellpoint</h2>
<p style="font-weight: bold;"><span><span style="font-weight: bold;">GL Entities are derived as follows:</span></span></p>
<p style="margin-left: 48px;">ENTB = Balance Sheet Entity (from Company)</p>
<p style="margin-left: 48px;">ENTI = Income Statement Entity (from Site COP tab)</p>
<p style="margin-left: 8px; font-weight: bold;">Posting of POS sales should use the Entity defined above as follows in posting:</p>
<p style="margin-left: 48px;">1) Cash Receipts Records</p>
<p style="margin-left: 88px;">a. GL Entity – use Company ENTB – arrcpts.glentty.rn</p>
<p style="margin-left: 48px;">2) &#160;AR Sales Records</p>
<p style="margin-left: 88px;">a. AR Control Entity – use Company ENTB – arsls.glentty.rn</p>
<p style="margin-left: 88px;">b. Entities for GL Posting</p>
<p style="margin-left: 128px;">i.All Sales Lines, Entity = Site COP ENTI<br />
ii.All Expense (cost) Lines, Entity = Site COP ENTI<br />
iii.Accounts Receivable, Entity = Company ENTB<br />
iv.All Sales Tax Lines, Entity = Company ENTB<br />
v.All Inventory, Entity = Company ENTB</p>
<p style="margin-left: 48px;">3) AR Terms</p>
<p style="margin-left: 128px;">When Invoices are posted from DBSellpoint, the Invoice's Due Date, Discount Date, Discount Available are now set based on its AR Terms.</p>
<h3>25.3.1 &#160;RAQ: Default Cash / Client Site: Walk Up Customer</h3>
<p>A default customer (Client Site) must be set up for walk up cash/credit customers where the sale will not be for &#160;'on account' or cash sales to an existing customer. The RAQ configDefaultCustomer (site RN) &#160;defines the default customer (site) that comes up on POS initial screen. This record will be configured by support when your system is set up.</p>
<h3><span style="font-weight: bold;">25.3.2 Payment Type: GL Bank Account for Cash Receipts Entry</span></h3>
<p>When an AR Cash Receipts entry is posted from DBSellpoint, the GL Bank Account will default from the Payment Type selected on the POS screen.</p>
<h3>25.3.3 Returns Processing</h3>
<p style="margin-left: 48px;"><span style="font-weight: bold;">NOTE:</span> If a dollar limit for cash reimbursements is exceeded, a return will require submitting paperwork to accounting and a check gets cut to the customer at some future date. &#160;In that scenario, SAMPro provides no automated help in managing the debt or producing the payment. &#160;Accounting must create a Vendor record and the appropriate AP Journal entry so the customer eventually gets paid/reimbursed as a 'vendor'.</p>
<p style="margin-left: 8px;">Returns are defined by messages including the key 'Return=true'? &#160;If the customer is reimbursed (cash, credit card credit, etc), the DBSellpoint app will also provide that information so the appropriate negative Cash Receipt can be generated.</p>
<p style="margin-left: 8px;">The posting depends on whether or not the customer was reimbursed at the POS counter.</p>
<p style="margin-left: 48px;">If the customer is reimbursed:</p>
<p style="margin-left: 88px;">The return is treated as a Credit Memo and posts the appropriate Sales and Cash Receipts transactions.</p>
<p style="margin-left: 88px;">In the Sales Journal, the Invoice Id will be generated by appending the letters CM will to the original POS Invoice Id (e.g.,143234CM). The Transaction Description will be set to 'POS Return Entry'.</p>
<p style="margin-left: 88px;">The Cash Receipts entry will be made with negative receipts and a Transaction Description will be set to 'POS Return Entry'.</p>
<p style="margin-left: 48px;">If not reimbursed:</p>
<p style="margin-left: 48px;">Only a Sales Journal entry will be made using the Costs tab of the Sales Journal to effectively put the Return 'On Account' for the customer. &#160;The Client specified in the Sales Journal will be derived from the Client listed on the Site's COP tab.</p>
<p style="margin-left: 8px;">A Restocking Fee may be assessed in the DBSellpoint return which will reduce the amount of the return. The RestockGLAccount registry detailed in Customer Note 25.4.3 may be used to specify the GL Account restocking fees will post to. If this <span style="text-indent: -.25in; mso-list: l0 level1 lfo1;">registry is absent the Sales GL Account will be used.</span></p>
<p style="margin-left: 8px;">If the registry is not set, the return amount for each line will be the original sales less the restocking fee. &#160;If the registry is enabled then the difference on each line between the original sales and return amount will be posted to the Restock Account.</p>
<h2>25.4 Registry Settings</h2>
<h3>25.4.1 User Registry Tab: Default Location/Tax Group for DBSellpoint</h3>
<p>The Sales Tax Group on the default Client Site's COP tab is the one for the brick and mortar DBSellpoint location the DBSellpoint User is stationed at. <span style="font-weight: bold;">This Sales Tax Group will be used for ALL DBSellpoint transactions.</span> The default Site must be specified in the User's Registry tab for each DBSellpoint User.</p>
