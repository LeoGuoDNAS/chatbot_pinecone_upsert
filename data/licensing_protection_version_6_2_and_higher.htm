<P class="Support_Heading_1" >Licensing Protection - Version 6.2 and Higher</P>
 <P class="support" >Beginning with the release of v6.2, use of a vrgstry.cus file is a requirement – even if the registry is disabled in the v.cus file or if you are running in development mode. This means pre-v6.2 registry files must be replaced during the conversion to v6.2. The same process will apply as each new version is released and installed.</P>
 <P class="support" >If you are setting up a v6.2 test environment for an existing user, the 6.2 zip file now includes a vrgstryWinII.cus file.&nbsp; This file can be used on a temporary basis (it will need to be renamed vrgstry.cus).&nbsp; It has all SAMPRO modules enabled, but it currently sets a limited expiration date and only allows two full-access user.</P>
 <P class="support" >Terreathe can make the permanent file for any installation that needs one.</P>
 <P class="Style1" >1.3.1 Users Database</P>
 <P class="support" >SAMPRO's user licensing technology has been enhanced to use the lgnhstry table from the main database instead of the usrstble in a separate Users database.&nbsp; If the LicenseMethod is set to LogonHistory in the vrgstry file, this enhanced license methodology will be used. </P>
 <P class="support" >This change should simplify both the installation and support of new and converted SAMPRO installations.&nbsp; Please note that the logon process no longer results in any uncommitted database transactions.</P>
 <P class="Style1" >1.3.2 Using the New Method</P>
 <P class="support" >A valid login uid &amp; password combination will never be denied, instead that log-in will be accepted and any current session for the same UID will be disabled (not logged out - DISABLED).&nbsp; The DISABLED session will be able to finish any unsaved edit, but will not be able to proceed otherwise.&nbsp; A message will then be displayed that the session is disabled and the account must be logged in again.&nbsp; This could go back and forth.</P>
 <P class="Style1" >1.3.3 Active User Count Strictly Enforced in 6.2</P>
 <P class="support" >Version 6.2 and up strictly enforce the number of active users specified in the vrgstry file. This is a change from 6.1, where a greater number of users flagged as ‘active’ was permitted as long as no more than the allowed number were logged on concurrently.  If this impacts your users, they may purchase additional licenses.  The ‘sharing’ of a seat license is not to be encouraged as all history of an individual user is lost.  This practice has negative ramifications for system security since individual responsibility for transactions is not maintained. </P>
 <P class="Style1" >1.3.4 Logon History Viewer</P>
 <P class="support" >A viewer has been created for the lgnhstry table as of 6.2.408.000.b0314; run the Start Function Update function to see the new viewer if needed.  This viewer allows for the termination of active sessions.  </P>
