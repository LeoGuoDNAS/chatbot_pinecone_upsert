<h1>Earnings Group Viewer</h1>
<h2>Purpose:</h2>
<p>Typically used to create and maintain the Earnings Groups used to implement 
 union payroll on your system.</p>
<h2>Example:</h2>
<p>Create Earning Groups for Journeymen, Apprentices, Masters, etc. for 
 each labor union.</p>
<h2>Usage:</h2>
<p>Specify the various earnings types applicable to each class of employees 
 for the time periods that you define. Earnings Groups are typically used 
 for union payroll.</p>
<h2>Registry:</h2>
<p><span><a href="Registry_Earnings_Group.htm">Registry Earnings Group</a> 
 - sort Earnings by End Date. </span></p>
<h2>Important Fields:</h2>
<p><font style="font-weight: bold;">Note:</font> this Help Topic lists 
 the standard configuration of all fields that may be included in this 
 record. If you are using a customized system, the fields displayed on 
 your screen may not exactly match the order or status (required, optional, 
 default, display-only, hidden, etc.) of the fields described in this Topic.</p>
<p>The upper section of the screen consists of the data-entry fields that 
 identify this group. The lower section of the screen lists the Earnings 
 records comprising this group (e.g., wages, fringes, medical, pension, 
 etc.).</p>
<h2>Important Fields: Upper Section</h2>
<p><font style="font-weight: bold;">Earnings Group Id:</font> (15 character, 
 only . and - special characters)<br/>
A unique Id for this table. This field is required.</p>

<p><font style="font-weight: bold;">Earnings Group Name:</font> (30 character)<br/>
A brief description of this table. This field is optional but highly recommended.</p>
<p><font style="font-weight: bold;">Union Id:</font><br/>
The Union Id this group is associated with. Double-click on this field 
 to select from a list of Unions.</p>
<p><font style="font-weight: bold;">Classification Id:</font><br/>
This optional field is designed for reporting purposes. If used, it should 
 describe the union classification of employees associated with this Earnings 
 Group (Foremen, Apprentices, etc.,). It enables reporting on various classes 
 of employees within a single union or across all unions. See <a href="Union_Classification_Viewer.htm">Union 
 Classification Viewer</a> for further information.</p>
<p><font style="font-weight: bold;">Earnings Group <span>User1-5:</span></font><br/>
These optional fields may be used for entering any information your company 
 wishes to retain (e.g., additional account numbers) for payroll setup.</p>
<p><font style="font-weight: bold;">Obsolete</font><font style="font-weight: bold;">?</font><font style="font-weight: bold;"><br/>
</font>If this field is checked, the record is considered Obsolete, and 
 it may not be directly specified during data-entry (either by entering 
 the Id or selecting it from a list). Obsoleted records can be edited and 
 the Obsolete option can be un-done when necessary. When you check the 
 Obsolete field, the following message box will be displayed:</p>
<p style="margin-left: 36.00pt;">“You have elected to obsolete this record. 
 Would you like to see existing references to this record?”</p>
<p>If you click Yes, the system will display a viewer that provides click-through 
 access to all tables referencing this record: see <a href="References_List.htm">References 
 List</a> for details.</p>
<p><font style="font-weight: bold;">Security Id:</font><br/>
If multiple location security is implemented on your centralized database 
 system, this informational field typically displays the Security Id of 
 the local user that created this record unless it is listed as an exception 
 to use global security. If multiple location security is not implemented 
 on your system, or if this record was created by a global user, this field 
 will be blank.</p>
<h2>Important Fields: Lower Section</h2>
<p><font style="font-weight: bold;">Earnings Id:</font><br/>
Enter a valid Earnings Id or double-click on this field to select from 
 a list.</p>
<p><font style="font-weight: bold;">Amount:</font><br/>
The dollar amount per Amount Type unit (hourly or salary) or percentage 
 for Percent of Wages Amount Types.</p>
<p><font style="font-weight: bold;">Amount Type:</font><br/>
This field specifies what the Amount field represents: hourly (for hourly 
 amounts), salary (for salary amounts), or Percent (if the amount represents 
 a percent of wages).</p>
<p>The Amount Type of Fixed (per Payroll Period) is available for Fringes. 
 This could be used to record taxable, company-owned vehicle usage. Validation 
 ensures that the Amount Type of Fixed may only be selected if all of the 
 following are true:</p>
<p style="margin-left: 48px;">The Earnings Type is set to Fringe<br/>
The Fringe is not Accrued<br/>
The Fringe is not Job Costed</p>
<p><font style="font-weight: bold;">Start Date: End Date:</font><br/>
The time period this amount is valid for (e.g., fiscal year, contract period, 
 etc.) If more than one line is entered for the same earnings id, the dates 
 must <font style="font-weight: bold;">NOT</font> overlap. The system now 
 validates that no overlap occurs for each Earnings Id/Pay Type combination.</p>
<p><font style="font-weight: bold;">Add Pay Rate Factor?</font><br/>
Check this box (by double-clicking or pressing the Spacebar) if this Earnings 
 record should be multiplied by the Pay Rate factor (regular, overtime, 
 doubletime, etc.) when making journal entries. For example, you would 
 probably check this box for hourly wages or payroll taxes, but leave it 
 blank for medical earnings.</p>
<p><font style="font-weight: bold;">Wage Fringe N/A</font><br/>
These display-only fields default from the Earning record, and define whether 
 these earnings are categorized as wages, fringes or not applicable (job 
 costing earnings) for journal entries.</p>
<p><font style="font-weight: bold;">Description</font><br/>
This display-only field lists a brief description of this Earnings record.</p>
<p><font style="font-weight: bold;">Taxable? Job Cost Labor Journal? Job 
 Cost PR Check? Accrue?</font><br/>
These display-only fields default from the Earning record.</p>
<h2><img src="assets/images/image/Magnify.gif" alt="" style="border: none;" border="0"/> 
 Click the Magnify Button to view the following fields:</h2>
<p><font style="font-weight: bold;">Pay Type:<br/>
</font>This field should only be completed to enable an alternative way 
 of determining overtime or double-time pay. This would be done if overtime 
 isn&#39;t at a 1.5 multiplier.  In this setup, you would create 
 two earnings lines for base wages for the same Earnings Id:</p>
<p style="margin-left: 36.00pt;">The first earnings line for base wages 
 would be your regular one; the Pay Type would NOT be filled in.</p>
<p style="margin-left: 36.00pt;">The second earnings line for base wages 
 line would be for the same Earnings Id, but with the Pay Type Id completed. 
 Typically, it would point to an OT Pay Type with its Rate Factor set to 
 1.0; . In addition, you would specify the actual OT pay rate in the earnings 
 line. This line would be used instead of the first ONLY IF the Pay Type 
 matched on the Labor lines entered.</p>
<p style="margin-left: 36.00pt;">Example:</p>
<p style="margin-left: 36.00pt;">Earnings Id: Amount: Pay Type 
 Id: <br/>
base  27 <br/>
base  43 OT (rate factor = 1.0. Hours Type=Worked, Category=Overtime)</p>
<p style="margin-left: 36.00pt;">In this example, when time was entered 
 using a Pay Type of ‘OT’, the base earnings would be calculated as $43.00 
 instead of $40.50 per hour (27.00x1.5). In the traditional SAMPRO setup, 
 the line 2 entry would not exist and the Pay Type would have a Rate Factor 
 of 1.5.  In that scenario the employee&#39;s OT pay rate would be 
 $40.50 per hour (27.00x1.5).</p>
<p><font style="font-weight: bold;">Add to Wages for Wage-Based Fringes?</font> 
 (eligible for lines that are both &quot;fringe&quot; &amp; &quot;hourly&quot;)</p>
<p><font style="font-weight: bold;">Subject to Fringe Additions</font><font style="font-weight: bold;">?</font> (eligible for lines that are (&quot;fringe&quot; 
 or &quot;n/a&quot;) &amp; &quot;hourly&quot;)</p>
<p>These fields provide the ability to include certain fringes (deferred 
 compensation) in the basis &quot;wages&quot; for percentage calculations 
 of other fringe benefits. This functionality was required to satisfy payroll 
 for a specific union contract, where the 401a (a union equivalent of 401k) 
 must be separated from the base wage for some calculations but not for 
 others.</p>
<p style="margin-left: 36.00pt;"><font style="text-decoration: underline; ">Example:</font><font style="text-decoration: underline; ">Include 401(a) fringe in calculation 
 of H&amp;W fringe</font><font style="text-decoration: underline; "><br/>
</font>Example:<br/>
Wage  $38<br/>
401(a) $2<br/>
H&amp;W 5% (needs to evaluate as 5% of $40=$2)<br/>
<br/>
In this example...<br/>
401(a) is an hourly-based fringe with the Add box checked in &quot;Add 
 to Wages for Wage-Based Fringes?&quot;.<br/>
H&amp;W is a percent-based fringe with the Subject box checked in &quot;Subject 
 to Fringe Additions?&quot;.<br/>
<br/>
Prior to this mod, the H&amp;W fringe for each hour worked would have been 
 computed as $38 x .05.  By setting the new options as indicated 
 in the example, the computation becomes ($38 + $2) x .05.</p>
