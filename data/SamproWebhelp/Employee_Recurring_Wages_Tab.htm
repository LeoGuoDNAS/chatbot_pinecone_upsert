<h1>Employee Recurring Wages Tab</h1>
<h2>Purpose:</h2>
<p>This tab is used in conjunction with the Start Generate Recurring Labor 
 Entries function (see <a href="Start_Generate_Recurring_Labor_Entries.htm">Start 
 Generate Recurring Labor Entries</a> ) to generate labor journal entries 
 for workers that typically record a standard number of hours to a particular 
 job or jobs. These journal entries may then be edited if needed. Managerial, 
 IT or administrative workers whose hours are always applied to overhead 
 jobs would be good candidates for this tab.</p>
<h2>Registry:</h2>
<p>The Employee Recurring Wages tab includes 
 Earnings Group and Deduction Group fields in the detail view. However, 
 when the Recurring Labor is posted, the system uses the Earning and Deduction 
 Groups from the Employee Defaults tab by default. <a href="Registry_Entry_Labor_Journal_Certified_PR_Warning.htm#Control_Recurring_Labor_Earnings_and_Deduction_Groups_Defaults">A 
 Labor Journal Registry</a> setting may be used to include Earnings and 
 Deduction Groups from the Employee Recurring Wages tab for Recurring Labor 
 entries. </p>
<h3>Usage:</h3>
<p>When setting up this tab, careful thought should be given to how your 
 Payroll Periods are structured. The days specified on this tab should 
 map to the time period covered by the payroll period. For example, this 
 tab would not be suitable for use with monthly pay periods that began 
 on the first day of the month – regardless of what day of the week it 
 was. It would be suitable for weekly or bi-weekly pay periods that always 
 began on the same day of the week.</p>
<p>See <a href="Employee_Recurring_Other_Tab.htm">Employee Recurring Other 
 Tab</a> for entering recurring reimbursable expenses.</p>
<h3>Important Fields:</h3>
<p><font style="font-weight: bold;">Start Date:</font> (date format mmddyyyy) 
  <font style="font-weight: bold;">End Date:</font> (date format mmddyyyy)<br/>
Enter starting and ending <font style="font-weight: bold;">working</font> 
 dates to define the time period that this recurring entry is valid for. 
 These fields are compared with the date range of the selected payroll 
 period when the Generate Recurring Labor Entries function is run. If 
 the Start/End Dates intersect at ANY point within the Payroll Period Start/End 
 (work) dates, then the line qualifies as &quot;eligible&quot; when Start 
 Generate Recurring Labor Entries is run. </p>
<p><font style="font-weight: bold;">Cycle:<br/>
</font>This field defines the cycle for which this recurring entry would 
 be generated. For example, M (monthly), Q (quarterly), W (weekly), P (payroll 
 period) and so on. The Generate Recurring Labor Entries function checks 
 this field against the Cycle Code that you entered on the Recurring Wages 
 tab of the Employee Record. It is recommended that a Cycle Code always 
 be specified when running this function.</p>
<p><font style="font-weight: bold;">Day in Period:</font><br/>
This field controls which day in the payroll period the generated labor 
 journal entry will be assigned to.</p>
<p style="margin-left: 36.00pt;"><font style="font-weight: bold;">Examples:</font></p>
<p class="Reference_Line" style="margin-left: 36.00pt; margin-bottom: 0.00pt;">Suppose 
 your payroll periods are one week in length, and begin on Thursday. For 
 your employees that work on Monday – Friday, you would create recurring 
 entries for days 1 (Thursday), 2 (Friday), 5 (Monday), 6 (Tuesday) and 
 7 (Wednesday).</p>
<p class="Reference_Line" style="margin-left: 36.00pt; margin-bottom: 0.00pt;">Alternately, 
 if your payroll periods are bi-weekly and being on Monday, you would create 
 recurring lines for days 1-5 and 8-12.</p>
<p class="Reference_Line" style="margin-bottom: 0.00pt;"><font style="font-weight: bold;">Hours: 
 Pay Type Id:<br/>
Job Id: Cost Code: Cost Category:<br/>
</font>Complete these fields as you wish them to appear when the Labor 
 Journal Entries are generated by this function. The 
 Cost Category supports enhanced filtering provided by the Cost Code&#39;s 
 Job Cost Category Usage Filter.</p>
<p class="Reference_Line" style="margin-bottom: 0.00pt;"><span style="font-weight: bold;">Bonus Amount</span><br/>
This field may be used to pay flat per-period amounts such as Car Allowances. 
 It will be written to the corresponding Bonus field in the Labor Journal. 
  If this field is completed, the Hours field should be blank, and 
 an appropriate Pay Type must be selected (Hours Type and Category should 
 both be set to Other).</p>
<p class="Reference_Line" style="margin-bottom: 0.00pt;"><img src="assets/images/image/Magnify.gif" alt="" style="border: none;" border="0"/>  Click the Magnify 
 button to view the following fields.</p>
<p class="Reference_Line" style="margin-bottom: 0.00pt;"><font style="font-weight: bold;">Billing 
 Item:<br/>
</font> This field should be completed if these recurring hours are billable 
 to the above Job.</p>
<p class="Reference_Line" style="margin-bottom: 0.00pt;"><font style="font-weight: bold;">Labor 
 Rate Id: <br/>
</font>This  field may be used to override the Labor Rate located 
 in on the Defaults tab of the Employee record.</p>
<p class="Reference_Line" style="margin-bottom: 0.00pt;"><font style="font-weight: bold;">WorkOrder 
 Id:</font><br/>
This field would only be completed if these recurring hours were charged 
 to a specific work order. This is not recommended.</p>
<p class="Reference_Line" style="margin-bottom: 0.00pt; font-weight: bold;">Earning 
 Group Id: - Deductions Group Id:<br/>
<span style="font-weight: normal;">When the Recurring Labor is posted, 
 the system uses the Earning and Deduction Groups from the Employee Defaults 
 tab by default.</span> </p>
<p>Version 9.1.611.057 and above supports a<a href="Registry_Entry_Labor_Journal_Certified_PR_Warning.htm#Control_Recurring_Labor_Earnings_and_Deduction_Groups_Defaults"> 
 Labor Journal Registry</a> for including Earnings and Deduction Groups 
 from the Employee Recurring Wages tab for Recurring Labor entries.</p>
