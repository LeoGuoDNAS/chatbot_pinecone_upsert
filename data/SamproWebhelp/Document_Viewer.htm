  <h1>Document Attachment Viewer</h1>
  <h2>Purpose:</h2>
  <p>The Document viewer has several purposes:</p>
  <p style="margin-left: 17.25pt;">The Document viewer enables you to associate documents (CAD drawings, specification, etc.) with specific records within your SAM Pro database when you click the Attachments button.</p>
  <p style="margin-left: 17.25pt;">The Document Viewer may also accessed to implement <a href="Custom_Help_Setup.htm">Custom Help Documents</a> for your system.</p>
  <p style="margin-left: 23px;">Saved SAMPro reports (such as invoices, statements, etc.) are attached to a Document record when they are saved/archived. Any time a DBR report is saved, it stores the registry values in the DBR file itself. Namely, the bitmap directory. When that DBR file is opened in SAMPro, it will recall the old bitmap directory to go out and find the logo to print to screen. See <a href="Saved_Reports_and_Bitmaps.htm">Saved Reports and Bitmaps</a> for additional steps SAMPro may take to locate the bitmap.</p>
  
  
  
  
  <p class="Support" style="margin-left: 8px;"></p>
  <h2>Usage:</h2>
  <p>You may scan in files from a local scanner. By default, scanned files will be saved as .jpg images. OCR is not currently supported.</p>
  <p style="margin-left: 36.00pt;">
    <font style="font-weight: bold;">Files Originally Scanned as PDF’s:</font><br/>
    By default, the Scan Document Wizard saves the scanned documents as .jpg files. If you opt to save scanned documents as .pdf files via registry, each page will be saved as a separate .pdf file. Additional pages must be accessed from the Other Files tab of the Document Viewer: individual .pdf files will not be combined for viewing like .jpg and .bmp files.
  </p>
  <h2>Examples:</h2>
  <p style="margin-left: 36.00pt;">
    <font style="font-weight: bold; text-decoration: underline; ">Attachments Example: Back Office</font>
  </p>
  <p style="margin-left: 36.00pt;">For example, you could associate a specific CAD drawing with three equipment records, an inventory item record, and a vendor record.</p>
  <p class="Normal_Indent"><img alt="" border="0" src="assets/images/image/SKIN1_AttachmentsOn.gif" style="border: none;"/></p>
  <p style="margin-left: 36.00pt;">In this case, when a SAM Pro user clicks the Attachment button in an equipment record referencing the CAD drawing, a list of documents associated with this record would appear. When you select from the listing, the file will be opened within its native application (e.g., the registered software program specified on your desktop or Citrix session). Note that if Autocad were installed on your Windows desktop or Citrix session, you would be able to open the drawing; if a CAD program was not installed, you would not be able to open the file.</p>
  <p style="margin-left: 36.00pt;">
    <font style="font-weight: bold; text-decoration: underline; ">Attachments Example: Web Interface</font><br/>
    Suppose a Client logs on the Client Web Interface and accesses a work order that includes attached documents that we flagged as FM Web Viewable. The Client would simply click on the attachment. If it can be viewed from the Web, it will open. If it cannot be viewed from the Web, a Download box will appear, enabling the Client to download the file.
  </p>
  <p style="margin-left: 36.00pt;">
    <font style="font-weight: bold; text-decoration: underline; ">Attachments Example: Scheduled Events E-mails</font><br/>
    Your firm may wish to create some standard documents for possible attachment to scheduled events for work orders created in New Call. These documents will be added to the document table and their category assigned to match those entered in the <a href="Registry_Entry_for_New_Call_Options.htm">Registry Entry for New Call Options</a>.
  </p>
  <p>
    <font color="#FF0000" style="font-weight: bold; font-style: italic;">File Format:</font><br/>
    Remember that the user must have software that enables them to view your attached documents. Files such as jpeg&#39;s, Word Documents, and Excel spreadsheets are accessible to more users than, for example, CAD drawings. If you will to attach documents that can easily be viewed and printed from the vast majority of system, Adobe Acrobat (.pdf) is a good choice.
  </p>
  <h2>Usage:</h2>
  <p style="margin-left: 8px;">

  <p>
    <font style="font-weight: bold;">Step 3.</font> Complete the fields in the upper section of the screen as discussed below.
  </p>
  <p>
    <font style="font-weight: bold;">Step 4.</font> If you wish to associate the document with other records in the system, add one or more lines to the Reference tab screen as discussed below.
  </p>
  <p>
    <font style="font-weight: bold;">Step 5.</font> Click the Add record button (or the Save button if you are changing an existing record).
  </p>
  <p>Once a file has been referenced as a SAMPro document, a copy of it will be stored in the archive location.  </p>
  <h3>Work Order Document Viewer - Service Channel</h3>
  <p style="margin-left: 8px;"><img alt="" border="0" src="assets/images/image/ServiceChannel_Upld_new.gif" style="border: none;"/>  This button will appear on the Document Viewer&#39;s list and record screens if the Work Order is integrated with ServiceChannel. Pressing this button from the Document list will give a checklist of all attachments to allow the user to select multiple attachments to send at once. Pressing from the Document record will upload that single attachment. The attachment(s) will be emailed to ServiceChannel where they will be processed at a set interval and attached to the ServiceChannel system.</p>
  <h2>Important Fields: Upper Section</h2>
  <p>
    <font style="font-weight: bold;">Document Id:</font><br/>
    The system will generate this Id for you when you save the record.
  </p>

  <p>Click the Show Document button to view the file in its native application (if it is installed on your system). The Document record must have been saved in order to view the document.  If the file in the Document Viewer header is a bmp, jpg, png, pdf or gif AND the Document contains multiple images, SAM Pro offers the user the option of displaying the images as a single PDF file. At present, only  .PDF.,bmp, png, gif, and .jpg files will be assembled into the pdf.</p>
  <p style="margin-left: 36.00pt;">
    <font style="font-weight: bold;">Note: &quot;Windows Picture and Fax Viewer&quot;</font>

      system uses this program as the default viewer for image files, you will
      note that it has the arrows for browsing around the different pictures
      within the same folder. For example, suppose that you have the following
      pictures all in the same folder: Aa.jpg, Bb.jpg, Cc.jpg, Dd.jpg, Ee.jpg,
      Ff.jpg. If you were to have Sampro view document Cc.jpg, then by default
      when &quot;Windows Picture and Fax Viewer&quot; is launched, and it will
      give you the option to browse (left or right) through the pictures in
      that folder whether they are affiliated with that document or not!<br/>
      To avoid possible confusion, you may wish to view files with the .jpg extension
      with a different program (such as mspaint) that does <font style="text-decoration: underline; ">not</font>
      provide the browse option. To do so, follow the Windows instructions for
      ‘Associate a file with a program.&quot; Alternately, your support representative
      can implement a registry setting to associate files of this type with
      a particular program within SAM Pro only.</span>
