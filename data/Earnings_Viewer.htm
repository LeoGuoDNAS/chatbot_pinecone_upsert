<h1>Earnings Viewer</h1>
<h2>Purpose:</h2>
<p>Create and maintain the Earnings records for various types of wages, 
 fringes, and other compensation provided by your firm. You may also create 
 Earnings records to be used exclusively for Job Costing. </p>
<h2>Example:</h2>
<p>A separate Earnings record should be created for every type of GL &quot;breakout&quot; 
 you wish to show for: Salary, Pension, Medical, Job Costing Overhead, 
 Job Costing Payroll Taxes, etc.</p>

<h2>Usage:</h2>
<p>Earnings records are required for Payroll, and are referenced in the 
 Earnings Group records, the Earnings tab of the Payroll Adjustment Journal, 
 and the Employee record. The Unit Cost field in the WorkOrder Labor tab 
 and Labor Journals are defaulted from the Earnings Id&#39;s and used for Job 
 Costing. This record also specifies the GL Accounts to be debited and 
 credited during the Compute Payroll and Post Payroll to GL functions (if 
 not overridden by a GL Account in the Pay Type record).</p>
<p>Validation makes the user aware that Earnings records defined as &#39;non-taxable 
 wages&#39; do not make sense.</p>
<p><font style="font-weight: bold; text-decoration: underline; ">Canadian 
 Users:</font></p>
<p>Canadian T4&#39;s use the W2 Category fields in the Deductions &amp; Earnings 
 records to populate the Other Information boxes on the T4. The W2 category 
 must be filled in as OI:(Code # for T4). The Employee User 7 field is 
 used to print the registration number in box 50 on the T4.</p>
<p style="margin-left: 8px;">Enter Pension Adjustments using Earning Id&#39;s 
 with the W2 Category set to 52. These Pension Adjustment amounts will 
 be printed in Box 52.</p>
<p style="margin-left: 8px;">RPP Contribution amounts should be entered 
 using an Earnings Id with the W2 Category set to 20. These will be printed 
 on Box 20.</p>
<p style="margin-left: 8px;">Supports the processing of exempt earnings 
 for the calculation of Box 14 Employment Income.</p>





<h2>Important Fields:</h2>
<p><font style="font-weight: bold;">Note:</font> this Help Topic lists 
 the standard configuration of fields that may be included in this record. 
 If you are using a customized system, the fields displayed on your screen 
 may not match the fields described here.</p>
<p><font style="font-weight: bold;">Earnings Id:</font>(15 character, only 
 . and - special characters)<br/>
A unique Id for Earnings wages or fringes. This field is required.</p>
<p><font style="font-weight: bold;">Earnings Description:</font> (40 character)<br/>
A brief description. This field is optional but recommended.</p>
<p><font style="font-weight: bold;">Obsolete</font><font style="font-weight: bold;">?</font><font style="font-weight: bold;"><br/>
</font>If this field is checked, the record is considered Obsolete, and 
 it may not be directly specified during data-entry (either by entering 
 the Id or selecting it from a list). Obsoleted records can be edited and 
 the Obsolete option can be un-done when necessary. When you check the 
 Obsolete field, the following message box will be displayed:</p>
<p style="margin-left: 36.00pt;">“You have elected to obsolete this record. 
 Would you like to see existing references to this record?”</p>
<p>If you click Yes, the system will display a viewer that provides click-through 
 access to all tables referencing this record: see <a href="References_List.htm">References 
 List</a> for details.</p>
<p><font style="font-weight: bold;">Check Label:</font> (10 character)<br/>
The label you wish to appear on payroll checks for labor or fringes of 
 this type.</p>
<p><font style="font-weight: bold;">Cost Category Id:<br/>
</font>This field should be ONLY completed if this earnings record is used 
 for Type = &quot;FRINGE&quot; and &quot;JOB COST PR CHECK&quot; is also 
 checked. It is used by the system to post actual fringes vs. estimated 
 (source PR Check) during the POST CHECK function.</p>
<p style="margin-left: 36.00pt;"><font style="font-weight: bold;">Note:</font> 
 When entering time, the Cost Category defaults from the LABOR RATE (if 
 set) to capture WAGES. This is a requirement for TechAnywhere (as user 
 can not pick/select the cost category in TechAnywhere).</p>

 rate-based costs to Job History for privacy reasons for some or all of 
 its employees. For this setup:</p>
<p style="margin-left: 88px;">Earnings records of Type Wage would have 
 the Job Cost Labor Entry and Job Cost PR Check fields blank so they would 
 not be Job Costed. </p>
<p style="margin-left: 88px;">One or more Earnings records of Type Standard 
 Cost would be created with one of the Job Cost fields flagged.</p>
<p style="margin-left: 88px;"><span>Each employee this setup is applied 
 to would have a Wages line and a Standard Cost line on their Employee 
 Earnings Tab. The Wages line would be used for computing payroll, but

 is wages inclusive of PW overrides.</p>
<p><font style="font-weight: bold;">Taxable?</font><br/>
Check the Taxable box by double clicking on it (or pressing Spacebar) if 
 earnings of this type are taxable. For example, Earnings records created 
 for Job Costing (such as JC Overhead) and Pension Fringes would not be 
 taxable. An Earnings record for Salary would be taxable. See <a href="Registry_Entry_for_Taxable_Fringe_Benefits.htm">Registry 
 Compute Payroll</a> for an option to specify exceptions to Taxable Fringes 
 via the User1 or User2 fields.  </p>
<p><font style="font-weight: bold;">Job Cost Labor Entry?</font> <font style="font-weight: bold;"><br/>
</font>If earnings of this type are used for Job Costing purposes, check 
 the Job Cost box by double clicking on it (or pressing Spacebar); Job 
 Costing entries will be generated from Labor Journal (and Work Order Labor) 
 lines. Note that if this box is checked, the Job Cost PR Check? box should 
 remain blank. Note the Certified PR Report uses the Fringe Cost that is 
 written to Job Cost History.</p>
<p><font style="font-weight: bold;">Job Cost PR Check?<br/>
</font>If this box is checked, job cost entries for fringes of this type 
 will be generated when payroll is computed. Note that if this box is checked, 
 the Job Cost Labor Entry? box should remain blank. If this box is checked, 
 the registry option ImportPRCheckFromJCH=true should be set as described 
 in the <a href="Registry_Entry_to_Warn_if_Cost_Code_Requires_Certified_PR_Reporting.htm">Registry 
 Entry Work Order Options</a> topic.</p>
<p style="margin-left: 36.00pt;"><font style="font-weight: bold;">Generating

 types of allocated P/R expenses in job history.</p>
<p style="margin-left: 36.00pt;"><font style="font-weight: bold;">Setup 
 Tip:</font> When using the &quot;Job Cost PR Check&quot; method, you may 
 wish to set up multiple Cost Categories for: FRG-union1, FRG-union2, etc.</p>
<p style="margin-left: 36.00pt;"><font style="font-weight: bold;">Note</font><font style="font-weight: bold;">:</font> <font style="font-weight: bold;">GL 
 Expense Account and</font> <font style="font-weight: bold;">Overhead vs. 
 Non-Overhead Jobs</font><font style="font-weight: bold;">:</font></p>
<p style="margin-left: 36.00pt;">1. When the fringe is being charged to 
 an overhead job, the GL Account is the debit account from the fringe Earnings 
 record.</p>
<p style="margin-left: 36.00pt;">2. When the job is not an overhead job 
 AND the &#39;PRExpenseAccount&#39; registry entry is set, then the registry entry 
 specifies the GL Account to use.</p>
<p style="margin-left: 36.00pt;">3. When all else fails, the GL Expense 
 Account from the Cost Category is used.</p>
<p> In this case, a flag has been added to the Earnings record to 
 allow selection of specific N/A earnings to discount.</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: bold;">CIP 
 Discount?</span><br/>
 If this field is flagged and the Earnings Type is N/A, the CIP Discount 
 specified in the Job will be applied to this Earning record if the CIP 
 Discount field is also specified in the Job Cost Code record.</p>
<p style="margin-left: 48px;"><span style="font-weight: bold;">Upgrade 
 Note:</span> If CIP Discounts were implemented in Version 9.0, this box 
 MUST be flagged for the discounts to continue to be taken. <font style="font-weight: bold;">I</font>n 
 the original implementation, all N/A-type earnings were subject to CIP 
 Discounting.</p>
<p><font style="font-weight: bold;">Accrue?</font><br/>
If earnings of this type are to be accrued, check the Accrue box by double 
 clicking on it (or pressing Spacebar). If this box is checked, the GL 
 Credit Account <font style="text-decoration: underline; ">must</font> 
 be completed with the appropriate accrued payroll account.</p>
<p style="margin-left: 36.00pt;"><font style="font-weight: bold; text-decoration: underline; ">Wages</font> 
 <font style="font-weight: bold; text-decoration: underline; ">Example:</font></p>
<p style="margin-left: 36.00pt;">Pay period = Accrue to GL<br/>
Earnings Record<br/>
type = wages, Accrue to GL &amp; Job Cost Labor Entry boxes checked<br/>
      debit - cos<br/>
      credit - accrued P/R liab</p>
<p style="margin-left: 36.00pt;">The system will post the entry based on 
 the date WORKED to GL and to Job history.</p>
<p style="margin-left: 36.00pt;">When check is cut,  system will debit 
 the Accrued P/R liab - this is based on CHECK date.</p>
<p style="margin-left: 36.00pt;">So, if you work in Nov and pay in Dec, 
 the system will cost it to the Job &amp; GL in November (dr cos / cr accrued 
 PR Liab) and then reverse the accrual in Dec when check is posted  (dr 
 accrued PR Liab / cr cash).<br/>
<br/>
<font style="font-weight: bold; text-decoration: underline; ">Fringe Example:</font></p>
<p style="margin-left: 48px;"><font style="font-weight: bold; text-decoration: underline; ">Prior 
 to Version 9.0,</font> you could not accrue an Earnings ID marked Fringe 
 because it would be double-costed when Print/Post Payroll Checks was run. 
 This made it necessary to set up 2 Earnings Id&#39;s to book estimated fringes, 
 and then to make an adjustment at month or quarter end to &#39;adjust&#39; the 
 cost estimates to match the actual.</p>
<p style="margin-left: 48px;">In Version 9.0, Compute Payroll no longer 
 generates Fringe Expense and Liability GL activity for fringes that have 
 been accrued so that Fringe-type Earnings may be marked as Accrue. Note 
 that users who did not print/post Payroll checks were always allowed to 
 accrue the Fringes.</p>
<p style="margin-left: 88px;"><span style="font-weight: bold;">Note:</span><span> 
 Consult your Data-Basics Support Rep before changing any existing Fringe 
 Earnings to the new methodology.  The older setup shown below will 
 continue to work.</span></p>
<p style="margin-left: 72.00pt;">Earnings 1 - Estimated Fringe (or Burden)<br/>
      type = n/a ,  Accrue to GL, Job 
 Cost Labor Entry boxes checked<br/>
       debit - COS applied fringe (estimated)<br/>
       credit - pre-distributed fringe 
 G&amp;A expense  (system does not reverse this)<br/>
Earnings 2 - Actual Fringe<br/>
      type = fringe, no boxes checked<br/>
      debit - fringe expense (actual)<br/>
      credit - Union Benefits Fringe Liab<br/>
<br/>
Earnings 1 - posts to the Job and GLhistories with the date WORKED (if 
 Job = Overhead, posts to JCH, not GLH).<br/>
Earnings 2 - posts to the GL with CHECK DATE<br/>
<font style="font-weight: bold; font-style: italic;">An adjustment will 
 need to be done at month or quarter end to &#39;adjust&#39; the cost estimates 
 to match the actual.</font></p>
<p><font style="font-weight: bold;">Show Fringe on Check Stub:<br/>
Fringe on Check?</font><font style="font-weight: bold;"><br/>
</font>This field would typically only be used for Canadian Vacation Pay. 
 If the SAMPRO user wants the Vacation Benefit to appear as a &#39;fringe&#39; 
 on the PR Check, the Earnings record&#39;s &#39;Fringe on Check?&#39; option must 
 be set to True.  With this option On, the check will continue 
 to show the sum of the earnings as the hourly rate but it will also include 
 the amount paid for the Vacation Benefit in the Fringes section of the 
 check stub.  This means the user should also enter a value in 
 the Earnings record&#39;s Check Label field.</p>
<p style="margin-left: 36.00pt;"><font style="font-weight: bold;">Setup:</font> 
 Note that in the Earnings Record (for Canadian Vacation pay), the Type 
 would be set to Wage so that the employee has the amount added into each 
 hour&#39;s pay.  Typically, this would not be Job Costed.<br/>
<font style="font-weight: bold;">Employee Record or Earning Group:</font>  Verify 
 that the applicable Earnings is included in the Earnings list. By Canadian 
 law, the Amount is either 4 percent or 6 percent of wages.  The 
 Add Pay Rate Factor should be set to True. </p>
<p style="margin-left: 36.00pt;"><font style="font-weight: bold;">Reporting:</font> 
 It is important to note that in the case of a $10/hour wage rate and 4% 
 Vacation Benefit, the Regular Pay Rate is $10.40 as far as SAMPRO is concerned.  That 
 means all SAMPRO reports, including the PR Check, will show the rate as 
 $10.40.</p>
<p class="Tip_Note_Heading" style="margin-top: 4.00pt;">GL Debit 
 (Indirect)</p>
<p style="margin-left: 36.00pt;"><font style="font-weight: bold;">GL Account 
 Id:</font><br/>
The expense account earnings are going to when the Compute Payroll and 
 Post Payroll to GL functions are run 
 for Overhead Jobs. However, if the GL Expense Account in 
 the Pay Type record is filled in, the GL Account in the Pay Type record 
 will be used instead of the GL Debit (expense) account in the Earnings 
 record for the compute and post. In essence, the GL expense account in 
 the Pay Type record has precedence over the GL Debit (expense) account 
 in the Earnings record if both are filled in.</p>

 case of box 12, followed by a code) in the appropriate W-Category box. 
 Note that only those boxes that can be controlled by an Earnings or Deduction

  Assorted Wages and Fringes</p>
<p style="margin-left: 136px;">The software supports box 12 entries for 
 certain wages and<br/>
fringes that are are recorded to PR history.</p>
<p style="margin-left: 88px;">12:DD  Support for Employer Sponsored 
 Health Coverage</p>
<p style="margin-left: 136px;">This reporting requirement was introduced 
 by the 2010 Affordable Care Act. The idea is that reporting the cost of 
 healthcare will enable employees to be better informed about their healthcare 
 costs and the choices available to them. <font style="font-weight: bold;">For 
 2012 the reporting is required for employers filing more than 250 W-2s.</font> 
 The 250 limit may be reduced in the future but for the moment small employers 
 are not required to report the cost of healthcare coverage.</p>
<p style="margin-left: 136px;">SAMPro can handle this by treating the Employer 
 Sponsored Health Coverage as a non-taxable fringe and using the PR Adjustments 
 Journal to record the dollar amounts that are appropriate for each employee. 
 The applicable PR Adjustment entry should be made for each employee.  The 
 GL transactions would already have been made, the PR Adjustment entry 
 gets it on the W-2.  </p>
<p style="margin-left: 48px;"> 14:label The preferred functionality 
 for Box 14 is implemented by entering SDI</p>
<p style="margin-left: 136px;">in the Tax Table User 1field (or Tax Authority 
 User 1 Field). This overrides its implementation in an Earnings or Deduction 
 record.</p>
<p style="margin-left: 56px; font-weight: bold;

 Entries:</p>
<p style="margin-left: 48px;">Earnings 
 records may be set up with a W2 Category of OI:40 and an Earnings 
 Type of Wage for use in T4 processing.</p>
<p style="margin-left: 48px;">Canadian 
 T4&#39;s use the W2 Category fields in the Deductions &amp; Earnings records 
 to populate the Other Information boxes on the T4. The W2 category must 
 be filled in as OI:(Code # for T4). The Employee User 7 field is used 
 to print the registration number in box 50 on the T4.</p>
<p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"> </p>
<p><font style="font-weight: bold;">Earnings  <span>User1-5 (1-2 for 
 Version 9.0):</span></font><br/>
These optional fields may be used for entering any information your company 
 wishes to retain (e.g., additional account numbers) or other special processing.</p>
<p><span>See <a href="Registry_Entry_for_Taxable_Fringe_Benefits.htm">Registry 
 Compute Payroll</a> for an option to specify exceptions to Taxable Fringes 
 via 1 or User2 fields. If enabled via registry these fields may be used 
 to specify a list of Tax Groups or Tax Authorities for which tax should 
 NOT be assessed if enabled via the above registry setting:</span></p>
<p style="margin-left: 48px;">If the Earning Record is of Type Fringe, 
 with the Taxable box checked AND  </p>
<p style="margin-left: 48px;">The FringeTaxExceptionsUser1 or FringeTaxExceptionsUser2 
 registries are set AND</p>
<p style="margin-left: 48px;"><span>The Tax Table is specified as &#39;Always 
 Withhold&#39; on the Employee&#39;s taxes tab. </span></p>
<p style="margin-left: 48px; font-weight: bold;">Earnings 
 User2: Alternate W2 12:DD (HSA Employer Costs) Processing<br/>
 <span style="font-weight: normal;">Some users wish to set up an Earnings 
 Id to process W2 12:DD (HSA Employer Costs) and include this 
 Earnings Id in regular PR processing. This procedure populated both prhstryernngs_amnt_ernngs 
 &amp; prhstryernngs_amnt_fringe fields. The W2 report sums (prhstryernngs_amnt_ernngs 
 + prhstryernngs_amnt_fringe) which is cause the amount in box 12:DD to 
 be overstated.  NOTE: This processing does not follow the instructions 
 in the Data-Basics EOY document.</span> </p>
<p style="margin-left: 48px;">Setting 
 the Earning record&#39;s User2 field to a value of FringeOnlyW2 changes the 
 default behavior to only include prhstryernngs_amnt_frnge in the calculation 
 for specific earnings on W2&#39;s which corrects the overstatement. </p>
<p><font style="font-weight: bold;">Security Id:</font><br/>
If multiple location security is implemented on your centralized database 
 system, this informational field displays the Security Id of the local 
 user that created this record. If multiple location security is not implemented 
 on your system, or if this record was created by a global user, this field 
 will be blank.</p>
