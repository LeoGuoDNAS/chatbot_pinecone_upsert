  <h1>Work Order Inventory Tab</h1>
  <h2>Purpose:</h2>
  <p>Specifies the units, description, costs and prices of the inventory materials applied to this Work Order.</p>
  <h2>Example:</h2>
  <p>1 Acme 254356X compressor.</p>
  <h2>Usage:</h2>
  <p>SAM Pro validation ensures that an accounting period is specified for all Work Order Inventory lines that are not flagged as quotes or were imported from job history. If Default Accounting Period is specified, it will be used when the user enters Inventory Tab lines.</p>
  
  
  
  
  
  
  <p>Non-inventory material should be entered on the Other tab. Inventory materials entered and received on a Purchase Order are committed to this Work Order but should be imported to this tab to be allocated; doing so completes the transfer out of (On Hand) inventory. Items entered in the Job Journal will not appear on the Work Order Inventory screen unless you implement click the Import Costs button, but will be included in job history for costing and invoicing purposes.</p>
  <p style="margin-left: 36.00pt;">
    <font style="font-weight: bold;">Deleting Inventory Lines if</font>
    <font style="font-weight: bold;">the</font>
    <font style="font-weight: bold;">Accounting Period is Inactive</font>
  </p>
  <p style="margin-left: 36.00pt;">In previous releases, although the user had to change the Accounting Period Id to an active one before deleting a WO Inventory line, the system posted the reversal to the Inactive period. The code has been changed to prevent this. The appropriate process for &#39;deleting&#39; with closed period lines is to:</p>
  <p style="margin-left: 66.25pt;">a) Switch to an active period (use the Magnify button to access this field) and zero out the quantity. </p>
  <p style="margin-left: 66.25pt;">b) Save the WO with an active period.</p>
  <p style="margin-left: 66.25pt;">c) Delete the line and re-save the record. </p>
  <p style="margin-left: 36.00pt;">When posting occurs, the reversing entries will use the new period and effective dates. </p>
  <p>
    <font style="font-weight: bold;">Posting to GL</font>
  </p>
  <p>This release changes the behavior when posting WO-INV entries to GL History.  Previously, the GLH Credit never included a GL Entity.  In this release, the system ALWAYS uses the GL Entity from the WO-INV line&#39;s Location record. Set the GL Entity in the Location record to ensure that the Credit GL Entity defaults properly when items are entered on the Work Order Inventory tab.</p>
  <p>The posting of Inventory to GL uses the inventory group&#39;s expense account (if available), otherwise it posts to the WIP account.</p>
  <p style="text-indent: 5.75pt;">Quote-type lines no longer post to GL since they never become Actual Job Costs.</p>
  <p style="text-indent: 5.75pt;">
    <font style="font-weight: bold;">Quote Box Validation</font>
  </p>
  <p style="text-indent: 5.75pt;">This validation applies to lines that are <font style="text-decoration: underline; ">not</font> associated with a Quote: it prevents an &#39;actual&#39; line (that has already been saved into the database) from being switched to a Quote-type line. Note that the Quote box of Work Orders associated with a Quote still cannot be changed at all.</p>
  <h2>Important Fields:</h2>
  <p><img alt="" border="0" src="assets/images/image/Magnify.gif" style="border: none;"/> Double-click the Magnify button to display all fields for this line.</p>
  <p class="Reference_Line" style="margin-bottom: 0.00pt;"><img alt="" border="0" src="assets/images/image/LinesView.gif" style="border: none;"/>  Click the Lines View button to display the multiple line view again.</p>
  <p>
    <font style="font-weight: bold;">Qu (Quote?)</font><br/>
    If this line represents an estimate for work you are quoting a customer, check this box by double-clicking it (or press the spacebar when the caret is on it). If the quote is approved, the system will ultimately use the Quote lines to generate billable revenue and budgeted costs. When you check the Quote box, the Extra box will automatically be flagged.
  </p>
  <p>As the work for this quote is completed, the actual quantities should be recorded on lines that are <font style="font-weight: bold;">not</font> flagged as Quotes: these costs will be written to Job History. Billable revenue should only be included on these lines if it represents additional billable dollars not included in the original quote.</p>
  <p>Flag the Work Order as Invoice Ready when it has been approved and you are ready to bill it.</p>
  <p style="margin-left: 36.00pt;">
    <font style="font-weight: bold;">PM Work Orders – JCH Budgets</font><br/>
    This <a href="Registry_Entry_to_Warn_if_Cost_Code_Requires_Certified_PR_Reporting.htm#registry_workorder_disable_budget_posting">registry option</a> will disable the posting of job history of budget cost and budget revenue for Preventive Maintenance work orders where the work order lines are marked QU.
  </p>
  <p>
    <font style="font-weight: bold;">Extra?</font><br/>
    If this line references is a Fixed Fee Job Billing Item, and if this is an &quot;extra&quot; that can be billed for, check this box by double-clicking or pressing the Spacebar. <font style="font-weight: bold;">Note that this Box can only be checked if the Job Billing Item you selected allows extras.</font> The Revenue Rate, Unit Price, and Amnt Revenue fields will not be completed unless an Item is marked as an Extra. Items that are not Extras will be used to calculate job costing and profitability, but will not be invoiced for directly.
  </p>
  <p>
    <font style="font-weight: bold;">Effective Date:</font><br/>
    Generally, the date on which the inventory was actually used. Use the <font style="font-style: italic;">MMDDYYYY</font> format to enter the date from the keyboard or double-click on this field (or press Alt+F7) to access the Calendar viewer. Press Spacebar to enter today&#39;s date. When the Effective Date is filled in and you then enter an Inventory Item Id, the Unit Price will default from the Inventory Item record (if the part is marked Used Unit Pricing); if corresponding Price Codes are entered in the Client Site and Inventory Item Pricing tab, exception pricing will be used. If Use Unit Pricing is not flagged, it will be marked up according to the Material Rate Table specified in the Job Record&#39;s Rate Schedule using the date information.
  </p>
  <p style="margin-left: 48px;"><span style="font-weight: bold;">Lines from Quote Manager:</span><span> When the Work Order is set to Invoice Ready and saved, the Effective Date of Quoted lines and Revenue Adjustments from Quote Manager will be updated to the Work Order Date Work Completed (if set). In previous releases, the Effective Date of these lines was set to the origination date of the Quote. Since this date could be months in the past, revenue was recognized way too early through the Job EOM function. See <a href="Quoted_and_Rev_Adjustment_Line_Dates.htm">Quote and Rev Adjust Lines</a> for details.</span></p>
  <p>
    <font style="font-weight: bold;">Equipment Id:</font><br/>
    If only one piece of equipment is included on the Equipment tab, it will default to this line. If more than one piece of Equipment is listed on the Equipment tab, enter the appropriate Equipment Id or double-click to select from a list. Note that only Equipment Id&#39;s included on the Equipment tab will appear on the list.
  </p>
  <p>
    <font style="font-weight: bold;">Quantity: Qty Billed:</font><br/>
    The Actual (Used) and Billable Quantities may be specified separately. The Quantity Used will be used for costing, and the Quantity Billed will be used to compute revenue for billing purposes. Note that the Quantity Billed field defaults when you enter the Quantity Used, but may be adjusted by the user if needed. This enables you to enter a single line of inventory to account for a situation where a technician used 4 widgets on a job, but you only wished to bill the customer for 3 of them.
  </p>
  <p>
    <font style="font-weight: bold;">Inventory Item Id:</font>
    <font style="font-weight: bold;">Inventory Item Name:</font><br/>
    Enter a valid Inventory Item Id or double-click on this field (or press Alt+F7) to select from a list of Inventory items. The Unit of Measure and Inventory Item Name will be filled in when an Item Id is selected.
  </p>
  <p>The system now checks to see if a part has been superceded (the Superceded By field on the Inventory Other Tab is filled in). When a superseded part number is entered into this field, the system will alert the user that</p>
  <p style="margin-left: 36.00pt;">Item A has been superceded by Item B. Use New Item?</p>
  <p>It the user clicks Yes, the new part (B) will be returned to the field. If the user clicks No, part A (which has been superceded) will remain in the field.</p>
  <p>
    <font style="font-weight: bold;">Price Level (L)</font><br/>
    If the Inventory Item is flagged as <span>&#39;Use Price Levels&#39;,</span> this field will be used to determine which Price Level to use for the Unit Price field. The price level can be set on an item-by-item basis, but it defaults from the Client Site record (unless overridden by the Price Level specified in the Job record) . This field is also used in conjunction with Pricing Codes: see <a href="Price_Code_Viewer.htm">Price Code Viewer</a> for details. <span>When the both Job &amp; Site Levels are both blank use the Work Order Price Level which defaults to 1 in this scenario.</span>
  </p>
  <p style="margin-left: 36.00pt;">
    <font style="font-weight: bold;">Price Code Handling:</font><br/>
    The Inventory Item allows for 10 levels of Material Pricing, but Price Codes only allow for 5. If price codes are in effect, and the default price level from the Job is greater than 5, the system now defaults price level 1 from the Price Code. A registry entry <a href="Registry_Entry_Global_Settings__Column_Compression__Dispatch_Board_Rows__History_Log_Inventory_Markup.htm#globel_settings_price_code">Price Code Handling (sys-ffv-global-settings)</a> is available to always default the value from the Price Code level 1, regardless of the Material Price Level in the Job.
  </p>
  <p>
    <font style="font-weight: bold;">Unit Cost:</font><br/>
    The Unit Cost of the inventory material. This number defaults from the Unit Cost field (Last, Average or Standard) as specified in the Inventory Item record, but may be adjusted by the user if needed. If the Last or Average cost is specified, the Unit Cost, if available, will default from the Inventory Item&#39;s Location tab.
  </p>
  <p>
    <font style="font-weight: bold;">Amount Cost:</font><br/>
    The Unit Cost times the Quantity.
  </p>
  <p>
    <font style="font-weight: bold;">Serial/Lot Id:</font><br/>
    If this item is serialized or lot controlled, enter the appropriate serial or lot control number. If this item was imported from a PO, the serial number entered in the Receipts Journal will appear. For lot-controlled items, the number generated by SAM Pro will appear. Note that when you click on the Serial/Lot field to select from a list of Lot numbers, the InventoryItemSerializedbyIdbyItem sort order displays the Vendor’s Lot number.
  </p>
  <p style="margin-left: 36.00pt;">
    <font style="font-weight: bold;">Note:</font>
    <font style="font-weight: bold;">Managing Serialized Items</font><br/>
    If a serialized item entered directly on Work Order A by mistake, the process should be to remove it from Work Order A.  That puts it back into stock and there is no need for the IM Adjustment entry.
  </p>
  <p style="margin-left: 36.00pt;">However, if the part was &#39;used&#39; on A (e.g., rental equipment) and is going back into stock so it can later be used on B, it should still appear on A as far as being a chargeable cost with/without associated revenue.  In this case, returning it stock would be done with the Inventory Adjustments Journal.</p>
  <p style="margin-left: 36.00pt;">
    <font style="font-weight: bold;">Serialized Inventory</font>
    <font style="font-weight: bold;">Imported from PO’s</font>
    <font style="font-weight: bold;">:</font> A serialized item may be &#39;removed&#39; from the work order by adding a -1.00 serialized WO-INV line with the Serial number already in the current WO-INV list. The serialized item is returned to stock in the location specified in the negative line.
  </p>
  <p style="margin-left: 36.00pt;">You cannot remove an imported serialized WO-INV item from another work order with this method. If you attempt to do so, the following message will appear: “A Quantity of -1 should only be used to reverse a serialized item that has been imported to this work order.”</p>
  <p>
    <font style="font-weight: bold;">Cost Category Id:</font><br/>
    A valid Cost Category with the Cost Type set to Material <span>or Equipment</span>. When you double-click on this field, the list will be filtered so that only those Job Cost Categories will be displayed.
  </p>
  <p style="margin-left: 36.00pt;">
    <font style="font-weight: bold;">Note:</font> If edits are made to work order detail lines AFTER a change has been made to the Posting Type of the Cost Category, updates to JCH will use the <font style="text-decoration: underline; ">original Cost Type</font>.  For example, if a cost type was changed from Material to Other, the changed amounts continue to be classified as Other.
  </p>
  <p style="margin-left: 8px;"><span>This field supports enhanced filtering provided by the Cost Code&#39;s Job Cost Category Usage Filter. Cost Categories are validated (relative to Cost Codes) during data entry upon leaving the Cost Category Id field.  The full relationship is validated again when leaving a child line or saving a record.</span></p>
  <p style="margin-left: 8px;">For COP, the Inventory Groups must include a Job Cost Category with an Avalara code of NT if items in the group are to be non-taxed.  By default, if no Job Cost Category exists in the Inventory Group, all items will be taxed.</p>
  <p>
    <font style="font-weight: bold;">Billing Type Id:  Revenue Rate:</font><br/>
    These fields are jointly determined by the Inventory Item record and the Rate Schedule for this Job, but may be changed if needed. These fields determine how the Unit Price of the item will be calculated:
  </p>
  <p style="margin-left: 36.00pt;">For <span>Use Price Levels</span> Inventory Items, the Billing Type Id will default to <font style="font-weight: bold;">Unit Price</font>, the system will use the Unit Price in the Inventory Item record that applies to the Price Level (L) specified on this line. In this case, the Revenue Rate will equal the Unit Price.</p>
  <p style="margin-left: 36.00pt;"><span>If the default markup methodology is in effect this field will also be set to Unit Price because the price calculation is the result of an aggregate calculation. If the old markup methodology is in effect this field will be set to the applicable value (margin, markup or multiplier).</span></p>
  <p><span style="font-weight: bold;">UOM:</span><br/>
    Displays the Unit of Measure from the Inventory record.</p>
  <p>
    <font style="font-weight: bold;">Unit Price:</font><br/>
    The Unit Price for this inventory item, based on the Unit Cost, Bill Type Id, and Revenue rate.
  </p>
  <p>
    <font style="font-weight: bold;">Amnt Revenue:</font><br/>
    The price that will appear on the invoice (Unit Price x Quantity), less any applicable discounts.
  </p>
  <p>
    <font style="font-weight: bold;">Location Id:</font><br/>
    The location this item was taken from. This field defaults from the Location on the Work Order’s Main tab.
  </p>
  <p>
    <font style="font-weight: bold;">Flat Rate Category Id:</font><br/>
    If this line was created by the system when a Flat Rate was imported, this field will be filled in. It is used to associate flat rates with inventory costs (from the Flat Rate category) for reporting purposes.
  </p>
  <p>
    <font style="font-weight: bold;">Period Id:</font><br/>
    By default, the system will enter the default accounting period for you (if one exists). Enter the Accounting Period to be charged with the inventory transfer. Note that the GL Inventory Asset Account (in the Inventory Group Record) will be credited, and the GL WIP Account (in the Inventory Group Record) will be debited. The Effective Date must fall within the Accounting Period. Enter a valid Id or double-click on this field to select from a list.
  </p>
  <p>The system validates that the accounting period is in fact &quot;active&quot;, when Inventory is added to WO&#39;s.  It is necessary to perform this validation if there is going to be an impact on the G/L, which occurs when the &quot;WO Inventory to GL&quot; option is selected in an accounting period.</p>
  <p>When you attempt to Add, Delete, or Insert a line, the system will also verify that the accounting period is active if it’s <font style="font-weight: bold;">WO Inventory to GL</font> flag is checked. Note that the system will only post GL transactions for Inventory entered on Work Orders if this flag <font style="font-weight: bold;">and</font> the Enable GL History flags are checked.</p>
  <p style="margin-left: 36.00pt;">
    <font style="font-weight: bold;">Deleting Inventory Lines if</font>
    <font style="font-weight: bold;">the</font>
    <font style="font-weight: bold;">Accounting Period is Inactive</font>
  </p>
  <p style="margin-left: 36.00pt;">In previous releases, although the user had to change the Accounting Period Id to an active one before deleting a WO Inventory line, the system posted the reversal to the Inactive period. The code has been changed to prevent this. The appropriate process for &#39;deleting&#39; with closed period lines is to:</p>
  <p style="margin-left: 66.25pt;">a) Switch to an active period (use the Magnify button to access this field) and zero out the quantity. </p>
  <p style="margin-left: 66.25pt;">b) Save the WO with an active period.</p>
  <p style="margin-left: 66.25pt;">c) Delete the line and re-save the record. </p>
  <p style="text-indent: 30.25pt;">When posting occurs, the reversing entries will use the new period and effective dates. </p>
  <p>
    <font style="font-weight: bold;">Job Id:</font><br/>
    This field defaults from the Work Order Main tab unless a registry entry is in place to default it from the Equipment record.
  </p>
  <p>
    <font style="font-weight: bold;">Job Cost Code Id:</font><br/>
    This field defaults from the Work Order main screen. You may double-click on this field to select from a list of Job Cost Codes for this Job.
  </p>
  <p>
    <font style="font-weight: bold;">Job Billing Item Id:</font><br/>
    This field defaults from the Job Cost Code record. You may double-click on this field to select from a list of Billing Items for this Job.
  </p>
  <p>
    <font style="font-weight: bold;">GL Entity:</font><br/>
    The GL Entity defaults as follows: First from the Job Cost Code, next from the Location, last from the Inventory Group. <span>When Intercompany is enabled any changes to the line&#39;s GL Entity are validated to ensure that the new GL Entity belongs to the same company as the Job.</span>
  </p>
  <p>This release changes the behavior when posting WO-INV entries to GL History.  Previously, the GLH Credit never included a GL Entity.  In this release, the system ALWAYS uses the GL Entity from the WO-INV line&#39;s Location record. Set the GL Entity in the Location record to ensure that the Credit GL Entity defaults properly when items are entered on the Work Order Inventory tab.</p>
  <p><img alt="image\magnifybutton.gif" border="0" height="16" src="assets/images/image/magnifybutton.gif" title="image\magnifybutton.gif" width="16"/>
    <font style="font-weight: bold;">Click the Magnify button to view the following fields:</font>
  </p>
  <p>
    <font style="font-weight: bold;">Description:</font><br/>
    This optional field may be used to enter a brief description of this item.
  </p>
  <p>If applicable to this item, the system now sets this field the Price Code and the Inventory Price Exceptions tables (shown on the Inventory Item Pricing tab). This description prints on several of the invoice formats.</p>
  <p>
    <font style="font-weight: bold;">PO Id:</font><br/>
    If this line was generated by importing a Purchase Order, the Purchase Order Id will appear in this display-only field.
  </p>
  <p>
    <font style="font-weight: bold;">Imported From JCH:</font><br/>
    This box will be checked if this line was imported from Job Cost History (e.g., a Purchase Order) rather than being entered directly on the work order.
  </p>
  <p>
    <font style="font-weight: bold;">Computed:</font><br/>
    This display-only field is maintained by the system.
  </p>
  <p>
    <font style="font-weight: bold;">Closed Period Entry?</font><br/>
    The software saves the Accounting Period&#39;s status for each line on the INV tab as the WO is loaded into the viewer.  If this field is checked, you must change to an active accounting period (and appropriate effective date) before attempting to delete this line.
  </p>
  <p><span style="font-weight: bold;">TechAnywhere Source Rn: Technician Id:</span><br/>
    If these fields are completed, this record/line was created/revised from TechAnywhere.</p>
