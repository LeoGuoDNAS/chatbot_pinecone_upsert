  <h1>Client Site Equipment Viewer</h1>
  <h2>Purpose:</h2>
  <p>Contains the detailed record of the equipment at a specific client site.</p>
  <h2>Example:</h2>
  <p>Suppose that a client site includes two major pieces of equipment; a boiler and an air conditioner. In this example, two Client Site Equipment records would be created - one for the boiler and one for the air conditioner.</p>
  <h2>Usage:</h2>
  <p>A Client Site Equipment record can only be created for a valid Client Site. A Client Site Equipment Record is required in order to set up Client Site Equipment PM records, and to track equipment history.</p>
  <p>Site Equipment records that are attached to Client Site Template records may only be edited by users with access to Templates via their User Groups.</p>
  <p>Equipment records associated with Assets may be created to implement rental equipment billing.</p>
  <h2>Registry:</h2>
  <p><a href="Registry_Client_Site_Equipment_Viewer.htm">Client Site Equipment Registry</a></p>
  <p>Registries to <a href="Interest_Registry_Entry_Set_Disabled_Fields.htm">Set Disabled Fields</a> and <a href="Internal_Registry_Set_Required_Fields.htm">Set Required Fields</a>.</p>
  <h2>Screen Organization:</h2>
  <p>The tabs in the upper section of this screen organize the primary site equipment information. Click on the following links to see additional information on each tab.</p>
  <p><a href="#Client_Site_Equipment_Main_Tab">Main Tab</a>  <a href="#Client_Site_Equipment_Service_Tab">Service Tab</a>  <a href="#Client_Site_Equipment_User_Fields_Tab">User Fields Tab</a></p>
  <p>The tabs on the lower section of this screen display the site equipment &#39;child&#39; tables. Click on the following links to see additional information:</p>
  <p><a href="Client_Site_Equipment_PM_Tab.htm">PM Schedule Tab</a>  <a href="Client_Site_Equipment_COM__Component__Tab.htm">Components Tab</a>  <a href="Site_Equipment_Certification_Tab.htm">Certifications Tab</a>  <a href="Client_Site_Equipment_Active_Equipment_Tab.htm">Active Equipment Tab</a> <a href="Client_Site_Equipement_Open_WOs_Tab.htm">Open WOs Tab</a>  <a href="Client_Site_Equipment_Other_WOs_Tab.htm">Other WOs Tab</a> <a href="Client_Site_Equipment_MasterSchedule_Tab.htm">MasterSchedule Tab</a> <a href="Client_Site_Equipment_Metric_History_Tab.htm">Metric History Tab</a></p>
  <p><img alt="" border="0" src="assets/images/SKIN1_PMClone.bmp" style="border: none;"/> Clicking this button enables you to clone the PM Schedule from another Equipment record. When you click this button a list of equipment records who’s PM Schedules are eligible to be copied will appear. By default, equipment will only appear on this list if they contain lines that are not associated with a master contact, regardless of whether or not an a work order is associated with it (a registry setting is available to limit eligible lines to those without work orders).</p>
  <p>When you select a record from the list and click ‘ok’, its PM Schedule entries will be copied to the current PM Schedule tab. Adjust these lines as needed before saving the record.</p>

If the selected Equipment has NOT been tagged as replaced, these fields well be blank.</span>
  </p>
  <p>When a TechAnywhere Tech decides to replace equipment (Ex. RTU-1), the following will happen as the Replacement Procedure is implemented during the TechAnywhere Post:</p>
  <p style="margin-left: 48px;">Rename original Equipment record from RTU-1 to RTU-1-R</p>
  <p style="margin-left: 48px;">If RTU-1-R already exists (was replaced in the past), use RTU-1-R2, RTU-1-R3 and so on. Note we skipped &#39;R1&#39; as it makes more sense to do so.</p>
  <p style="margin-left: 48px;">Set the Replacement Equipment Field to link the new RTU-1 equipment to be created soon after.</p>
  <p style="margin-left: 48px;">Set the Date Replaced with the current date.</p>
  <p style="margin-left: 48px;">Set the Deny TA Access flag to Yes, so the old equipment is no longer accessible from TechAnywhere.</p>
  <p style="margin-left: 48px;">The New replacement equipment will be submitted when the technician completes the work order. The new equipment will have the same ID as the original, RTU-1.</p>
