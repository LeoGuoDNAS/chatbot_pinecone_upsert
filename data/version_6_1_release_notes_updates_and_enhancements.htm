<H1>Data-Basics Software Support Services</H1>
 <H2>SAM Pro Enterprise Software</H2>
 <H2>Version 6.1 Release Notes - Build 6.1.358.070</H2>
 <P><A href="version_6_1_release_notes_updates_and_enhancements.htm#6.1_Patches">Link to Patches by Build - Version 6.1</A> </P>
 <H1>1  System</H1>
 <H2>About This Product Window – Report Id and Revision Level</H2>
 <P>If you select the Help menu and choose the About this Product option from a UD Report window, the Report Id and Revision Level of the report will be displayed.  Note that system (Smalltalk) reports do not contain this information. </P>
 <H2>1.2 E-mail </H2>
 <H3>1.2.1 Authentication</H3>
 <P>SAM Pro’s SMTP mechanism now includes an Authentication mechanism for mail servers providing LOGIN authentication. See section 2.3 of these release notes for the registry entries that support this feature and additional information regarding it. </P>
 <H3>1.2.2 Support for Outlook</H3>
 <P>Enhanced support for Outlook (not Outlook Express) has been added to Version 6.1.  This is implemented by creating the sys-email registry option UseOutlook=true discussed in section 2.3.  All your SAM Pro users <FONT style="font-weight:bold; " >must</FONT> be running MS Outlook. </P>
 <P>When Outlook is implemented, the following will occur when you click the E-mail button on a SAM Pro report:</P>
 <P>The Outlook e-mail form (not SAM Pro’s) will open.</P>
 <P>The report that you generated will be attached in its default PDF format (or as set in the registry).</P>
 <P>The From: line will be completed with the e-mail address from your Outlook profile.</P>
 <P>The To: line will be completed with the default values (if any) that exist for this report.</P>
 <P>The Subject line will be defaulted according to the report.</P>
 <P>When the Outlook form is up, you may add additional recipients from your Outlook address box, enter a text message, and include additional attachments.  When you click Send, a copy of the e-mail will remain in your Sent box if you have implemented this feature in Outlook. </P>
 <H3>1.2.3 Text Reports included in the Body of E-mail</H3>
 <P>All outbound SAMPRO e-mails that have text-file attachments generated by the system will now be sent with the text-file contents embedded in the email message body.&nbsp; This makes attaching the text-file obsolete.&nbsp; </P>
 <H2>1.3 User Record</H2>
 <H6>New Fields</H6>
 <P><FONT style="font-weight:bold; " >Drop Ship Agent:<BR></FONT>Check this box (by pressing the spacebar or double-click it) if this user is authorized to flag Client Orders for drop shipment. </P>
 <P><FONT style="font-weight:bold; " >Location Filter:<BR></FONT>Reserved for future use. </P>
 <H2>1.4 ReportAnywhere</H2>
 <H3>1.4.1 Custom Date Strategies</H3>
 <P>ReportAnywhere supports relative dates for report scheduling. This enables you to set report dates (such as the Beginning Date, End Date, Statement Date, etc.) <FONT style="text-decoration:underline;" >relative to the run date</FONT> of the report. </P>
 <P><FONT style="font-weight:bold; " >Note:</FONT> Relative dates should <FONT style="text-decoration:underline;" >not</FONT> apply to the &quot;run date&quot;, as &quot;repeat options&quot; handle that.</P>
 <P class="Body_Text_Indent_3" style="margin-top:0.00pt;margin-bottom:0.00pt;">&nbsp;</P>
 <P>To enter a relative date on the report you are scheduling, <FONT style="font-weight:bold; " >right mouse click</FONT> in the desired date field. When you do so, a date selection box will appear:</P>
 <P class="Body_Text_Indent_3" style="margin-top:0.00pt;margin-bottom:0.00pt;">&nbsp;</P>
 <P class="Body_Text_Indent_3" style="margin-top:0.00pt;margin-bottom:0.00pt;"><IMG src="images/reportdate031.gif" border=0 height=357 width=426 alt="images\reportdate031.gif"> </P>
 <P class="Body_Text_Indent_3" style="margin-top:0.00pt;margin-bottom:0.00pt;">&nbsp;</P>
 <P>The custom strategy box enables you to set the report dates based on the date the report is run by the system according to the following rules:</P>
 <P class="Normal_Indent" ><FONT style="font-weight:bold; " >d</FONT>, <FONT style="font-weight:bold; " >m</FONT> and <FONT style="font-weight:bold; " >y</FONT> refer to the day, month and year of the current run date.</P>
 <P class="Normal_Indent" >Each date component can be controlled separately.</P>
 <P class="Normal_Indent" >Adjustments can be either relative (using + or&nbsp;-) or absolute (no sign).</P>
 <P class="Normal_Indent" ><FONT style="font-weight:bold; " >d=last</FONT> is a special case to compensate for the variable # of days in a month.</P>
 <P class="Normal_Indent" >Omitting a date component is the equivalent saying 'date component=+0'&nbsp; (i.e. today--&gt;d=+0)</P>
 <P>&nbsp;&nbsp;A semi-colon must separate date components</P>
 <P>Example:</P>
 <P>Suppose you are scheduling the report to run every Sunday. To set the BEGIN DATE of the report to Monday, you could either select the &quot;Tomorrow&quot; option, or use custom strategy <FONT style="font-weight:bold; " >d=+1</FONT> (i.e. Monday).  To set the end date to Wednesday, use the custom strategy <FONT style="font-weight:bold; " >d=+3</FONT> (i.e. Wednesday). The custom option enables a greater degree of flexibility </P>
 <P class="Block_Text" >The following is a list of custom date strategy syntax and conventions.</P>
 <P class="Block_Text" >&nbsp;<FONT style="font-weight:bold; " >Option&nbsp;&nbsp;Custom &nbsp;&nbsp;</FONT></P>
 <P class="Normal_Indent" >Yesterday&nbsp;<FONT style="font-weight:bold; " >d=-1 </FONT></P>
 <P class="Normal_Indent" >Today&nbsp;&nbsp;<FONT style="font-weight:bold; " >d=+0</FONT></P>
 <P class="Normal_Indent" >Tomorrow&nbsp;<FONT style="font-weight:bold; " >d=+1</FONT></P>
 <P class="Normal_Indent" >PrevMMFirstDD&nbsp;<FONT style="font-weight:bold; " >m=-1;d=1</FONT> &nbsp;&nbsp;(first day of the previous month)</P>
 <P class="Normal_Indent" >PrevMMLastDD&nbsp;<FONT style="font-weight:bold; " >m=-1;d=last</FONT> &nbsp;&nbsp;(last day of the previous month)</P>
 <P class="Normal_Indent" >ThisMMFirstDD&nbsp;<FONT style="font-weight:bold; " >d=1</FONT> &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;(first day of this month)</P>
 <P class="Normal_Indent" >&nbsp;&nbsp;<FONT style="font-weight:bold; " >d=15 &nbsp;</FONT>&nbsp;&nbsp;(the fifteenth of this month)</P>
 <P class="Normal_Indent" >ThisMMLastDD&nbsp;<FONT style="font-weight:bold; " >d=last</FONT> &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;(the last day of this month)</P>
 <P class="Normal_Indent" >NextMMFirstDD&nbsp;<FONT style="font-weight:bold; " >m=+1;d=1</FONT>&nbsp;&nbsp;(first day of next month)</P>
 <P class="Normal_Indent" >NextMMLastDD&nbsp;&nbsp;<FONT style="font-weight:bold; " >m=+1;d=last</FONT>&nbsp;&nbsp;(last day of next month)</P>
 <P class="Normal_Indent" >PrevYYFirstDD&nbsp;<FONT style="font-weight:bold; " >y=-1;m=1;d=1</FONT>&nbsp;&nbsp;(first day of last year)</P>
 <P class="Normal_Indent" >PrevYYLastDD&nbsp;<FONT style="font-weight:bold; " >y=-1;m=12;d=last</FONT>&nbsp;(last day of last year)</P>
 <P class="Normal_Indent" >ThisYYFirstDD&nbsp;<FONT style="font-weight:bold; " >m=1;d=1&nbsp;&nbsp;</FONT>(first day of this year)</P>
 <P class="Normal_Indent" >&nbsp;&nbsp;<FONT style="font-weight:bold; " >m=3;d=31</FONT>&nbsp;&nbsp;(end of first quarter, this year)</P>
 <P class="Normal_Indent" >ThisYYLastDD&nbsp;<FONT style="font-weight:bold; " >m=12;d=31&nbsp;&nbsp;</FONT>(last day of this year)</P>
 <P class="Normal_Indent" >NextYYFirstDD&nbsp;<FONT style="font-weight:bold; " >y=+1;m=1;d=1</FONT>&nbsp;&nbsp;(first day of next year)</P>
 <P class="Normal_Indent" >NextYYLastDD&nbsp;<FONT style="font-weight:bold; " >y=+1;m=12;d=last</FONT>&nbsp;(last day of next year)</P>
 <H3>1.4.2 Scheduled Reports </H3>
 <P><FONT style="font-weight:bold; " >File Option:<BR>Save Report as:  PDF  DBReport&nbsp;&nbsp;HTML&nbsp;Text &nbsp;CSV<BR></FONT>If text is selected, the report’s<FONT style="font-weight:bold; " > </FONT>text-file contents will be embedded in the e-mail’s message body rather than being included as an e-mail attachment. &nbsp; </P>
 <H2>1.5 General Performance Enhancements</H2>
 <P>For Sybase users, the ODBC connection method has been changed from ‘connect’ to ‘driverConnect’ to  allow the specification of connection parameters to improve performance.&nbsp;</P>
 <P>For all users, performance enhancements have been made to the methods of opening of opening viewers in general. </P>
 <H2>1.5.1 GL History Performance Enhancement</H2>
 <P>The glhstry table needs an index so that Currency Adjustment queries do not need to pass sequentially through the table.&nbsp; The AP Check Post, AP Journal, Cash Receipts Journal, Sales Journal and PO viewers suffer the most from the missing index. For existing v6.1 users, the simplest way to insert the index is to run the starter function named 'Start MS Access ODBC Setup'.   </P>
 <H2>1.6 Switching User Security</H2>
 <P>The ability for users to ‘Switch Security’ Id has been added to the pull-down menu to provide simple access to the security switch with minimal keystrokes. In most cases, this function is accessed by selecting Functions-Utilities-Special-Switch Security Id from the pull-down menu. </P>
 <H2>1.7 Report Viewer: Collated / Non-collated Printing</H2>
 <P><FONT style="font-weight:bold; " >Collate<BR></FONT>This box controls the sequence in which multiple copies are printed.  By default, this box is checked so that<FONT style="font-weight:bold; " > </FONT>multiple copies of a report would be sequenced as follows: </P>
 <P>p1 p2 p3 p1 p2 p3 etc.</P>
 <P>Clearing this box will result in non-collated printing:</P>
 <P>p1 p1 p2 p2 p3 p3<BR><BR>This non-collated version enables users to easily print multiple-part copies of invoices and other reports on collated colored laser paper.  The number of copies should be set to the number of colors in the collated paper. Be sure that the multi-color paper is loaded in the printed, and that the correct drawer is selected. </P>
 <H2>1.8 Clear Checks Viewer </H2>
 <P>Two new buttons have been added to the checklist screen. They function as follows:</P>
 <P><IMG src="images/check.gif" border="0" height="28" width="48" alt="images\check.gif"> Click the Check button to check (select) every item on the list and set all blank Date Reconciled fields to today. </P>
 <P class="Block_Text" ><IMG src="images/checkoff.gif" border="0" height="28" width="48" alt="images\checkoff.gif"> Click to de-select every item on the list and clear all Date Reconciled fields.  </P>
 <H2>1.9 New Keystroke Equivalents</H2>
 <P><IMG src="images/big_filter.gif" border="0" height="35" width="63" alt="images\big_filter.gif"> Ctrl-F now enables you to toggle in and out of the Filter screen.<BR><BR>&nbsp;&nbsp;<IMG src="images/go.gif" border="0" height="28" width="48" alt="images\go.gif"> Ctrl-G is now the equivalent of pushing GO button. Previously this was accomplished with Ctrl-R but that keystroke combination caused problems in Windows Server 2003. Note also that Ctrl-G was formerly defined as the equivalent of pushing the 'Glasses' button, which is now the 'View Data' button on the side toolbar of record viewers.</P>
 <H2>1.10  Accounting Period Viewer</H2>
 <P><FONT style="font-weight:bold; " >Unvouchered Payables</FONT> <BR>This feature is now deprecated in favor of the Create EOM Unvouchered  AP GL Entries function discussed in section 3.4 of these release notes. </P>
 <H2>1.11  ‘Take Back’ Viewer Enhancements</H2>
 <P>When you double-click on an Id field in SAM Pro, a list of active records will appear, allowing you to select and ‘take back’ a particular Id. In previous releases, this type of viewer did not include a side tool bar. In this enhancement, a side button bar has been added to enable you to select from All, Active or Closed records in the Take Back viewer. </P>
 <H3>Side Button Bar</H3>
 <P class="Body_Text" ><IMG src="images/allfilter.gif" border="0" height="28" width="48" alt="images\allfilter.gif"> Click this button to display both active and inactive records and journal entries (within your security parameters). Clicking this button also blanks all Filter range entries entered manually. </P>
 <P class="Body_Text" ><IMG src="images/activefilter.gif" border="0" height="28" width="48" alt="images\activefilter.gif"> Click this side bar button to display only active records/journal entries within your security and other filter parameters. Only those journal entries made to active accounting/payroll periods will be displayed. </P>
 <P class="Body_Text" ><IMG src="images/closed.gif" border="0" height="28" width="48" alt="images\closed.gif"> Display only those records with a status of inactive (terminated, closed, etc.) and a closed date of earlier than today.  In journal viewers, only those journal entries made to inactive accounting/payroll periods will be displayed.  </P>
 <H2>1.12  Common Phrases</H2>
 <P>Common phrases are now subject to the security level of the user. This means that keying in a Common Phrase Id that is not 'part' of a user's security id results in no auto-loading of the Common Phrase's Text value.&nbsp; To this user it will appear as though the common phrase doesn't exist. Common phrases created by global users (with no Security Id) will be available to all users.   </P>
 <H2>1.13 Bank Reconciliation Journal</H2>
 <P class="Block_Text" >On the Bank Reconciliation Journal &quot;Deposits&quot; TAB, the Date Deposited field is now displayed for Saved transactions.</P>
 <P><FONT style="font-weight:bold; " >Bank Reconciliation and Clear Checks<BR></FONT>The system no longer lists Checks reconciled via Clear Check when the AutoFill button is clicked. This enhancement enables users who have previously been using Clear Check to switch over to the new Bank Reconciliation functionality.</P>
 <H2>1.14 Bank Deposit Journal</H2>
 <P>The Bank Deposit Journal has been enhanced to recognize AR SALES TRANSACTIONS that have a GL BANK ACCOUNT reference set. (UNDEPOSITED CASH RECEIPTS or otherwise). This means that the Bank Deposits Journal now reads cash receipts that are generated from the COD tab within the Work Order.&nbsp; <FONT style="text-decoration:underline;" >The GL Account referenced on the COD tab of the Work Order should be the sweep account. </FONT></P>
 <H2>1.15  Filter Options</H2>
 <P>~&nbsp;(Global Not)</P>
 <P>The tilde (~) is also a NOT operator. When the first character is a ~ the rest of the filter range indicates which to elements to exclude.  For example, <FONT style="font-weight:bold; " >~a,p,m</FONT> will include all values except a, p or m.</P>
 <H2>1.16 Daylight Savings Time</H2>
 <P>SAM Pro has been updated to conform to the new  rules that, starting in March 2007, daylight time in the United States will begin on the second Sunday in March and end on the first Sunday in November.  This information is used for Time Zone offsets.  It is dependent upon a correct server time; be sure to verify that your servers are displaying the correct time when Daylight Savings goes into effect. </P>
 <H1>2  Registry Entries</H1>
 <H2>2.1   Registry Entry for Independent Check Section Positioning </H2>
 <H2>New Option for sys-report-rapchck (AP Checks)</H2>
 <P class="Normal_Indent" style="margin-left:5.75pt;"><FONT style="font-weight:bold; " >SectionOrder=check,stub,stub</FONT>  or <BR><FONT style="font-weight:bold; " >SectionOrder=stub,stub,check</FONT> <BR>By default, AP laser checks are printed with the check in the middle, and a stub on the top and bottom. If you want the check to print on the top of page, enter the first option (SectionOrder=check,stub,stub).  To print the stubs at the top, use the second option (SectionOrder=stub,stub,check). </P>
 <H2>2.2  Registry Entry for Scheduled Events</H2>
 <H3>Purpose:</H3>
 <P>This registry entry should be implemented if SAMPRO is to <FONT style="font-weight:bold; " >prevent</FONT> manual changes to Scheduled Events that were initially created from an Escalation Profile.&nbsp; </P>
 <H3>Usage:</H3>
 <P>Profile-based scheduled events created before installing SAMPRO v6.1 won't be subject to this restriction even with the appropriate registry entry in place.</P>
 <H3>Important Fields:</H3>
 <H6>Id:&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </H6>
 <H6 style="text-indent:30.25pt;">sys-viewer-vschdldevnt</H6>
 <H6>Contents/Additional Contents:&nbsp;&nbsp; </H6>
 <H6 style="text-indent:30.25pt;">DenyChangesToProfileEvents=true</H6>
 <H2>2.3  Registry Entry for E-mail</H2>
 <H3>New Options for sys-email </H3>
 <P><FONT style="font-weight:bold; " >Contents / Additional Contents:&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</FONT></P>
 <P><FONT style="font-weight:bold; " >EmailReportAsType=</FONT><FONT style="font-weight:bold; font-style:italic; " >pdf,html,text,csv</FONT><FONT style="font-weight:bold; " >&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; (pick only one option)</FONT></P>
 <P>This entry applies&nbsp;to pushing the Email button on the side toolbar when displaying a report on screen. It sets the default attachment type of the report.  The attachment type defaults to pdf if this option is not specified.</P>
 <H6>UseOutlook=true</H6>
 <P>If this entry is present, processing of the outgoing e-mail is passed on to MS Outlook with the to-address, subject, message and attachments&nbsp;defaulted when applicable.&nbsp; NOTE:&nbsp; this is intended to be used with Outlook.&nbsp;&nbsp;Outlook Express doesn't support the command-line attachments.&nbsp; Other email clients may or may not work.&nbsp; The only supported option is MS Outlook.&nbsp;</P>
 <H6>MailerMethod=Java</H6>
 <P>This registry option results in Java code sending all e-mail that initiates from within the system, not SAM Pro. Not that Java is used when sending e-mail with PDF attachments. This option may be utilized if difficulties with e-mail are being experienced. Do not implement this registry entry until you have discussed it with your support representative. </P>
 <H6 class="Heading9" >CopyAll=emailaddress</H6>
 <P class="Block_Text" >This option enables you to send a carbon copy of all e-mail generated out of SAM Pro to a specific address or addresses (separated by commas). This option would typically be implemented for testing purposes for a limited time frame. </P>
 <H3>SMTP Authentication</H3>
 <P><FONT style="font-weight:bold; " >usernamesmtp=</FONT><FONT style="font-weight:bold; font-style:italic; " >name<BR></FONT><FONT style="font-weight:bold; " >passwordsmtp=</FONT><FONT style="font-weight:bold; font-style:italic; " >password</FONT></P>
 <P>SAM Pro’s SMTP mechanism now includes an Authentication mechanism for mail servers providing LOGIN authentication (Microsoft Exchange Server and MDaemon, for example).</P>
 <P>LOGIN authentication requires the knowledge of a valid username/password pair. These may be supplied in the option dictionary passed to the ‘SMTP&gt;&gt;sendMail:’ command. The dictionary keys for these parameters are ‘#Username’ and ‘#Password’. If these parameters are missing from the option dictionary, (as is normally the case) an attempt is made to retrieve them from the Registry from this registry entry. If LOGIN authentication fails, a non-authenticated session (like the one implemented in previous releases) will be attempted.</P>
 <H2>Log SMTP Conversations</H2>
 <P>A registry entry may be used to turn on the logging of SMTP conversions to a log file. To turn on logging for support purposes, add the following entry:<BR><BR><FONT style="font-weight:bold; " >smtplogpath=</FONT><FONT style="font-weight:bold; font-style:italic; " >C:\someDirectory\someFileName.log</FONT></P>
 <H2>2.4  Registry Entry for New Call</H2>
 <H3>New Options for sys-newcall</H3>
 <P class="Tip_Note_Heading" style="margin-top:4.00pt;">Contents / Additional Contents:&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</P>
 <H6 class="Heading8" >DefaultStartDate=today</H6>
 <P>&nbsp;By default, when you begin to create a work order in New Call, the Date Scheduled is not set.  This option sets the default Date Scheduled to today’s date. This can be further modified as follows:</P>
 <P>DefaultStartDate=today+1</P>
 <P>&nbsp;That means the default starting date is tomorrow.&nbsp; You can add as many days as you want after the plus sign.</P>
 <H6>DefaultPO=true</H6>
 <P>This setting causes the new WO's PO Number to default from the PO Number in the default service Job’s record. Without this entry,  the user must enter the customer’s PO number manually. </P>
 <P><FONT style="font-weight:bold; " >SiteNotesNoPrompt</FONT>=<FONT style="font-weight:bold; " >true<BR></FONT>This entry changes the default behavior of New Call – which is to prompt the user to view any notes that are associated with the selected Client Site.  If you implement this option, New Call will automatically display the list of notes with a Client Site is selected.  </P>
 <P><FONT style="font-weight:bold; " >UseSiteBranch=true<BR></FONT>This option causes all work orders created via New Call to assign the WO's branch from the Client Site's branch. This option should be implemented to avoid intermittent problems with the Branch being loaded in New Call.</P>
 <H2>2.5  Registry Entry Work Order Viewer</H2>
 <H2>New Options for sys-viewer-vwrkordr</H2>
 <H3>Enable Changes to Log Tab</H3>
 <P>Version 6.1 effectively disables the user's ability to add, change or delete lines on the Log tab of the WO viewer.&nbsp; Effective with v6.1, the default behavior for the Log tab is to deny all changes.&nbsp; The original behavior (of allowing all changes) can be restored with the following entries to sys-viewer-vvrkordr:</P>
 <P class="Tip_Note_Heading" style="margin-top:4.00pt;">Contents / Additional Contents:&nbsp;&nbsp;</P>
 <P class="Tip_Note_Heading" style="margin-top:4.00pt;">LogAddAllowed=true<BR>LogEditAllowed=true<BR>LogDeleteAllowed=true</P>
 <P class="Block_Text" >Entering all three options will enable your users to add, change and delete. It is not necessary to completely restore the original behavior.&nbsp; </P>
 <P class="Block_Text" style="margin-left:72.00pt;"><FONT style="font-weight:bold; text-decoration:underline;" >Example: </FONT></P>
 <P class="Block_Text" style="margin-left:72.00pt;">One might choose to allow adds but not edits or deletes: </P>
 <P>&nbsp;LogAddAllowed=true</P>
 <H3>Site Equipment History</H3>
 <P><FONT style="font-weight:bold; " >ShowEquipmentHistory=All<BR></FONT>If this option is implemented,<FONT style="font-weight:bold; " > </FONT> ALL Site Equipment history, not just the history for the equipment on the WO will appear on the Equipment History tab of the Work Order. Note that a WO that doesn't include any equipment will NOT appear on the Equipment History tab no matter how the new option is set.</P>
 <H3>Specify WO Inventory Expense Account Assignment (and Job EOM)</H3>
 <P class="Tip_Note_Heading" style="margin-top:4.00pt;">INVExpenseFromCostCategory=true or false(default)</P>
 <P>This registry option enables you to override the default behavior that GL Expense Account assignment is derived from Inventory Group Expense account and instead enable Expense account posting to come from the Cost Category selected on the WO Inventory line (if present).</P>
 <P><FONT style="font-weight:bold; " >Important Note – Job EOM:</FONT> In conjunction with this registry entry, a change has been made to the default behavior of the Job EOM function. By default, the GL Expense account will now be set from the Inventory Group record. This registry entry enables you to derive the GL Expense Account assignment from the Cost Category for both Job EOM and the WO Inventory tab. </P>
 <H3>Prevent WO’s from being be set to Invoice Ready with Open PO Lines <FONT style="font-weight:normal; text-decoration:underline;" >(restores default behavior!)</FONT></H3>
 <P class="Reference_Line" style="margin-bottom:0.00pt;"><FONT style="font-weight:bold; " >OkToBillWithOpenPOs=false </FONT></P>
 <P>Since some customers wish to bill even if a PO is open, the default behavior of the system has been effectively changed to allow Invoice Ready with open POs.&nbsp; The user will get a warning stating that open POs do exist for the WO.&nbsp; The new default behavior can be overridden by this registry option. </P>
 <H2>2.6  Registry Entry: AP Journal</H2>

 <H2>3.4  Create EOM Unvouchered  AP GL Entries</H2>
 <H3>Purpose:</H3>
 <P class="Reference_Line" style="margin-bottom:0.00pt;">This function analyzes inventory history to identify items received, yet unvouchered and uses the P.O. costing to determine the expense that is expected when the invoices is ultimately received for the items.&nbsp; When that is the case, it is sometimes desirable to <FONT style="font-style:italic; " >account </FONT>for items &quot;received&quot;, that the client has NOT received a vendor’s invoice for.  Typically, this would be an end-of-month entry to DR Expenses and CR an Unvouchered Payables Liability Account.&nbsp; <FONT style="text-decoration:underline;" >The account debited will the account listed as the Inventory Asset Account in the Inventory Group record.</FONT>&nbsp;  </P>
 <P class="Reference_Line" style="margin-left:41.75pt;margin-bottom:0.00pt;text-indent:-18.00pt;"><FONT style="font-family:'Symbol'; font-size:9pt; " >·</FONT><span style="font-size:8pt; font-family='Times New Roman'; letter-spacing=0pt; font-weight=normal;">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</span>For purchases of ITEMS that are <FONT style="text-decoration:underline;" >Inventory Items,</FONT> one would expect that they would be attached to Inventory Groups that reference an Inventory account in this field - particularly if you were using the WO Inventory to GL feature in the Accounting Period.</P>
 <P class="Reference_Line" style="margin-left:41.75pt;margin-bottom:0.00pt;text-indent:-18.00pt;"><FONT style="font-family:'Symbol'; font-size:9pt; " >·</FONT><span style="font-size:8pt; font-family='Times New Roman'; letter-spacing=0pt; font-weight=normal;">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</span>The Inventory Group &quot;MISC&quot; is used for GEN Tab (<FONT style="text-decoration:underline;" >non-item record purchases</FONT>)...since there is no INVENTORY Tracking on such items, it would be appropriate to reference a COS Expense account in the &quot;MISC&quot; Groups inventory asset field, to effectively cause the item to be expensed by the process.</P>
 <P class="Reference_Line" style="margin-bottom:0.00pt;">There are some users that do not wish to have a balance on their GL for inventory and wish to expense all purchases directly...this can be achieved by taking the approach recommended for the &quot;MISC&quot; group within &quot;actual&quot; groups&quot; for items that are in the INVENTORY ITEM list.&nbsp; If such an approach were taken it would be inappropriate and inconsistent to use the WO Inventory to GL feature in accounting periods.</P>
 <H3>Usage:</H3>
 <P class="Reference_Line" style="margin-bottom:0.00pt;">There are two different methods of accounting for unvouchered payables: by running this function periodically (preferred) or by flagging the Unvouchered Payables flag in the Accounting Period (deprecated in versions 6.1 and up). This function would be used ONLY when Unvouchered Payables is <FONT style="font-weight:bold; " >not</FONT> being implemented for Accounting Periods!  </P>
 <P class="Reference_Line" style="margin-bottom:0.00pt;">Depending upon on your firm’s manner of doing business, you may only want to run this at year-end, but it can be performed at any month end.</P>

The last day of the &quot;posting&quot; period is used to create DR to Expense accounts (using the Inventory Asset Account in the Inventory Group) &amp; CR to UVP (using the GL Unvouchered AP Account in the Inventory Group).&nbsp; If you enter an inactive accounting period, the system will warning you that it is inactive, but not prevent you from posting to it.  This eliminates the need to temporarily re-activate a period.  It also eliminates the possibility of a data entry person posting to the period while it is temporarily active.</P>

The first day of the &quot;reversing&quot; period is used to make the net-opposite transaction, so that the Expense and Liability are only recognized on the &quot;last&quot; day {month end} financials.&nbsp; At all other points in time, it would be expected that the UVP liability has NO balance.</P>
 <P class="Reference_Line" style="margin-bottom:0.00pt;"><FONT style="font-weight:bold; " >Period Start:  Period End:   Period Active<BR></FONT>These informational fields will be displayed when the Period Id is selected. </P>

 <H2>4.6  New Record:  Consolidated Invoice Viewer</H2>
 <H3>Purpose:</H3>
 <P>This record enables consolidated invoicing, and is designed to simply the AR cycle for national accounts customers. </P>
 <H3>Usage:</H3>
 <P>Consolidated invoices are referenced in the Cash Receipts journal and may be used for reporting purposes. </P>
 <P>Consolidated Invoices enable our users to consolidate the data that they need for highly customized invoices, typically for their national accounts clients.  These customized invoices are produced outside of SAM Pro. </P>
 <H3>Important Fields: Upper Screen</H3>
 <P><FONT style="font-weight:bold; " >Consolidated Invoice Id:<BR></FONT>Enter a unique Consolidate Invoice Id.  We recommend that the initial character of this Id be specified as a letter, so that this record uses a different numbering scheme than your standard AR Invoices (which are entirely numeric). </P>
 <P><FONT style="font-weight:bold; " >Client Id:<BR></FONT>Enter the Id of the Client for whom you wish to create the consolidate invoice, or double-click to select this Id from a list. </P>
 <P><FONT style="font-weight:bold; " >Invoice Date:<BR></FONT>This field will be used as the Effective Date in conjunction with AutoFill. </P>
 <P><FONT style="font-weight:bold; " >Invoice Amount:<BR></FONT>The system will calculate this display-only field based on the individual AR Invoice totals that you select.</P>
 <P><FONT style="font-weight:bold; " >Description</FONT>:<BR>A brief description of this index for reporting purposes.</P>
 <P><FONT style="font-weight:bold; " >Auto Fill Button:<BR></FONT>Clicking this button imports all unpaid invoices for the selected client into the lower section of the viewer. Once these lines have been imported, you may delete selected invoice lines if necessary. </P>
 <H3>Important Fields: Lower Section</H3>

 <H2>4.7  AR Cash Receipts Journal</H2>
 <P>This release includes performance enhancements to this function.</P>
 <H3>4.7.1 Entering a Consolidated Invoice</H3>
 <P class="Block_Text" >The AR Cash Receipts Journal now offers Consolidated Invoice functionality.  To record receipt of a Consolidated Invoice (see section 4.6 of these release notes), complete the following steps. </P>
 <P>Beginning with a blank Cash Receipts entry screen (do not complete the Client Id), click the Auto Fill Transactions button.  </P>
 <P>When the box entitled ‘Auto-Fill Receipts Entry from List of Invoices’ appears, type in the Consolidated Invoice Id and then click OK.</P>
 <P>Note that all eligible items on the Consolidated Invoice have been selected, and appear in the center of the screen.</P>
 <P>Complete the remaining fields in the AR Cash Receipts Journal, and click the Add button. </P>
 <H2>4.7.2 GL Tab</H2>
 <P><FONT style="font-weight:bold; " >GL Entity:<BR></FONT>This is now a ‘sticky’ field:  it will retain the most recent value you entered when creating a new journal entry. </P>
 <P style="margin-top:0;margin-bottom:0">&nbsp;</P>
 <H2>4.8 Compute Service Invoices (Start Service Billing Compute)</H2>
 <P>The Service Invoice / Worksheet generation previously served by this function has been split into 2 independent functions: Compute Service Worksheets and Compute Service Invoices.&nbsp; These now need to be executed individually.&nbsp; Previously the Compute Service Invoice list had an option to print Worksheets -or- Invoices.</P>
 <P>New Fields:</P>
 <P><FONT style="font-weight:bold; " >WO Type:<BR></FONT>If you leave this range blank, work order invoices of all types will be computed. To compute and print a specific type of work order invoice, enter that type.</P>
 <P>Example:</P>
 <P>To compute only eligible PM Invoice Work Orders, enter <FONT style="font-weight:bold; " >PM Invoice</FONT> in the WO Type field. See <A href="registry_create_pm_billing_work_order_invoice.htm">the Registry Entry for Creating a PM Billing Work Order Invoice</A>  for details on PM Invoices. </P>
 <P><FONT style="font-weight:bold; " >Escalation Status:<BR></FONT>If you leave this range blank, all eligible work orders will be computed, regardless of their Escalation Status.  To limit the compute to eligible work orders of a specific Escalation Status (e.g., Invoice Review), enter it in this range field.  A series of statuses can be entered, separated by commas. </P>
 <P style="margin-top:0;margin-bottom:0">&nbsp;</P>
 <H2>4.9 New Function: Compute Service Worksheets</H2>
 <P>Previously the Compute Service Invoice list had an option to print Worksheets -or- Invoices. This is no longer implemented in Version 6.1.  Instead, The Compute Service Worksheets function should be run first to product the Worksheets.</P>
 <H3>Usage:</H3>
 <P>Compute Service Invoices and Compute Service Worksheets cannot both be open at the same time.  </P>
 <H3>Important Fields:</H3>
 <P><FONT style="font-weight:bold; " >Bill Thru Date:<BR></FONT>Line item charges with effective dates after the Bill Thru Date will not be included on the Worksheet. This field is required. </P>
 <H6>Button: Enter Work Order List</H6>
 <P>You may now print service billing worksheets in the order that the associated work order is keyed into the Workorder Id range field. When you click this button, an entry form for the Workorder Id’s will appear. </P>
 <P style="margin-top:0;margin-bottom:0">&nbsp;</P>
 <P>Enter the Work Order Ids (or double-click to select from a list).  The system will warn you if a work order is not eligible for billing.  </P>
 <P>Click the Parent Button to take the Work Order Id’s back to the Work Order Id range on the Report viewer. Commas have separated the Id’s by the system so that the range field is correctly formatted.</P>
 <P><FONT style="font-weight:bold; " >Job Id:</FONT> <BR>If you only wish to print the Worksheet for a specific Job, enter its Id.  Separating the first and last Id with an underscore can specify a range of Jobs: 1001_1025.  A series of Jobs can be specified by listing Job Id's separated by commas: 1001,1005,1025.  </P>
 <P><FONT style="font-weight:bold; " >Bill Cycle:</FONT> <BR>This field lets you specify the Billing Cycle (maintained in the Job record) to be included on the Worksheet.  To run Worksheets for Jobs with a blank Billing Cycle, simply leave this field blank. To print the Worksheet for jobs that do not contain a blank Billing Cycle field, simply enter the 1-character Billing Cycle designation in this field. </P>
 <P><FONT style="font-weight:bold; " >Workorder Id:</FONT> <BR>To print Worksheets for all eligible work orders, leave this field blank. If you only wish to print the Worksheet for a specific workorder, enter its Id.  A series of Workorders can be specified by their Id's separated by commas.  The Enter Work Order List button may be used to assist in entering and validating Workorder Ids in this range. </P>
 <P><FONT style="font-weight:bold; " >Billing Agent User Id:<BR></FONT> By default, the system will enter your user Id in this field: only those Workorders for which you were the billing agent will be included on the Worksheet. (Note that in each work order, the Billing Agent is either set in New Call or when the work order is flagged as Invoice Ready.)  To include work orders for all billing agents, blank this field. </P>
 <P><FONT style="font-weight:bold; " >WO Type:<BR></FONT>If you leave this range blank, work orders of all types will be included on this worksheet. To print the Worksheet for a specific type of work order invoice, enter that type.</P>
 <P style="margin-left:36.00pt;">Example:</P>
 <P style="margin-left:36.00pt;">To only print worksheets for eligible PM Invoice Work Orders, enter <FONT style="font-weight:bold; " >PM Invoice</FONT> in the WO Type field. See <A href="registry_create_pm_billing_work_order_invoice.htm">the Registry Entry for Creating a PM Billing Work Order Invoice</A>  for details on PM Invoices. </P>
 <P><FONT style="font-weight:bold; " >Escalation Status:<BR></FONT>If you leave this range blank, all eligible work orders will be included on the worksheet, regardless of their Escalation Status.  To limit the Worksheet of eligible work orders of a specific Escalation Status (e.g., Invoice Review), enter it in this range field.  A series of statuses can be entered, separated by commas. </P>
 <H2>4.10  Other Rate Table Rates</H2>
 <P>New Field</P>
 <P><FONT style="font-weight:bold; " >Level:<BR></FONT>This release adds sliding markup capabilities to Other Rate calculations, working in a similar fashion to the Material Mark-up table. You may now enter multiple lines for the same other rate id (i.e. Sub Materials) with increasing Levels and specified percentage mark-ups. </P>
 <P>If specified, the Level is the highest unit cost level to which the markup applies. If the Level is specified, the Rate must be set to Markup. </P>
 <P><FONT style="font-weight:bold; " >Example:<BR></FONT>Suppose that you wanted to markup SubM (subcontractor materials - an other rate) costing $100.00 or less by 100%, between $100.00 and $200.00 by 75%, and over $200 by 50%. To do so, you would set up the Level and Rate fields as follows: <BR>&nbsp;<FONT style="font-weight:bold; " >Other Rate&nbsp;Level &nbsp;&nbsp;Rate &nbsp;Bill Type Id</FONT><BR>&nbsp;SubM&nbsp;&nbsp;100.00 &nbsp;&nbsp;100.00 &nbsp;Markup<BR>&nbsp;SubM&nbsp;&nbsp;200.00 &nbsp;&nbsp;75.00 &nbsp;Markup<BR>&nbsp;SubM&nbsp;&nbsp;999999.99 &nbsp;50.00 &nbsp;Markup</P>
 <H2>4.11 Create PM Billing</H2>
 <P class="Block_Text" >When this function is used to generate PM Workorder Invoices (used for invoicing only), the entry will now be written to the Revenue Adjustment Tab (rather than the Other tab, as in version 6.0).  This change was made to accommodate the PM Accrual aspect of billing PM's from the client site bill tab.&nbsp; When accruals are being performed the invoice that is generated needs to credit a liability account rather than Income since the Income was recognized in advance of the invoice being generated.&nbsp; The OTHER tab of a work order does not let you directly influence the account for posting, but instead relies on the account stored in the Cost Code or Cost Category.  The Revenue Adjustments TAB does support setting this account directly.&nbsp; This offers enhanced flexibility that is required to handle both earn as you go, and accrual recognition for scheduled PM Billings.&nbsp; </P>
 <P><FONT style="font-weight:bold; " >Period Id:   Start Date:  End Date:<BR></FONT>This function now validates that the selected Accounting Period is &quot;active&quot; and that Start &amp; End Dates selected are BOTH valid dates within the Accounting Period.</P>
 <H2>4.12 Client Viewer</H2>
 <H2>4.12.1 Collections Screen</H2>
 <P>The Job Id, Work Order, and Client Order Id’s (if applicable) are listed for each receipt (on the bottom section of the screen).  </P>
 <P><FONT style="font-weight:bold; " >Client Viewer Collections<BR></FONT>This enhancement enables NON-sales typed invoices (credit memos, debit memos, finance charge invoices, and &quot;unapplied cash&quot; invoice records) that may be relevant to the overall collection perspective to appear on this viewer. This change allows for the display of OTHER invoice types, while continuing to prevent the receipts from factoring in.</P>
 <H2>4.13 Post Job Invoice</H2>
 <H3>New Ranges:</H3>
 <P><FONT style="font-weight:bold; " >Project Manager Id:<BR>Project Principal Id:<BR>Job Type Id:<BR>Branch Id:<BR></FONT>These ranges enable you to limit the posting function to specific Project Managers, Principals, Job Types or Branches.<FONT style="font-weight:bold; " > </FONT>A range of Id’s can be specified by separating the first and last Id with an underscore: 1001_1025.  A series of Id’s can be separated by commas: 1001,1005,1025.  </P>
 <H2>4.14 Sales Journal Viewer – Return Authorizations for COP</H2>
 <P>The Return Authorization process involves referencing an RA when creating a new Sales Journal Entry. The GL Entities on both the Sales and Costs tabs of the resulting auto filled SJ entry are currently taken from the inventory group. Modify the process to take the GL Entities from the line on the referenced Client Order pertaining to the referenced Inventory Item. This is the source of the GL Entities on the Sales Journal entry being 'credited'.</P>
 <H1>5   General Ledger</H1>
 <H2>5.1 View GL Report</H2>
 <P>The View GL Structure button now correctly displays the GL Account report. </P>
 <H2>5.2 GL Report Writer Enhancements</H2>
 <H3>5.2.1 GL Report Viewer</H3>
 <P><FONT style="font-weight:bold; " >Font for Header Lines: Font Name<BR></FONT><FONT style="font-weight:bold; " >Font for Report Lines: Font Name<BR></FONT>Previously, if you specified a font that was not installed on the system on which the report is being generated, Windows substituted an arbitrary (and inappropriate) font. The report generator now checks to see if the font is installed and, if not, substitutes Courier New.  Most users find either &quot;LUCINA CONSOLE&quot; or &quot;PRESTIGE FIXED&quot; to be much more attractive than the base &quot;COURIER NEW.” This enhancement enables you to specify these more attractive fonts regardless of whether every system (the report might be run on) has these fonts available. </P>
 <P><FONT style="font-weight:bold; " >Consolidated Mode<BR></FONT>A report is now automatically run in consolidated mode if the column definitions for the report do not contain any columns that identify entities. Previously, the ‘Consolidated Report?’ check box needed to be checked to run in consolidated mode.</P>
 <H3>5.2.2  GL Column Layout</H3>
 <H3>New Operand Tokens for Column Formulas</H3>
 <P class="Block_Text" >Six new tokens have been added for use in defining column formulas:</P>
 <P class="Body_Text_2" style="margin-left:36.00pt;">BEGY &nbsp;(opening balance at the beginning of the year)<BR>BEGQ &nbsp;(opening balance at the beginning of the report period's quarter)<BR>ENDY&nbsp;(synonymous with 'END', added for symmetry)<BR>ENDQ &nbsp;(synonymous with 'END', added for symmetry)<BR>NETY &nbsp;(the year to date net at the ending of the report period)<BR>NETQ &nbsp;(the quarter to date net at the ending of the report period)</P>
 <P class="Body_Text_2" style="margin-left:72.00pt;">Note that NETQ is equivalent to Quarter To Date and NETY is equivalent to Year To Date.</P>
 <H3>5.2.3 GL Row Layout</H3>
 <H3>Token Mapping and Column Definitions</H3>
 <P class="Body_Text_2" >The production of Cash Flow reports requires that certain report rows have column formulas that are different from the column definitions specified in the GL Column Layout. It turns out that this can be accomplished by changing the meaning of certain operand tokens used in the column formulas.</P>
 <P class="Body_Text_2" ><FONT style="font-weight:bold; " >Misc:</FONT></P>
 <P class="Body_Text_2" >The row’s Misc field is used to accomplish the required token mapping. To place a token mapping in the Misc field, enter a string of the form ‘~&lt;MappedToken&gt;&lt;MappedToToken&gt;’ where ‘&lt;MappedToken&gt;’ and ‘&lt;MappedToToken&gt;’ are two character abbreviations of formula tokens. The available abbreviations are:</P>
 <P class="Body_Text_2" style="margin-left:36.00pt;">BP, EP, NP&nbsp;for BEG, END, and NET<BR>BQ, EQ, NQ&nbsp;for BEGQ, ENDQ, and NETQ<BR>BY, EY, NY&nbsp;for BEGY, ENDY, and NETY.</P>
 <P class="Body_Text_2" >Multiple mappings may be stringed together in the Misc field.</P>
 <P class="Body_Text_2" style="margin-left:36.00pt;"><FONT style="font-weight:bold; text-decoration:underline;" >Example:</FONT></P>
 <P class="Body_Text_2" style="margin-left:36.00pt;">For example to map the NET token to the BEG token and the NETY token to the BEGY token, place the following in the Misc field:</P>
 <P class="Body_Text_2" style="margin-left:72.00pt;">~NPBP~NYBY</P>
 <H3>Lines Generated from the Text Field</H3>
 <P><FONT style="font-weight:bold; " >Text:<BR></FONT>Report lines generated from the ‘Text’ field of a report row definition no longer have their leading blanks removed. This gives the report designer the ability to simulate indentation of text lines.</P>

 <H3>9.3.1 Classic / Hours Board</H3>
 <P>With this release (6.1), the date range of dispatches on the work order list (the lower section of the board) will be set by the Date Range tab. The Date Range tab is accessible from the Power Board. In previous releases, dispatches on the work order list dates were filtered by the Date Scheduled field, located on the top button bar of the Classic/Hours board.</P>
 <P>When you right-click a dispatch on the work order list, the dispatch summary will appear.  Click the Classic board tab to redisplay the list of work orders.</P>
 <P>The system no longer displays a confirmation message when a work order is reassigned or re-sequenced  on the Classic or Hours board. </P>
 <H2>9.4 Create PM Work Orders</H2>
 <P>When Create PM Work Orders is run for sites that reference a Master Contract (PM Master Schedule), the Technician Id (on the Main tab of the Client Site Equipment record) will be used to set the default Technician in the PM Schedule (of the Equipment record) and the Work Order. If the Technician is a subcontractor, a Purchase Order will automatically be generated to the Vendor referenced in the Technician record. </P>
 <H2>9.5  Work Order Entry</H2>
 <P>If a work order is closed (e.g., the Date Closed field is completed), the system will prevent you from adding time or materials to it via the Work Order Entry function. </P>
 <P><FONT style="font-weight:bold; " >Equipment Id:<BR></FONT>You may now apply time and materials to equipment that is not yet included on the selected work order.  Double-clicking on the Equipment Id field will bring up a list of the equipment for the Client Site for which the Work Order was created.  If you select a piece of Equipment not yet included on the Work Order, the system will automatically add it to the Work Order for you when you click the Add button to create the entry.</P>
 <H2>9.6 Service Parts List Viewer</H2>
 <P><FONT style="font-weight:bold; " >Parts Type Id:<BR></FONT>A new Parts Type, Pleated Filters, has been added to this system record. Parts Type.

 <H2>9.7  Dispatcher Viewer</H2>
 <H3>Purpose:</H3>
 <P class="Reference_Line" style="margin-bottom:0.00pt;">The record is used in conjunction with the Dispatcher Id on the Dispatch Board’s Filter Calls tab. By entering a Dispatcher Id on this range, only those work orders with the corresponding Dispatcher Id will be displayed on the Dispatch Board.  This feature is intended to enable dispatchers to track only ‘their’ work orders.  </P>
 <P class="Reference_Line" style="margin-bottom:0.00pt;border-top:0.50pt solid black;border-bottom:0.50pt solid black;border-left:0.50pt solid black;border-right:0.50pt solid black;"><FONT style="font-weight:bold; " >Tip:</FONT> If technicians are shared between dispatchers, you will not be able to see these other dispatches when filtering on the Dispatcher Id on the Dispatch Board.  To view all dispatches for your technicians, blank the Dispatcher Id in the Dispatch Board’s Filter Calls tab. </P>
 <H3>Usage:</H3>
 <P>Referenced in the Client Site and Work Order records, and on the Filter Calls tab of the Dispatch Board. It may also be used for reporting purposes. If the Dispatcher Id was not set in the Client Site record when a Work Order was created, it will not automatically be included in these existing Work Orders.  Contact your support representative for details. </P>
 <P>A Dispatcher record may be associated with an individual (by completing the Employee Id).  Alternately, it may designate a position – for example, the dispatcher for A-1 Supermarkets and Acme Department stores. </P>
 <H3>Important Fields:</H3>
 <P><FONT style="font-weight:bold; " >Dispatcher Id:<BR></FONT>This required field uniquely identifies this record.</P>

These filter ranges will by saved when you exit SAM Pro, and will be restored when you log back on and start up the Alarm Board. </P>
 <H2>9.9 TechFinder Viewer</H2>
 <P>Additional functionality has been added to the Technician Pane in the upper left-hand section of the TechFinder viewer.:</P>

 <P>In previous releases, the TechFinder Scheduled Hours grid included hours for work orders lines that were set to the following statuses:  On Break, onsite, scheduled, travel, unacknowledged, waiting service, waiting quote.  The status of ‘completed’ has been added to this list. </P>
 <H2>9.10  Board Technicians Viewer</H2>
 <P><FONT style="font-weight:bold; " >All Work Orders Option (Power Board Users)<BR></FONT>To display work orders for all technicians, create a Board Technician record with an Id in the upper section but NO technicians listed in the lower section.  When this Board Technician record is selected from the Dispatch Board’s Tech List tab, work orders for all technicians (and unassigned work orders) will appear in the Work Order list.  The Work Order Summary (in the upper section of the Dispatch Board) will display only two lines – for Unassigned Work Orders and All Work Orders. </P>

 <H3>10.1.2 Scope Tab</H3>
 <P><FONT style="font-weight:bold; " >Flat Rate Category:<BR></FONT>If a Flat Rate Category is imported, and the flat rate price is zero, all imported costs will be passed through the appropriate rate schedule, margin or mark up calculations.</P>
 <H3>10.1.3 Quotemaster Wizard</H3>
 <P>The Quotemaster Wizard now disallows the export of approved Quote Master lines to closed Work Orders.</P>
 <P>Running the Quotemaster Wizard will now correctly trigger escalation in new work orders.</P>
 <H1>11  Manufacturing</H1>
 <H2>11.1 COP Invoice</H2>
 <P>The report footer on the COP Invoice no longer uses the linesPerPageAdjustment registry adjustment in <FONT style="font-weight:bold; " >sys-report-copinvce</FONT>. The assumption is that the lines per page setting is measured to the bottom of the report 'body' and does not include the footer.</P>
 <P>COP Invoices with Sales Tax post successfully. </P>
 <H2>11.2 The Drop Ship Wizard</H2>
 <H3>Purpose:</H3>
 <P>When a client orders an item that you do not have in stock, one solution is to have it drop shipped from your vendor directly to your customer.  This release supports the Drop Ship Wizard.  The Wizard is designed to step you though the process of completing the Client Order and Generating a Purchase Order for the merchandise.  The COP Invoice for this order will be help until the Purchase Order is vouchered. </P>
 <P>The Drop Ship Wizard will only be invoked if the order type is ‘order’. This implies that you can save an order with drop shipments as a ‘quote’ without invoking the wizard. When the quote becomes an order, the operator will change the order type from ‘quote’ to ‘order’. The Drop Ship Wizard will then be invoked when the order is saved.</P>
 <H3>Usage:</H3>
 <P>The Drop Ship Agent box in the user’s record must be flagged to enable drop ship processing. </P>
 <H3>Important Fields: Verify Purchase Order Lines</H3>
 <P><FONT style="font-weight:bold; " >Vendor Id:<BR></FONT>Enter the Vendor that should drop ship this item, or double click to select from a list. </P>
 <P><FONT style="font-weight:bold; " >Inventory Id:<BR></FONT>This display only field defaults from the COP Order. </P>
 <P><FONT style="font-weight:bold; " >Inventory Item Name:   Vendor Part Number:   Unit Cost:<BR></FONT>These fields default from the Inventory Item record but may be changed by the user if needed. </P>
 <P><FONT style="font-weight:bold; " >Quantity:<BR></FONT>This field defaults from the Client Order; the user may adjust it. </P>
 <H3>Important Buttons:</H3>
 <P class="Block_Text" >Click the <FONT style="font-weight:bold; " >Cancel </FONT>button to stop the generation of the drop ship purchase orders.</P>
 <P class="Block_Text" >Click the <FONT style="font-weight:bold; " >Finish</FONT> button to generate the Purchase Order; the system will display the PO Id when the generation is completed. </P>
 <H2>11.3 Client Order Viewer</H2>
 <P>When creating a Client Order, the system now checks the status of the Client Site as well as the Client (specified in the COP Tab of the Site record).  Orders are now permitted only if both the Site and Client  have a status of ‘Active.’</P>
 <H3>11.3.1 Main Tab</H3>
 <P><FONT style="font-weight:bold; " >Site Id:   Location Id:<BR></FONT>After entering line item data,  the user can no longer change the Site Id and/or the Location Id.&nbsp; This is necessary because the COP line is constructed using info from both the site and location records as the user enters the order's items. If you are creating a new order, all item lines must be deleted before changing the Site or Location. </P>
 <P><FONT style="font-weight:bold; " >Order Type: Transfer<BR></FONT>In previous releases, the Client and Site were required fields in the Client Order viewer. Since these fields should not be required for ‘Transfer’ orders, the validation has been changed to be sensitive to whether or not the order is a ‘Transfer’ order. </P>
 <P>On ‘Transfer’ orders, the transfer to location’s address is now copied to the order’s Ship Address.</P>
 <P class="Tip_Note_Heading" style="margin-top:4.00pt;"><FONT style="font-weight:normal; " >When entering a line item, the system checks to see if there was a prior order for the same item for the same client. If so, the item description field is set to the corresponding field in the invntryitmbyclnt record. Otherwise, it is set to the inventory item's name field. In previous builds, this was overridden for transfer orders. The default behavior will apply to transfer orders as well. </FONT></P>
 <P><FONT style="font-weight:bold; " >Order Type: Order<BR></FONT>The Drop Ship Wizard will only be invoked if the order type is ‘order’. This implies that you can save an order with drop shipments as a ‘quote’ without invoking the wizard. When the quote becomes an order, the operator will change the order type from ‘quote’ to ‘order’. The Drop Ship Wizard will then be invoked when the order is saved.</P>
 <P><FONT style="font-weight:bold; " >Changed Field - Account Manager Id:<BR></FONT>This optional field defaults from the Client Site record; if it is not completed in the Site record it will default from the Client.  </P>
 <P><FONT style="font-weight:bold; " >Changed Field - Sales Rep Id:<BR></FONT>The primary Sales Rep for this Client Order.  This field will default from the Client Site record; if it is not completed in the Site record it will default from the Client. </P>

 <P><FONT style="font-weight:bold; " >New Field: <BR>Drop Ship?<BR></FONT>Flag this field if this item should be drop-shipped from your vendor directly to the client’s site. This field must be set before you enter the Inventory Item Id or Quantity. When you click the Add or Save button, and the Order Type is set to Order, the Drop Ship Wizard so that a PO can automatically be generated to a Vendor. </P>
 <P><FONT style="font-weight:bold; " >Tip</FONT>: You can save an order with drop shipments as a ‘quote’ without invoking the wizard. When the quote becomes an order, the operator will change the order type from ‘quote’ to ‘order’. The Drop Ship Wizard will then be invoked when the order is saved.</P>
 <P><FONT style="font-weight:bold; " >PO Id:<BR></FONT>If completed, this display-only field lists the PO generated by the Drop Ship Wizard. </P>
 <P><FONT style="font-weight:bold; " >GL Entity Id:</FONT> <BR>In this release, the GL Entity now defaults from the Inventory Group associated with this Item if a GL Entity is not specified in either the Client Site or Location record.  </P>
 <P>The GL Entity defaults from the Location record (first), Client Site record (second) or Inventory Group (third). The GL entity in the Location will override the GL entity specified on the Client Site and Inventory Item Group. If you want the Client Site to supply the entity do not enter one in the Location.  To default the GL Entity from the Inventory Item Group, the GL Entity fields should be blank in both the Location and the Client Site records.</P>
 <H2>11.4  Post Back Orders</H2>
 <P>This function now notifies the user if ‘Go’ is pressed but no inventory item was selected. Previously, this caused an error.</P>
 <H2>11.5  Post Shop Back Orders</H2>
 <P>This function now notifies the user if ‘Go’ is pressed but no inventory item was selected. Previously, this caused an error.</P>
 <H2>11.6 Fill BackOrders (COP and Shop Orders)</H2>
 <P>In previous releases, in the Back Orders Fill functions for COP and Shop Orders, the back orders are initially listed only for the Location Id identified by the Location Id field in the current user's User record. <BR>Since a Location Filter has been added to the User record, this enhancement changes the Back Orders Fill logic to take the initial location or locations from the contents of the user's Location Filter field. If the user's Location Filter is blank, take the initial location from the user's Location Id field as before.</P>
 <H2>11.7 Shop Orders</H2>
 <P class="Tip_Note_Heading" style="margin-top:4.00pt;">Changed Field - Serial #:<BR><FONT style="font-weight:normal; " >When you double-click this field, the serial/lot number will now be filtered to only those for the selected Inventory Item number. </FONT></P>

 <P><FONT style="font-weight:bold; " >Classic Dispatch Board<BR></FONT>This corrects a System Primitive Error that occurred when a technician not included on the current dispatch board was selected in a Work Order Summary (on the lower half of the board).  In this build, the system will warn you that the technician is not on the board, and disallow the change.</P>
 <P class="Block_Text" >If you need to change to a technician that is not listed on the board, access the full Work Order Viewer and edit the Technicians tab.</P>
 <P><FONT style="font-weight:bold; " >Bank Deposits Journal<BR></FONT>The Bank Deposit Journal has been enhanced to recognize AR SALES TRANSACTIONS that have a GL BANK ACCOUNT reference set. (UNDEPOSITED CASH RECEIPTS or otherwise). This means that the Bank Deposits Journal now reads cash receipts that are generated from the COD tab within the Work Order.&nbsp; <FONT style="text-decoration:underline;" >The GL Account referenced on the COD tab of the Work Order should be the sweep account. </FONT></P>
 <P><FONT style="font-weight:bold; " >Job EOM<BR></FONT>Client reported that a Job which had 2 Inventory Items on the Workorder, JOB EOM function only picked up 1 of the 2 items on the SAME workorder --- seems these items use the same cost category but use different inventory groups, the last entry posted to the GL using the GL Acct from the Cost Category (not Inventory Group... opposite of the new default behavior). If 2 Inventory Items on W/O are going to 2 different Inventory Groups but both use the same Job Cost Category, system is only picking up the last entry but booking this to wrong GL account.&nbsp;</P>
 <P class="Normal_Indent" ><FONT style="font-weight:bold; " >JC Job Invoice Reverse<BR></FONT>Allow zero-dollar invoice reversals. </P>
 <P><FONT style="font-weight:bold; " >Exclude Retainage from Sales Tax Base<BR></FONT>For Canadian Invoicing – see customer notes section 2.19 for this registry option for the sys-ffv-global-settings entry.</P>

 <P><FONT style="font-weight:bold; " >Bank Reconciliation Journal<BR></FONT>On the Bank Reconciliation Journal &quot;Deposits&quot; TAB, the Date Deposited field is now displayed for Saved transactions.</P>
 <P><FONT style="font-weight:bold; " >Client Viewer Collections<BR></FONT>This enhancement enables NON-sales typed invoices (credit memos, debit memos, finance charge invoices, and &quot;unapplied cash&quot; invoice records) that may be relevant to the overall collection perspective to appear on this viewer. This change allows for the display of OTHER invoice types, while continuing to prevent the receipts from factoring in.</P>
 <P><FONT style="font-weight:bold; " >PO viewer – Inactive Accounting Period Reversal Logic<BR></FONT>Implement the technology in the Purchase Order as was done in other journals so that switching out an inactive period does not lead undesirable activity in inactive periods. </P>
 <P><FONT style="font-weight:bold; " >Work Order viewer – Computed / Paid Labor Lines<BR></FONT>Version 6.1 has tightened up on the user’s ability to edit work order labor lines that have been computed.  Due to work flow ramifications, this new build makes a distinction between 'computed' and 'paid' labor lines:</P>
 <P>Lines that have been computed AND paid can't be deleted and have restrictions as to which fields can be changed.</P>
 <P>Lines that have been computed but NOT paid can be changed and/or deleted.&nbsp; However, when this happens, a recompute of the PR calculations is required.&nbsp; The WO viewer will advise the user when this requirement is being initiated.&nbsp; Furthermore, the computed PR is adjusted so that a check can't be printed without recomputing.</P>

 <P><FONT style="font-weight:bold; " >Invoicing<BR></FONT>Sales Tax on Labor is now calculated correctly</P>
 <P><FONT style="font-weight:bold; " >Quote Master Approval Wizard<BR></FONT>The Job Budget option is not currently implemented, so it has been removed from the wizard screen.  This functionality has been scheduled for Version 7.0. </P>
 <P><FONT style="font-weight:bold; " >Quotemaster<BR></FONT>If you specify an Other Rate that is associated with a material cost category type, the system now runs the cost through the material markup table at the correct level. </P>
 <P>If you create a quote and attach it to an existing work order, the tax group is now set correctly.  Tax types will also be displayed correctly on Quotemaster detail lines. </P>
 <P><FONT style="font-weight:bold; " >Labor Journal / Work Order Pay Rate Calculations<BR></FONT>See section 2.28 for a registry entry that enables you to use apply a premium earnings group on top of the employee’s base rate. </P>
 <P><FONT style="font-weight:bold; " >WO Purchase Tab<BR></FONT>When a PO is generated by Quote Master its information should be reflected in the WO's Purchases tab. In previous builds, the Unit Cost and Amount appeared as zero dollars. From this build forward, the costs from PO’s generated by Quote Master will be correctly displayed. This fix is not retroactive: WO Purchase costs from purchase orders previously generated by Quote Master will not be revised. </P>
 <H3>Build 53</H3>
 <P><FONT style="font-weight:bold; " >AP/PO<BR></FONT>Fixes a variety of AP/PO problems related to POs created in v5.1 and edited in v6.1. Editing PO-GEN lines originally entered using v5.1 resulted in a situation where the Receipted-to-JCH flag was set to true but the corresponding JCH receipts were incorrect.&nbsp; </P>
 <H3>Build 52</H3>
 <P><FONT style="font-weight:bold; " >PO</FONT><FONT style="font-weight:bold; " > Validations Added<BR></FONT>Prevents the editing of receipts quantity resulting in less than AP Voucher Quantities. Also, restrict edits to P.O. JOB ORDER &amp; RECEIVE Quantities subject to RECEIPT Activity. </P>

 <P><FONT style="font-weight:bold; " >AP and GL Journal Undo (Delete) <BR></FONT> When these notes were first published, however, this functionality was but disabled except in runtime mode; this has been corrected. See section 3.1.2 for details.</P>
 <P><FONT style="font-weight:bold; " >PO’s – MISC Inventory Group<BR></FONT>Renaming or deleting MISC Inventory Group caused GL Entity to always default blank on P.O. Gen Tab lines. This dependency is no longer necessary. </P>
 <P><FONT style="font-weight:bold; " >Process PWP Billed List<BR></FONT>In previous builds, if this was performed on a job cost history line that has revenue an out-of-synch situation would arise. This case corrects this issue. </P>
 <P><FONT style="font-weight:bold; " >AP Journal<BR></FONT>When you voucher a PO with inventory lines that are neither lot-controlled nor serialized, the character 'U' erroneously appears in the dsply_text_1 field of the Inventory tab. The “U” is now cleared when you save the transaction.</P>
 <P><FONT style="font-weight:bold; " >Create New PM Schedules from Old<BR></FONT>Corrects problem where<FONT style="font-weight:bold; " > </FONT>boxes flagged with filters, belts and other did not carry forward to the new entry. </P>

 <P><FONT style="font-weight:bold; " >Email by Section<BR></FONT>Additional code refinements added to use scheduled event's emailFrom when available.</P>
 <P><FONT style="font-weight:bold; " >Tab order not advancing line on child views<BR></FONT>Corrects problem when tabbing through fields on a child line view (ie work order labor tab) where the cursor won't advance to a new line after reaching the end of the tab order.</P>

 <P><FONT style="font-weight:bold; " >WO viewer - Thumbs Up and Ready to Invoice<BR></FONT>Clicking the THUMBS UP button on the Main tab sets the Billing Agent Id whereas clicking the &quot;ready to invoice&quot; checkbox did NOT set the billing agent. The Billing Agent Id field is now also set when the Ready to Invoice box is checked and the WO saved.</P>
 <H3>Build 50</H3>
 <P><FONT style="font-weight:bold; " >Email by Section<BR></FONT>One of our custom reports included an e-mail by section option.  This functionality is now correctly implemented. </P>

 <H3>Build 49</H3>
 <P><FONT style="font-weight:bold; " >Void Check - wrong accounting period<BR></FONT>The system was using the original trx's accounting period, not the accounting period entered by the user. This has been corrected.</P>
 <P><FONT style="font-weight:bold; " >Make all history entries created on a given event have the same posting date and time<BR></FONT>The time it takes to process a transaction may cross the time barrier resulting in history entries being stamped with different posting times. Modify the Add, Save, and Delete cycles so that all history entries generated by a given Add, Save, or Delete are stamped with the same posting Date and Time. </P>

 <P><FONT style="font-weight:bold; " >Client Web Interface<BR></FONT>Change 'Open Requests' code to show both New and Unacknowledged weblogs.  In previous builds, only ‘New’ weblogs appeared in the CRMAnywhere Open Requests tab.</P>
