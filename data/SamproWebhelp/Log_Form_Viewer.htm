<h1>Log Form Viewer (for work order metrics)</h1>
<h2>Purpose:</h2>
<p>The Log Form Viewer is used to establish a list of system metrics to 
 be captured by the technician when working on a piece of equipment.</p>
<p>When a PM Work Order is created, the Log Form referenced in the Site 
 Equipment record will be written to the WO&#39;s Equipment tab, and is used 
 to generate the lines on the Work Order Metrics tab.</p>
<p>When a Work Order is created in New Call, the user may override the 
 Log Form Id from the Equipment record. The Log Form Id selected in New 
 Call will be written to the new WO&#39;s Equipment tab, and will control the 
 WO&#39;s metrics.</p>
<h2>Usage:</h2>
<p>When a service or PM work order referencing a log form is created in 
 SAM Pro, metrics (log form lines) will only be written to the Work Order 
 Metrics tab if the Technician is not a TechAnywhere tech (e.g., Remote 
 Access is set to None) or if no Tech is specified. If it is initially 
 assigned to a technician with remote access, metrics will be uploaded 
 to the technician’s device, and then posted to the work order in SAM Pro 
 when they have been completed in the field.</p>
<p>A Log Form line may not be deleted from this viewer if it is already 
 referenced on a Work Order Metrics tab.</p>
<p>The user is warned if he or she changes the Line, Header or UM (Unit 
 of Measure) of a line that exists in work order system metrics:</p>
<p style="margin-left: 36.00pt;">&quot;This field has been referenced in 
 the work order metrics tab *** times. Any changes to this field should 
 only be to correct typos or to clarify the test parameters - NOT to change 
 the purpose of this metric.&quot;</p>
<p><font style="font-weight: bold;">C</font><font style="font-weight: bold;">ycle 
 Code Filtering:<br/>
</font>The Log Form specified on the Client Site Equipment record may include 
 lines metrics that should be recorded at every service or maintenance 
 call, as well as some that need only be recorded on (for example) system 
 startup or installation. In this release, both Sam Pro and TechAnywhere 
 have been enhanced to filter (via the specified &quot;Cycle Code Filter&quot; 
 associated with PM schedules and service Work Codes) the lines written 
 to the Work Order Metrics tab. This enhancement allows the filtering of 
 the metrics lines by CC (Cycle Code).</p>
<h2>Important Fields: Upper Section</h2>
<p><font style="font-weight: bold;">Log Form Id:<br/>
</font>Uniquely identifies this record; this field is required.</p>
<p><font style="font-weight: bold;">Log Form Name:<br/>
</font>Briefly describes this Log Form.</p>
<p><font style="font-weight: bold;">Obsolete</font><font style="font-weight: bold;">?</font><font style="font-weight: bold;"><br/>
</font>If this field is checked, the record is considered Obsolete, and 
 it may not be directly specified during data-entry (either by entering 
 the Id or selecting it from a list). Obsoleted records can be edited and 
 the Obsolete option can be un-done when necessary. When you check the 
 Obsolete field, the following message box will be displayed:</p>
<p style="margin-left: 36.00pt;">“You have elected to obsolete this record. 
 Would you like to see existing references to this record?”</p>
<p>If you click Yes, the system will display a viewer that provides click-through 
 access to all tables referencing this record: see <a href="References_List.htm">References 
 List</a> for details.</p>
<h2>Important Fields: Lower Section</h2>
<p><font style="font-weight: bold;">Log Form Header:<br/>
Log Form Line:<br/>
</font>These fields will be displayed on the Work Order Metrics tab and 
 should clearly define the reading that should be taken.</p>
<p>Two rows in the same Log Form record may not contain identical Heading 
 and Line contents. The following error appears if you attempt to save 
 the record with this situation: “LogFormLinesByDescriptionByParentRn for 
 table ‘lgfrmlne’ would not be unique.” The user must edit the one of the 
 offending row entries to insure its uniqueness before the record can be 
 saved.</p>
<p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"> </p>
<p><font style="text-decoration: underline; ">Example:</font></p>
<p style="margin-left: 36.00pt;">Not Allowed:</p>
<p style="margin-left: 36.00pt;">Row 1: Heading: Pressure Line: Test 1</p>
<p style="margin-left: 36.00pt;">Row 2: Heading: Pressure Line: Test 1</p>
<p style="margin-left: 36.00pt;">Allowed:</p>
<p style="margin-left: 36.00pt;">Row 1: Heading: Pressure Line: Test 1</p>
<p style="margin-left: 36.00pt;">Row 2: Heading: Pressure Line: Test 2</p>
<p><font style="font-weight: bold;">UM:<br/>
</font>The unit of measure this reading should be taken in (psi, volts, 
 etc.).</p>
<p><font style="font-weight: bold;">CC:</font><br/>
The Cycle Code field may be used to control which metrics are written to 
 the Work Order Metrics tab when Service or PM Work Orders are generated. 
 Note that Log Form field in the Client Site Equipment record determines 
 which list of metrics is used.</p>
<p>When a Service Work Order is created in SAM Pro’s New Call, the system 
 will check the Cycle Code Filter in the Work Code; if this field is completed, 
 only those log form line metrics whose CC: field corresponds to the filter 
 or is blank will be written to the Work Order (for Techs without remote 
 access) or uploaded to the Technician’s device.</p>
<p>When a PM Work Order is created, the system will check the Cycle Code 
 Filter in the Client Site Equipment PM Schedule (or the Master Contract 
 Schedule). If the Cycle Code Filter in the schedule is blank, the system 
 will use the Cycle Code Filter in the Work Code instead. Only those metrics 
 whose CC: field corresponds to the filter or is blank will be written 
 to the Work Order (for Techs without remote access) or uploaded to the 
 Technician’s device.</p>
<p style="margin-left: 36.00pt;"><font style="font-weight: bold;">Tip:</font> 
 If a log form metric should ALWAYS be recorded, leave the CC field blank.</p>
