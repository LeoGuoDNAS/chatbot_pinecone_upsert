<h1>Sales Tax Group Viewer</h1>
<h2>Purpose:</h2>
<p>Create or select from your list of Sales Tax Groups.</p>
<p>Tax Group records may be manually created by the User or a part of data 
 conversion.  They may also be generated by Avalara if implemented 
 in your system.</p>
<p>Although Sales Tax data may be imported 
 from Avalara files (not via the AvaTax process), several issues have been 
 encountered in this process. SAMPro no longer support any changes to that 
 code. Users encountering issues should consider switching to the AvaTax 
 product in SAMPro 9.1. </p>
<p>Note that AvaTax is not available for 
 calculating tax costs on Use Tax Jobs.  The appropriate Sales Tax 
 Groups should be created manually for Use Tax Jobs.</p>
<h2>Example:</h2>
<p>Create a group with City and County Sales Tax Authorities.</p>
<h2>Usage:</h2>
<p><font><span style="font-weight: normal;">If a Tax Authority record is 
 changed, each Sales Tax Group record associated with the changed Tax Authority 
 will be updated when the Tax Authority record is changed.  If a Tax 
 Group record is open when the Tax Authority is updated, click Refresh 
 to see the changes.</span></font></p>
<p>Required for invoicing / recording sales and use tax. Since each group 
 may include multiple tax authorities (e.g., city, state), GL Entries are 
 made to the GL Account specified in the Tax Authority records.</p>
<h2>Important Fields: Upper Section</h2>
<p><font style="font-weight: bold;">Tax Group Id:</font><br/>
Uniquely identifies the Tax Group; this field is required. </p>
<p style="margin-left: 48px;"><span style="font-weight: bold;">Avalara 
 Web AvaTax:</span> If AvaTax is used to compute taxes for your Sales Tax 
 invoices this record will be created when the Avalara Web Service is accessed 
 during invoicing or by pressing the Set Sales Tax Authority button in 
 the Job Record. This field should NOT be changed by the user. </p>
<p style="margin-left: 48px;"><span style="font-weight: bold;">Avalara 
 Import (deprecated):</span> If this Tax Group was generated from Alavara 
 Sales Tax data, the Id will be based on the Zip Code.  However, since 
 a single zip code may encompass more than one Sales Tax Group (which specifies 
 the State, County and Municipal / Other Authorities), the Sales Tax Group 
 Id of records generated by running the Start Sales Tax Update will be 
 composed of the Zip Code optionally followed by a .### extension. For 
 example, the Sales Tax Authority with the name &quot;ARVADA JEFFERSON 
 CO COLORADO 80002&quot; is assigned the Id 80002.002 to distinguish it 
 from &quot;DENVER JEFFERSON CO COLORADO 80002&quot; with Id 80002.004. 
 In addition, Use Tax and non Use Tax groups are created via the Avalara 
 import.</p>
<p style="margin-left: 48px;"><span style="font-weight: bold;">Manual Entries:</span> 
 If your company serves customers in more than one state, including a state 
 designation within this field is recommended (e.g., OH-Middleton). </p>
<p><font style="font-weight: bold;">Tax Group Name:</font><br/>
This optional field briefly describes the Tax Group (e.g., Middleton County, 
 Ohio) and provides another look-up field.</p>
<p><font style="font-weight: bold;">Group Tax Rate:</font><br/>
The default Tax Rate that will appear on the invoice if a specific category 
 rate is not defined. The Sales Tax Authority Rate Viewer associates billing 
 categories (e.g., part, labor) with specific tax rates. The system automatically 
 rolls up the individual rates in the Tax Authority tab into the total 
 Group Tax Rate field for this record.</p>
<p>In most cases, the system will calculate this field for you based on 
 the Authorities and rates entered on the Tax Authorities tab. However, 
 this field will be forced to zero if a graduated tax rate is specified 
 in one or more of the Sales Tax Authorities listed on the Tax Authorities 
 tab.</p>
<p><font style="font-weight: bold;"><font style="font-weight: bold;">S</font>tate:</font><br/>
This field is used for reporting purposes. Enter the appropriate 2-character 
 state/provincial postal code.</p>
<p style="font-weight: bold;">County: 
 City: Zip Code:<br/>
Some or all of these informational fields are set when the <span style="font-weight: normal;">Avalara 
 Import is run or AvaTax (available in SAMPro 9.1) is used to create the 
 record. </span></p>
<p style="font-weight: bold;">Imported 
 From:<br/>
<span style="font-weight: normal;">This display field indicates the source 
 of this record.</span> </p>
<p class="MsoNormal" style="margin-left: 48px;">Imported 
 From = <b><i>blank</i></b> … this indicates the record was manually created 
 in SAMPro and it has no relationship to Avalara tax processing.</p>
<p class="MsoNormal" style="margin-left: 48px;">Imported 
 From = <b><i>Avalara</i></b> … this indicates the record was created by 
 importing from CSV files provided by Avalara.  This is an older 
 technology;  SAMPro no longer support any changes to that code. Users 
 encountering issues should consider switching to the AvaTax product available 
 in SAMPro 9.1.</p>
<p class="MsoNormal" style="margin-left: 48px;">Imported 
 From = <b><i>AvalaraService</i></b> … this indicates the record was created 
 automatically (by SAMPro) using information provided by Avalara’s AvaTax 
 web service. </p>
<p class="MsoNormal" style="margin-left: 8px;">If 
 this Group was created in SAMPro or via the Import Sales Tax (Avalara) 
 SAMPro&#39;s internal sales tax processing will be used to generate sales 
 or use tax on invoices for this job. If this field is blank in the Job 
 record, or it contains a Sales Tax Group generated by a call to the Avatax 
 Web Service, the Sales Tax (or Exempt Amount) will computed via the Avalara 
 Web Integration.<span style="font-weight: bold;"> The Tax Group must be 
 specified in the Job when invoicing through Record Billing Adjustment.</span></p>
<p><font style="font-weight: bold;">Cumulative?</font><br/>
This option may be also be set by the Tax Authority. The order of the lines 
 on the Tax Authorities tab is important because it determines the order 
 in which the individual taxes are computed and accumulated. </p>
<p style="margin-left: 36.00pt;">Upgrading from SAM Pro 6.1 or Earlier:<br/>
The Sales Tax Group Cumulative flag will be cleared during the conversion 
 from any revision level less than 367 to any revision level &gt;= 367.  If 
 this flag should be set in your data (e.g., for Canadian GTS), you must 
 do so manually for each applicable Sales Tax Group record.</p>
<p><font style="font-weight: bold;">Tax Labor: Tax Materials: Tax Other: 
 Tax Subcontract:</font><br/>
These fields define the rules that determine which Cost Categories will 
 be taxed. <font style="font-weight: bold;">Note:</font> Exceptions to 
 these rules may be entered by clicking the Exceptions tab.</p>
<p>Alternately, these sales tax rules may be set by the Tax Authority.</p>
<p> </p>
<p> </p>
<p><font style="font-weight: bold;">Obsolete</font><font style="font-weight: bold;">?</font><font style="font-weight: bold;"><br/>
</font>If this field is checked, the record is considered Obsolete, and 
 it may not be directly specified during data-entry (either by entering 
 the Id or selecting it from a list). Obsoleted records can be edited and 
 the Obsolete option can be un-done when necessary. When you check the 
 Obsolete field, the following message box will be displayed:</p>
<p style="margin-left: 36.00pt;">“You have elected to obsolete this record. 
 Would you like to see existing references to this record?”</p>
<p>If you click Yes, the system will display a viewer that provides click-through 
 access to all tables referencing this record.</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: bold;">Rate 
 Basis:  Extended Cost - Unit Cost</span><br/>
The field is display-only until such time as the tax calculation code supports 
 unit cost based calculations (needed for Tennessee Sales Tax).</p>
<h2>Important Fields: Lower Section Tax Authorities Tab</h2>
<p><font style="font-weight: bold;">Tax Authority Id:<br/>
</font> A sales tax authority belonging to this Group. Enter a valid Tax 
 Authority Id or double-click on this field to select from a list. At least 
 one Sales Tax Authority per group is required.</p>
<p>However, validation ensures that a 
 specific Sales Tax Authority can appear no more that once in the same 
 Sales Tax Group. The system will display a &#39;Child Row Update Failed&#39; error 
 if a user attempts of add the same Sales Tax Authority more than once 
 in the Group.  </p>
<p><font style="font-weight: bold;">Note: If the Cumulative box is checked</font>, 
 the order of the lines on the Tax Authorities tab is important because 
 it determines the order in which the individual taxes are computed and 
 written to history. The tax on the first line is computed first. The tax 
 on the second line includes the accumulated tax from the first line, and 
 so on. If the order is not correct, the tax will not be allocated correctly 
 among the authorities.</p>
<p style="margin-left: 36.00pt;">Example:</p>
<p class="Normal_Indent">Tax Authority Tax Rate Cumulative Rate</p>
<p style="margin-left: 36.00pt;">A  5.00  5.0000</p>
<p style="margin-left: 36.00pt;">B  1.00  1.0500</p>
<p style="margin-left: 36.00pt;">C  7.00  7.4235</p>
<p style="margin-left: 36.00pt;">Group Tax Rate:  13.4735 if Cumulative 
 is checked</p>
<p style="margin-left: 36.00pt;">13.0000 if Cumulative is not checked</p>
<p class="Reference_Line" style="margin-bottom: 0.00pt;"><font style="font-weight: bold;">Use 
 Authority Rules: Cumulative:<br/>
</font>These display fields default from the Tax Authority record. If the 
 Use Authority Rules field is checked, the taxation rules and exceptions 
 will come from the individual authority rather than from this Sales Tax 
 Group.</p>
<p><font style="font-weight: bold;">Job Cost?</font><font style="font-weight: bold;"><br/>
</font>If this field is checked and a Job is marked as Use Tax, taxes for 
 this Authority will be treated as use tax and applied as a cost to the 
 Job. <font style="font-weight: bold;">Important note: if the Job Cost 
 box is flagged, taxes for this authority will be included in the inventoried 
 cost of items purchased to stock if the registry entry described in</font> 
 <font style="font-weight: bold;">the sys-ffv-global-settings registry 
 option</font> <a href="Registry_Entry_Global_Settings__Column_Compression__Dispatch_Board_Rows__History_Log_Inventory_Markup.htm#Global_Settings_Tax_on_Inventoried_Cost"><font style="font-weight: bold;">Include Prepaid Tax in Inventoried Cost</font></a> 
 <font style="font-weight: bold;">is implemented.</font></p>
<p>If this field is checked and the Job is marked as Sales Tax, taxes for 
 this Authority will be treated as use tax and applied as a cost to the 
 Job, and will NOT be included on the customer’s Invoice.</p>
<p>Appropriate entries will be written to Job History from the Purchase 
 Order, Inventory Receipts, and AP Journals General Tab. Note that Vendor 
 tax recorded on the AP Journal taxes tab will not be Job Costed: see <a href="AP_Journal_Tax_Tab.htm">AP Journal Taxes Tab</a> for details 
 using this tab.</p>
<p class="Reference_Line" style="margin-bottom: 0.00pt;"> <font style="font-weight: bold; 
	 text-decoration: underline; ">Example:  Ontario Tax Group for 
 Fixed Fee Jobs</font></p>
<p class="Reference_Line" style="margin-left: 36.00pt; margin-bottom: 0.00pt;">Typically, 
 sales-taxable, Fixed Fee jobs do not invoice PST. The following example 
 illustrates how to set up this Tax Group so that the OPST will be treated 
 as Use Tax but the customer will only be invoiced for the GST.</p>

<p class="Reference_Line" style="margin-left: 36.00pt; margin-bottom: 0.00pt;">Typically, 
 sales-taxable T&amp;M jobs invoice PST and GST. The following example 
 illustrates how to set up this Tax Group so that the customer will be 
 invoiced for both the OPST and the GST.</p>
<p class="Reference_Line" style="margin-bottom: 0.00pt;"> <font style="font-weight: bold;">Tax

<h2>Important Fields: Lower Section Exceptions Tab</h2>
<p><font style="font-weight: bold;">Cost Category:<br/>
</font> A Cost Category that is an exception to the taxing rules in the 
 upper section of this viewer. For example, suppose that most Cost Categories 
 with a Cost Type of Other are taxed by this Tax Group. However, your Cost 
 Category &quot;Fees and Permits&quot; (with a Cost Category Type of Other) 
 is not taxed. In this case, the Tax Other field in the upper section would 
 be checked, and Fee-Permits entered as Cost Category Id in the Exceptions 
 tab of the lower section.</p>
