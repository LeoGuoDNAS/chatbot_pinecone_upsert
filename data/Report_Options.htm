<h1>Report Options</h1>
<p>The Report Options selector pane controls how the report will be output. 
 The following options are available:</p>
<h2>Preview Report</h2>
<p class="Body_Text_Indent">This outputs the report to a report viewer. 
 By default, reports will be previewed to the standard Data-Basics Report 
 viewer; you can page through the report, and then print all or part of 
 it.</p>
<p class="Body_Text_Indent">To output the report to HTML or Text, click 
 the Preview Report option and the following fields will appear:</p>
<p style="margin-left: 18.00pt;"><font style="font-weight: bold;">Preview 
 Report As: DBReport HTML Text</font><br/>
By default, reports will be previewed to the standard DBReport viewer; 
 you can page through the report, and then print all or part of it.</p>
<p class="Body_Text_Indent" style="margin-left: 36.00pt;">If you select 
 HTML (by double-clicking on the adjacent radio button) and Report Anywhere 
 is enabled, the report will display on your Internet Explorer Browser. 
 To use this option, top, bottom and side margins should be set to .5&quot; 
 in the print option of your browser.</p>
<p class="Body_Text_Indent" style="margin-left: 36.00pt;">If you select 
 Text (by double-clicking the adjacent button) the report will be displayed 
 as text within a Workspace viewer. You can edit the report directly from 
 the Workspace viewer, save it as a text file for use with your word processing 
 software, or cut and copy all or part of it to the clipboard.</p>
<p style="margin-left: 36.00pt;"><font style="font-weight: bold;">OK Cancel</font><br/>
Click OK to save your Preview selection and return to the Range listing. 
 Click Cancel to return to the Range listing without changing the Preview 
 selection.</p>
<h2>Print Report</h2>
<p>This option sends the report directly to the printer without displaying 
 the preview.</p>
<h2>Schedule Report</h2>
<p>If ReportAnywhere is implemented on your system (and the Scheduled Report 
 Manager service is running) you will be able to schedule your report to 
 run automatically and be e-mailed to the recipients of your choice, output 
 to a specific printer, or saved as an encrypted Data-Basics report for 
 later review.</p>
<p style="margin-left: 48px;"><span style="font-weight: bold;">Installing 
 New Reports:</span> If a new version of a currently scheduled report is 
 installed, some new fields included in the report (such as displayed buttons) 
 will not be included in the scheduling parameters. In this case, the report 
 will display the text &quot;Unknown&quot; for the value of the missing 
 field. The report should be manually rescheduled so that it will be generated 
 with the new report parameters. </p>
<p><font style="font-weight: bold;">Relative Dates (in a Date Field)<br/>
</font>One of the key concepts in report scheduling is that of the <font style="font-style: italic;">relative date</font>, which we introduce 
 here. Suppose that we want to run the AR Aging report at one in the morning 
 on the 1st and 16th of each month, and email the report to all members 
 of the user group Admin. The Aging Date that the report should use when 
 it is run is yesterday (either the last day of the month or the 15th). 
 Therefore, the Aging Date is <font style="font-style: italic;">relative</font> 
 to the date the report is actually run. Click <a href="Custom_Date_Strategies.htm">Custom 
 Date Strategies</a> for detail information.</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: bold;">Setting the Date to Today in a Date 
 Range</span><br/>
Some reports do not have a date field or fields (e.g., Beginning Date - 
 Ending Date), but instead have a date range. The Relative Dates discussed 
 above cannot be used in a date range, but you can filter the report to 
 the current date when it is scheduled and run. To enter an sql statement 
 in the appropriate date range and then schedule the report. For example, 
 the following sets the AR Receipts Date Effective to today when a report 
 that uses this field is run:</p>
<p style="margin-left: 48px;">sql=arrcpts_dte_effctve={fn CURDATE()}</p>
<p style="margin-left: 48px;"><img src="assets/images/image/DateRangeCurrent.gif" alt="" style="border: none;" border="0"/></p>
<p style="margin-left: 48px;">The date field mentioned in the sql would 
 depend on the report! </p>
<p><font style="font-weight: bold;">Related Records<br/>
</font>When you use ReportAnywhere to schedule report distribution to users, 
 the system will check the Email Address in the <a href="User_Account_Viewer.htm">User</a> 
 record. If you will be distributing your reports via e-mail, a registry 
 entry specifying your <a href="Registry_Entry_System_Email.htm">e-mail 
 server</a> must be made.</p>
<p>To schedule a report:</p>
<p>1. Access the Report Range screen of the report that you wish to schedule.</p>
<p>2. Complete any of the range and selection fields you wish to specify 
 for the automatic report generation.</p>
<p>3. If you want the report generation to be repeated, right-click any 
 Date settings to enter a relative date.</p>
<p>Click <a href="Custom_Date_Strategies.htm">Custom Date Strategies</a> 
 for detailed information.</p>
<p>4. When the report is run, the system will set the Date relative to 
 the date that it runs using the strategy that you select.</p>
<p>5. Click the Schedule Report option.</p>
<p>6. Enter the Run Date and Time as follows:</p>
<p><font style="font-weight: bold;">Description</font><br/>
This description will appear on the list of Scheduled Events and the Data-Basics 
 Report viewer.</p>
<p><font style="font-weight: bold;">Run Date</font><br/>
Enter the date that the report is scheduled to run. Today&#39;s date will default. 
 To change the date you can: Enter it in <font style="font-style: italic;">mmddyyyy</font> 
 format; Double-click to access the Calendar viewer; Press the + key on 
 the numeric keypad to add a day (or days) to the date. If this is a repeating 
 report, the Run Date should be the first execution date.</p>
<p><font style="font-weight: bold;">Run Time</font><br/>
Enter the time (in 24 hour/military format) the report is scheduled to 
 run. For example, to run the report at 3:00am you would enter 0300. To 
 run the report at 8:30pm, you would enter 2030. To clear the run time 
 for a repeating report, enter all zeros.</p>
<p>7. Enter the Options (discussed below) as needed for this report. Note 
 that the Repeat Event box must be checked for the report to be repeated.</p>
<p>8. When your Options have been entered correctly, click the OK button; 
 the system will validate that your options have been entered correctly. 
 </p>
<p>9. Finally, click the Go button; a 
 final validation check will be made. The system will display 
 the Scheduled Event Id for this report. Click Yes to confirm.</p>
<h3>Updating, Cloning or Canceling A Scheduled 
 Report</h3>
<p>Assess the scheduled report that you 
 wish to change and select the Schedule Report option in the upper left-hand 
 pane. The following new fields will be displayed:</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: bold;">Event 
 Id:</span><br/>
 Double-click on the Event Id. This field allows you to select from the 
 list of existing Scheduled Events for this report. Select the Schedule 
 Event for this report that you wish to change.</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: bold;">Process 
 Type:</span><br/>
 This field allows you to select what you want done to the selected Event 
 when the OK button is pressed. The 3 choices are:</p>
<p style="margin-left: 48px;"><span style="font-weight: bold;">Create 
 Only</span> - this will create a new Scheduled Event; the currently selected 
 Event will not be modified.</p>
<p style="margin-left: 48px;"><span style="font-weight: bold;">Create/Cancel</span> 
 - this will create a new Scheduled Event and remove the selected Schedule 
 Event selected in the Event Id field.</p>
<p style="margin-left: 48px;"><span style="font-weight: bold;">Update</span> 
 - this option will update the selected Scheduled Event.</p>
<p>When <span style="font-weight: bold;">OK</span> 
 is pressed on the Scheduled Report screen, the fields on the Scheduled 
 Event screen will be validated and the Report Range screen displayed. 
 Make any needed changes to any of the Range or other input field. </p>
<p>When the report options correctly configured 
 for the new/revised event, <span style="font-weight: bold;">click the 
 GO button.</span> Doing so will create/remove/update the scheduled event 
 table based on the process type.</p>
<h3>Distribution Options</h3>
<p><font style="font-weight: bold;">Email?<br/>
</font>This box must be checked for e-mail distribution. See <a href="Registry_Entry_System_Email.htm">Registry 
 Entry System Email</a> for a discussion on setting your firm’s e-mail 
 configuration.</p>
<p><font style="font-weight: bold;">Distribute as: Attachment Link<br/>
</font>Typically, Attachment would be selected. Note, however, that if 
 you elect to save your reports as text files, they will be incorporated 
 in the body of the email instead of an attachment.</p>
<p><font style="font-weight: bold;">Email Address<br/>
</font> This field is required and will default to your email address. 
 You may enter the actual email addresses to distribute the report to, 
 or an Email Group(s). <font style="text-decoration: underline; ">When 
 referencing an Email Group, you must surround the Email Group Id with 
 brackets.</font></p>
<p style="margin-left: 36.00pt;"><font style="text-decoration: underline; ">Example: 
 Email Group</font><br/>
If you have created an Email Group with the Id <font style="font-weight: bold;">sales</font>, 
 you would enter it in this field as <font style="font-weight: bold;">[sales]</font> 
 to indicate that it is a token replacement and not, itself, an email address.</p>
<p style="margin-left: 36.00pt;"><font style="text-decoration: underline; ">Emailing</font> 
 <font style="text-decoration: underline; ">and sectionvalue Reports: Email 
 Address Blank</font> <font style="text-decoration: underline; "><br/>
</font>If the report that you are running supports sectionvalues, it may 
 be scheduled and emailed directly to the email address specified in the 
 report. This type of report should be set up to run in the Scheduled Event 
 viewer, not in the Report Options screen where the Email Address must 
 be completed.</p>
<p><font style="font-weight: bold;">Email Subject<br/>
</font>Specifies the Subject line of the e-mail.</p>
<p><font style="font-weight: bold;">User List<br/>
</font>By default, this field will be set to your User Id. If you specify 
 yourself or a list of additional User Id’s, the e-mail address will be 
 taken from the Contact record referenced in each User record.</p>
<p style="margin-left: 36.00pt;"><font style="text-decoration: underline; ">Example:</font></p>
<p style="margin-left: 36.00pt;">To distribute the report to users with 
 the User Id’s TC, DS, and LS you would complete this field as follows: 
 TC,DS,LS</p>
<p><font style="font-weight: bold;">User Group List<br/>
</font>If you wish to distribute this report to all active members of one 
 or more User Groups, enter a valid User Group Id or a comma delimited 
 list of User Groups Id’s. When the report is run, the e-mail addresses 
 will be taken from the Contact record referenced in each User record.</p>
<p style="margin-left: 36.00pt;"><font style="font-weight: bold;">Imp</font><font style="font-weight: bold;">ortant Note:</font> for report scheduling 
 purposes, the system only considers the primary (header) User Group Id 
 referenced in the User record. The User record’s Additional Groups tab 
 is NOT evaluated when compiling the Email Addresses for scheduling purposes.</p>
<p style="margin-left: 36.00pt;"><font style="text-decoration: underline; ">Example:</font></p>
<p style="margin-left: 36.00pt;">To distribute the report to all active 
 users with a primary User Group Id of admin or ar, you would complete 
 this field as follows: admin,ar</p>
<p style="margin-left: 36.00pt;">This report would be distributed to all 
 users with a primary (header) User Group Id of admin or ar in their User 
 record. Users with a primary User Group Id of service, but with an Additional 
 User Group Id of admin or ar would NOT receive the report.</p>
<p><font style="font-weight: bold;">Email From<br/>
</font>The address that this e-mail comes from; this field defaults from 
 the Contact Id reference in your User Group record. This should be a valid 
 address that can be replied to.</p>
<h3>Repeat Options</h3>
<p><font style="font-weight: bold;">Repeat Event<br/>
</font>This box must be checked for a repeating report.</p>
<p><font style="font-weight: bold;">Repeat Until:<br/>
</font>Enter the date the report should be repeated until in <font style="font-style: italic;">mmddyyyy</font> 
 format.</p>
<h3>Tip: Turning Off a Repeating Report</h3>
<p style="margin-left: 36.00pt;">To turn off a repeating report, go to 
 the Scheduled Event for the report, and set its Event Status to Cancelled.</p>
<p><font style="font-weight: bold;">Run Date<br/>
</font> The day or days the report is scheduled to run.</p>
<p style="margin-left: 36.00pt;">To specify a day of the week:</p>
<p style="margin-left: 36.00pt;"> m  tu w th f sa su</p>
<p style="margin-left: 36.00pt;">To run the report more than once a week, 
 separate the days with a comma. For example, to run the report on Mondays, 
 Wednesdays and Fridays:</p>
<p style="margin-left: 36.00pt;"> m,w,f</p>
<p style="margin-left: 36.00pt;">To specify a day of the month:</p>
<p style="margin-left: 36.00pt;"> 1 2 3 4 5(etc.)</p>
<p class="Reference_Line" style="margin-left: 36.00pt; margin-bottom: 0.00pt;"> first last</p>
<p style="margin-left: 36.00pt;"> Note that <font style="font-weight: bold;">last</font> 
 would be 28 (or 29) for February, 30 for April, etc.</p>
<p class="Tip_Note_Heading" style="margin-top: 4.00pt;">Run Time</p>
<p>Enter the time (in 24 hour/military format) the report is scheduled 
 to run.</p>
<p style="margin-left: 36.00pt;">For example, to run the report at 3:00am 
 you would enter <font style="font-weight: bold;">0300</font>. To run the 
 report at 8:30pm, you would enter <font style="font-weight: bold;">2030</font>.</p>
<p style="margin-left: 36.00pt;">To run the report more than once a day, 
 enter the times separated by<br/>
commas: <font style="font-weight: bold;">0100,0900</font></p>
<p style="margin-left: 36.00pt;">To run the job multiple times, enter the 
 first and last time to run as a range, followed by the @ sign and the 
 increment in minutes.</p>
<p style="margin-left: 36.00pt;">For example, to run the report every half 
 hour from 9:00 am to 5:00pm, enter the following:  <font style="font-weight: bold;">0900_1700@30</font></p>
<p style="margin-left: 36.00pt;">To run the report every hour from 8:00 
 to 6:00, and then again at 11:00pm you would enter: <font style="font-weight: bold;">0800_1800@60,2300</font></p>
<h3>File Options</h3>
<p><font style="font-weight: bold;">Save Report File<br/>
</font> If this box is checked, a copy of the report will be saved to disk.</p>
<p><font style="font-weight: bold;">Overwrite Existing?<br/>
</font>If this box is checked, the report will overwrite an existing file 
 of this name.</p>
<p style="margin-left: 36.00pt;">In version 6.2 and below, report file 
 names are generated so that they include a date and time stamp, it is 
 highly unlikely that any overwriting will occur.</p>
<p style="margin-left: 36.00pt;">In version 7.0 and above, the system no 
 longer includes the date/time on the filename if Overwrite is selected.</p>
<p><font style="font-weight: bold;">Save Report as: PDF DBReport HTML Text 
  CSV<br/>
</font>Selects the format the report will be saved <font style="font-weight: bold; 
														 font-style: italic;">and</font> 
 sent in; by default, this field is set to PDF. Note that the intended 
 user must be running Data-Basics in order to view a DBReport file.</p>
<p>If Text is selected, the report will be embedded in the body of the 
 e-mail instead of being sent as attachment.</p>
<p><font style="font-weight: bold;">File Name<br/>
</font>This field may be used to override the default file name generated 
 by the system.</p>
<p><font style="font-weight: bold;">Directory Name<br/>
</font>Specifies the directory that the report will be saved in (e.g., 
 C:\archive\reports). This field defaults from the <a href="Registry_Entry_for_Report_Anywhere_File_Path.htm">Registry 
 Entry for Report Anywhere File Path</a> .</p>
<h3>Print Options </h3>
<p><font style="font-weight: bold;">Print Hard Copy?</font>If you check 
 this box, a hard copy of this report will be printed to the printer that 
 you select when you click Go. The printing will be in addition to any 
 other options (success as emailing or saving) that you selected. This 
 functionality also supports the printing of the bitmap assorted with the 
 report via registry.</p>
<p><font style="font-weight: bold;">Print Report as: DBReport  Text</font> 
 Selects the format used to print the report. In most cases, DBReport should 
 be selected.</p>
