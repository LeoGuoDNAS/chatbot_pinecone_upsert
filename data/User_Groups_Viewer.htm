<h1>User Groups Viewer</h1>
<h2>Purpose:</h2>
<p>User Groups define the various categories of users on the system. This 
 record also enables you to select the number of days a user password is 
 valid for members of this group, select the minimum number of letters 
 for a password, and specify the maximum number of failed login attempts 
 that members of this group are allowed.</p>
<p>This viewer can also be used to select 
 which functions are accessible to a specific User Group. The Tabs for 
 Viewers, Reports, Processes (Starter functions) and Analytics allow the 
 user to easily to locate items to enable/disable. Note that changes to 
 these settings cannot be made to the User Group &#39;All&#39;. Note that in User 
 Group All, the Viewer Export Function is supported even if the box is 
 not flagged.</p>













<h2>Example:</h2>
<p>User groups enable you to maintain security and control on your system. 
 For example, you could create groups for your sales, administrative, and 
 supervisory personnel.</p>
<h2>Important Fields: Upper Section</h2>
<p><font style="font-weight: bold;">Note:</font> this Help Topic lists 
 the standard configuration of all fields which may be included in this 
 record. If you are using a customized system, the fields displayed on 
 your screen may not exactly match the order or status (required, optional, 
 default, display-only, hidden, etc.) of the fields described in this Topic.</p>
<p><font style="font-weight: bold;">Group Id:</font><br/>
This required alphanumeric field represents a unique group Id.</p>
<p>User Group All should only be used by system admins or other high level 
 personnel. It may NOT be altered by users. Note 
 that in User Group All, the Viewer Export Function is supported even if 
 the box is not flagged.</p>
<p><font style="font-weight: bold;">Group Name:</font><br/>
A brief description of the group. This field is optional.</p>
<p><font style="font-weight: bold;">Security Id:</font><br/>
If multiple location security is implemented on your centralized database 
 system, this informational field displays the Security Id of the local 
 user that created this record. If multiple location security is not implemented 
 on your system, or if this record was created by a global user, this field 
 will be blank.</p>
<p><font style="font-weight: bold;">Password Days:</font><br/>
If this field is set to the default (0), a user&#39;s password will be good 
 indefinitely. If this field is set to a number greater than zero, it defines 
 the number of days a password is good for before it must be reset by the 
 user. When this number has been reached, a member of this group will be 
 required to enter and confirm a new password as part of the login process. 
 When a member of this group enters a new password, the Password Renewal 
 field in the User/User Functions record will be reset to the current date 
 plus the number of Password Days.</p>
<p><font style="font-weight: bold;">Minimum Password Length:</font><br/>
The minimum number of alphanumeric characters required for a group member&#39;s 
 password. Longer passwords (6-10 characters) are generally more secure, 
 but also more difficult to remember.</p>
<p><font style="font-weight: bold;">Max Failed Logins Allowed:</font><br/>
If this field is set to the default (0), a user may attempt to login indefinitely 
 without being locked out. If this field is set to a number greater than 
 zero, this field defines maximum number of logins a member of this group 
 is allowed before he or she is locked out of the system. This feature 
 reduces the chances of unauthorized users logging in, but increases the 
 chances of an authorized user being &quot;locked out&quot; due to typos 
 in the login. If an authorized user accidentally locks him or herself 
 out, the Failed Login Attempts counter in the user&#39;s record must be reset 
 to 0 by a user with access to the User or User Desktop viewer.</p>
<p style="font-weight: bold; margin-left: 48px;"> Login 
 Processing in 9.1.611.051 and Above:</p>
<p style="margin-left: 48px;">WHEN the 
 Id is valid AND the Password is valid AND the user&#39;s Failed Login Limit 
 is exceeded</p>
<p style="margin-left: 88px;">THEN the 
 &#39;User Account has too many Failed Logins&#39; error is issued instead of the 
 &#39;Invalid User Id and/or Password&#39; error.</p>
<p style="margin-left: 48px;">WHEN the 
 Id is valid AND but Password is invalid AND the user&#39;s Failed Login Limit 
 is exceeded</p>
<p style="margin-left: 88px;">THEN also, 
 the &#39;User Account has too many Failed Logins&#39; error is issued instead 
 of the &#39;Invalid User Id and/or Password&#39; error. </p>
<p style="margin-left: 48px;">WHEN the 
 Id is valid AND the Password is valid AND the Logon process has been successfully 
 completed</p>
<p style="margin-left: 88px;">THEN the 
 user&#39;s Failed Logon Count is reset to zero. Otherwise, the Failed Logon 
 Count will remain in effect for all future logon attempts. </p>
<p><font style="font-weight: bold;">Password Requires Both Alpha and Numeric</font><br/>
If you flag this field, users belonging to this Group must include at least 
 one numeric and one alphabetic character (a letter and a number) in their 
 passwords.</p>
