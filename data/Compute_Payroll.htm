<h1>Start Compute Payroll</h1>
<h2>Purpose:</h2>
<p>This function computes payroll for the specified Payroll Period. It 
 is required in order to run paychecks and direct deposit information.</p>
<h2>Usage:</h2>
<p>If <a href="Start_Compute_Overtime.htm">Compute Overtime</a> is implemented 
 at your firm, it should be run BEFORE Compute Payroll. See <a href="Compute_Payroll_and_Compute_Overtime.htm">Compute 
 Payroll and Compute Overtime</a> for the changes made to Compute Payroll 
 to support Compute Overtime.</p>
<p style="font-weight: bold;"><span style="font-weight: normal;">If 
 the GL Expense Account is completed in the Employee&#39;s Taxes Tab, this 
 function uses it to post to GL History instead of the GL Expense account 
 in the Tax Authority.</span>  </p>
<p style="margin-left: 48px;"><span style="font-weight: bold;">Note:</span> 
 the sys-compute-payroll registry PRExpenseAccount option trumps the 
 GL Expense Accounts on the Tax Authority and Employee Taxes tab.</p>
<p style="margin-left: 8px;">Compute Payroll 
 no longer generates Fringe Expense and Liability GL activity for fringes 
 that have been accrued so that Fringe-type Earnings may be marked as Accrue 
 in the Earnings record. Note that users who did not print/post Payroll 
 checks were always allowed to accrue the Fringes.</p>
<p style="margin-left: 8px;">Compute Payroll 
 supports the setting of the GL Entity Debit from the Job if the Earnings 
 Id&#39;s Entity is blank.</p>
<p style="margin-left: 8px;">Disposable 
 pay calculations for US and Canadian Payroll users where the <span style="font-weight: bold;">garnishment</span> 
 is a percentage of disposable pay are based on the settings of the Disposable 
 Income fields in the <a href="Deductions_Viewer.htm">Deductions</a> records. 
 </p>
<p>When Intercompany Processing is enabled, the GL Entity specified in 
 the Employee record provided the override for the Company/Security of 
 the post. </p>
<p>When using InterCompany in Version 
 9.1.611.053a and above, if an Employee&#39;s GL Entity is switched (on the 
 Employee record) to a different Company/Security during the calendar year, 
 Compute Payroll calculates payroll taxes with the correct annual limits 
 and tax amounts for the new company or companies if multiple company moves 
 are done during the year.  Tax types with annual limits include: 
  FUTA, SUTA &amp; FICA (SS &amp; MCAD). A registry setting is NOT 
 required to enable this default behavior when using InterCompany.  No 
 setting is required if Intercompany is NOT enabled.</p>
<p class="Support">​</p>
<p>This function will only be run for an employee if the Date Terminated 
 in the employee record is blank unless the Include Terminated Employees 
 box is checked .</p>
<p>When this function is run, payroll history is computed from the Labor 
 and Payroll Journals, and WO Labor tab so that payroll checks can be printed. 
 This history is not &#39;real&#39; until the paychecks are actually cut. If hours 
 are deleted from the labor journal (for example, if an employee quit and 
 his final paycheck was subject to negotiation), these hours are correctly 
 zeroed out when the function is run.</p>
<p><font style="font-weight: bold;">PR Checks</font> <font style="font-weight: bold;">in 
 a Multi-User Environment:</font> The system prevents users from doing 
 multiple simultaneous check runs for the same GL / Entity combination. 
 Compute Payroll ignores employees with in-use PR data (if a PR Check is 
 being run for that Employee, they will be skipped by Compute PR).</p>
<p><font style="font-weight: bold;">Bonus Checks:</font> Click <a href="Bonus_Payroll_Checks.htm">Bonus 
 Payroll Checks</a> for details.</p>






<p><font style="font-weight: bold;">Problems Posting PR</font> <font style="font-weight: bold;">Checks 
 – Employee Id and Name on</font> <font style="font-weight: bold;">Progress 
 Indicator<br/>
</font>In the event that a problem recurs when posting a large batch of 
 checks, the issue can most likely be resolved by <a data-target="POPUP643251367" data-rhwidget="DropSpot" href="#" class="dropspot"><span data-open-text="true" data-skip-index="true">following 
 these steps</span><span data-close-text="true">following 
 these steps</span></a>:</p>
<div data-targetname="POPUP643251367">
	<p>1. The user running the post acknowledges all error message prompts 
	 being sure to note which employee is specified on the progress indicated 
	 when the post fails.<br/>
	2. The user next logs completely out of SAMPRO to ensure a rollback 
	 of partially posted data.<br/>
	3. The user should rerun the PR Checks without the &#39;offending&#39; employee 
	 and print and post them.<br/>
	4. The PR Check for the &#39;offending&#39; employee should be printed and 
	 posted.</p></div>
<p><font style="font-weight: bold;">Fringe Expenses Flagged as Job Cost 
 PR Check in the Earnings Viewer</font></p>
<p>1. When the fringe is being charged to an overhead job, the GL Account 
 is the debit account from the fringe Earnings record.</p>
<p>2. When the job is not an overhead job AND the &#39;PRExpenseAccount&#39; registry 
 entry is set, then the registry entry specifies the GL Account to use.</p>
<p>3. When all else fails, the GL Expense Account from the Cost Category 
 is used.</p>
<p><font style="font-weight: bold;">Percent of Wage PTO Accruals</font></p>
<p>SAMPro supports the calculation of percent-of-wage PTO earnings accruals. <a data-target="POPUP643190216" data-rhwidget="DropSpot" href="#" class="dropspot"><span data-open-text="true" data-skip-index="true">Click 
 for details.</span><span data-close-text="true">Click 
 for details.</span></a></p>
<div data-targetname="POPUP643190216">
	<p>It is triggered by the Employee PTO line having the Percent field 
	 filled in.  The percentage is applied to the employee&#39;s 
	 Modified Gross Wages for the period.  Modified Gross Wages 
	 are defined as the employee&#39;s gross wages less any wages classified 
	 as the same Pay Type Category (i.e. &#39;Vacation&#39;) as the PTO.</p>
	<p>In other words, don&#39;t accrue vacation earnings against vacation 
	 being paid out.  The key to this is matching up the Pay 
	 Type Category selections. The resulting calculations are stored in 
	 the PRH Hours table&#39;s Earnings Accrued field.  A new field 
	 has been added to PRH Hours to store the Percent captured from the 
	 Employee PTO line at the time of the compute. </p></div>
<p style="font-weight: bold;">Use It or 
 Lose It PTO</p>
<p>Compute Payroll supports PTO based 
 on a Annual Maximum Balance (or Cap) for companies with a “Use it or Lose 
 it” PTO policy. When Compute Payroll is run, the accrued hours may be 
 limited so that the Max Hours cap (specified on the Max Hours field of 
 the Employee&#39;s Paid Time Off tab) is not exceeded. If PTO hours are &#39;lost&#39; 
 to the Max Hours cap being exceeded, the hours and earning lost will be 
 written to the PTO Hours Lost and PTO Earning Lost in Payroll History.</p>

<h2>Important Fields:</h2>
<p><font style="font-weight: bold;">Pay Period Id:</font><br/>
Enter the Payroll Period to be computed. This period must be Active.</p>
<p><font style="font-weight: bold;">Accrue PTO Hours?</font><br/>
If Paid Time Off is implemented on your system, be sure to review the status 
 of this display field; it must be checked (in the Payroll Period record) 
 in order for PTO Time Off to be accrued when the compute is run. If the 
 Accrue PTO Hours field is blank, Paid Time Off hours will not be accrued 
 during the compute (e.g., for bonus pay). Note that the PTO accrual will 
 only take place if the Start and End dates of the payroll period intersect 
 with the Start and End Dates in the PTO tab of the Employee record.</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: bold;">Deduction 
 Cycles:</span><br/>
This display field shows the default Deduction Cycles specified in the 
 selected Payroll Period.</p>
<p><font style="font-weight: bold;">Paid Time Off: Accrue?</font> <font style="font-weight: bold;">(Canadian Customizations Only)<br/>
</font>PTO accruals are calculated during the Compute PR process and are 
 subject to the Accrue PTO flag from the Pay Period record.  Some 
 special situations can be controlled by creating special Pay Periods and 
 not selecting the Accrue PTO option.  A Christmas Bonus payroll 
 would be one such example. In other situations it might be more beneficial 
 to have Accrue PTO selected in the Pay Period but have the option to override 
 it during the Compute PR process.  This field (for Canadian 
 customers only) allows an override of the Pay Period&#39;s Accrue PTO option. </p>
<p><font style="font-weight: bold;">Deduction Cycles to Include:</font><br/>
This field defaults from the Deduction 
 Cycles field in the Payroll Period. Enter the Deduction 
 Cycles (y,m,p, etc.) to include in the compute. Deduction Cycle information 
 is maintained in the Deductions Group record (for union payroll) and the 
 Employee Deduction tab (non-union). A deduction will not be taken unless 
 its cycle is specified.</p>
<p><font style="font-weight: bold;">Terminated Employees: Include?</font><br/>
This field must be checked to allow payroll to be completed for employees 
 whose Terminated Date has been set.</p>
<p><font style="font-weight: bold;">Employee Id:</font><br/>
To compute payroll for all eligible employees, leave this field blank. 
 To compute payroll for a specific employee, enter his Id. A series of 
 employees can be specified by listing Employee Id&#39;s separated by commas: 
 1001,1005,1025.</p>
<p><font style="font-weight: bold;">Branch Id:<br/>
</font> If you only wish to compute payroll for a specific Branch, enter 
 the Id. Several branches can be specified by listing Id&#39;s separated by 
 commas: 1001,1005,1025.</p>
<p>Compute Payroll supports the Hard Block 
 logic (implemented by the BranchFilterWithHardBlock global settings registry 
 option) in this version.  The Hard Block is maintained regardless 
 of how the Branch filter range is set.</p>
