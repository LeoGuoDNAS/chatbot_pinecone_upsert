<h1>New Call Viewer</h1>
<h2>Purpose:</h2>
<p>Enables the user to quickly create a new work order.</p>
<h2>Example:</h2>
<p>When a customer calls in with a service request, the dispatcher selects 
 the site and equipment, records the new call information and then saves 
 the call with the Add Record button to create a work order. The new call 
 is automatically added to the Dispatch Board, and the dispatcher is given 
 the option of printing the work order.</p>
<h2>Registry Entries:</h2>
<p><a href="Registry_Entry_for_New_Call_Options.htm">Registry Entry for 
 New Call Options</a> including entries to write service tasks/parts list 
 to the work order, automate the display of the Master Contract pane, <span>clear 
 the default Tech</span> and many more.</p>
<p>The <a href="Registry_New_Call_Service_Category.htm">Registry New Call 
 Service Category</a> may be implemented to warn the user of excessive 
 activity for the selected site by Service Category.</p>
<p>Specify fields as Required or Disabled in the <a href="Registry_New_Call_Required_Disable.htm">Registry 
 Entry sys-start-snwcll</a>.</p>
<p>This registry entry may override the default status of work orders by 
 Technician Web Access: <a href="Internal_Registry_Entry_Web_Access.htm">Registry 
 Entry Web Access</a> .</p>
<p>See <a href="Registry_Entry_Global_Settings__Column_Compression__Dispatch_Board_Rows__History_Log_Inventory_Markup.htm#global_settings_auto_gen_weblogs_to_WOs">Auto-Generate 
 Work Orders from Web Logs</a> for details on implementing this functionality.</p>
<h2>Usage:</h2>
<p>When Intercompany Processing is enabled, the Job GL Entity specified 
 in the selected Job will determine the Work Order’s Company/Security.</p>
<p><img src="assets/images/image/SKIN1_NewCall2.gif" alt="image\SKIN1_NewCall2.gif" title="image\SKIN1_NewCall2.gif" width="94" height="28" border="0"/> The New Call 2 Screen will 
 appear when New Call is launched if a registry setting is enabled. For 
 detailed Help on New Call 2, click <a href="New_Call_2.htm">New Call 2</a> 
 .</p>
<p><img src="assets/images/image/SKIN1_NewCall.gif" alt="image\SKIN1_NewCall.gif" title="image\SKIN1_NewCall.gif" width="63" height="35" border="0"/> Click this button to toggle 
 back to the original New Call screen. If the call is for an established 
 client site, select the appropriate Client Site and Equipment from the 
 lists in the lower section of the screen (as discussed below).</p>
<p><img src="assets/images/image/SKIN1_NewClientSite.gif" alt="" style="border: none;" border="0"/>  If no record exists for Equipment at this 
 Site, select the Client Site and then click the Flashlight button to access 
 the create mode: <a href="New_Call_Create_New_Client_Site_Equipment_Viewer.htm">New 
 Call (New Client Site)</a>.  Although the create mode may also be 
 used to create Client and Client Site records, the <a href="Clone_Job_Wizard.htm">Clone 
 Job Wizard</a> is highly recommended for the initial creation of commercial 
 client, site, equipment and job records.</p>
<p><img src="assets/images/SKIN1_RR.bmp" alt="" style="border: none;" border="0"/>  <font style="font-family: Tahoma;" face="Tahoma">If</font> <font style="font-family: Tahoma;" face="Tahoma">WO Materials Requisitioning is implemented</font> <font style="font-family: Tahoma;" face="Tahoma">this button will be en</font>abled 
 to enable the addition of required resources (inventory items and flat 
 rates). See <a href="New_Call_Required_Resources.htm">New Call Required 
 Resources</a> .</p>
<p>Call sequencing is disabled when no tech has been assigned to a work 
 order created in New Call.</p>
<h2>Screen Organization:</h2>
<h3>Upper Portion of New Call – Data Entry</h3>
<p>The <font style="font-weight: bold;">upper portion of the screen</font> 
 contains data-entry fields for the Work Order. The lower portion of the 
 screen is divided into three scrollable lists.</p>
<h3>Middle Portion of New Call – Site List</h3>
<p>The list in the middle portion of the screen displays Client Sites; 
 click on a Site to select it.</p>
<p><img src="assets/images/image/SKIN1_showMCP.gif" alt="image\SKIN1_showMCP.gif" title="image\SKIN1_showMCP.gif" width="94" height="28" border="0"/>  This sidebar button 
 toggles the display between the Client Site (middle) pane and the Master 
 Contract pane. A Client Site must be selected before clicking the button. 
 The Master Contract pane displays all Contracts associate with the selected 
 Site. Contracts are listed in descending order of the Master Contract 
 Date End. Doubling-clicking on a Contract opens the Master Contract record. 
 A registry entry may be used to automate the Master Contract display.</p>
<p>If Notes exist for the selected Client Site, the system will ask if 
 you wish to view the Notes. Select Yes to view the notes.</p>
<p>When a Site is selected, the system attempts to determine which Client 
 it is associated with in order to check the AR Balance and Aging either 
 of the client or of a specific site associated with the client (if the 
 registry option EnableNewCallClientSiteARAnalysis is enabled).</p>





<p>The system checks the AR status by comparing the New Call AR Warning 
 Days field (in the Client record) against the actual age of the Client&#39;s 
 receivables. If the age of the receivables exceeds the value of the New 
 Call AR Warning Days field, the system will automatically display the 
 aging summary for this Client. <font style="font-weight: bold;">Note that 
 this warning is only displayed once per Client each time you start up 
 New Call</font>.</p>
<p style="margin-left: 36.00pt;"><font style="font-weight: bold;">Credit 
 Hold Sites:</font> If the Site’s status is set to Credit Hold, the system 
 will alert the user and the WO will be marked as on Credit Hold – see 
 ‘Credit Hold Warning’ (below) for details on handling Credit Hold Work 
 Orders.</p>
<p>Trip and other additional charges will be automatically defaulted into 
 the Other tab of the work order if they are specified on the WO Other 
 tab of the selected Client Site. The charges will automatically be posted 
 to job history.</p>
<h3>Lower Right-hand Section - Work Order History</h3>
<p>The <font style="font-weight: bold;">lower right-hand list displays 
 Work Order History</font> for that site (this will be filtered to Equipment 
 when you select an Equipment record). Open Work Orders (with the Date 
 Closed blank) will appear at the top of the Work Order History list when 
 you select a Site or Equipment record. Work Orders are sorted by Date 
 Closed (with &lt;&lt;Open&gt;&gt; work orders listed first), and then 
 by Equipment Id, and WO Id - all in descending order. Note that one line 
 will be shown for each technician / equipment line associated with the 
 Work Order. The Work Code displayed in this pane represents the Work Code 
 on the WO&#39;s Equipment tab.</p>
<p class="MsoNormal" style="margin-bottom: .0001pt; line-height: normal; 
	 mso-layout-grid-align: none; text-autospace: none; font-size: 10.0pt; 
	 font-family: Arial, sans-serif;">Note that the Closed date in this 
 pane is from the Work Order Date Closed which may have be set when the 
 WO was completed or billed. The Scheduled date is from the Tech line itself. 
  </p>
<p class="MsoNormal" style="margin-bottom: .0001pt; line-height: normal; 
	 mso-layout-grid-align: none; text-autospace: none; font-size: 10.0pt; 
	 font-family: Arial, sans-serif;">Archived Work Orders (with a Work 
 Order Status Category of Archived) are now excluded from the New Call 
 WO list in SAMPro. This was done to improve the performance of New 
 Call, especially when displaying Sites with significant history.  </p>
<p class="MsoNormal" style="margin-bottom: .0001pt; line-height: normal; 
	 mso-layout-grid-align: none; text-autospace: none; font-size: 10.0pt; 
	 font-family: Arial, sans-serif; margin-left: 48px;"><span style="font-weight: bold;">Reminder 
 on Archiving:</span><span><br/>
The Start Archive Work or Start Autoarchive Work Order functions may be 
 used to Archive Work Orders. A Work Order may also be set to a Work Order 
 Status Category of Archived by adding a Technician Line with a status 
 of Archived; when the Work Order is saved the Status Category will be 
 reset to Archived. A Work Order is &#39;unarchived&#39; by deleting the Tech line 
 set to Archived and saving the Work Order. </span></p>
<p class="Reference_Line" style="margin-bottom: 0.00pt;">Double-click on 
 a line to view that work order.</p>
<h3>Lower Left-hand Section: Equipment List</h3>
<p>The <font style="font-weight: bold;">lower left-hand list displays the 
 active Equipment for that site</font>; click on an Equipment Id to select 
 it. When you do so the system may display a call script or credit hold 
 warning, as discussed below.</p>
<p style="margin-left: 36.00pt;"><font style="font-weight: bold;">Credit 
 Hold Warning<br/>
</font>When you select a piece of Equipment for a Site, the system will 
 check the Job referenced in the Equipment. If any receivables for the 
 Client associated with this Job exceed the Credit Hold Days (in the Client 
 record), the system will display the number of days overdue, and warn 
 you that the work order will be placed on Credit Hold. If a work order 
 is placed on credit hold:</p>
<p style="margin-left: 66.25pt;">It will not be visible on the dispatch 
 board AT ALL (like archived)</p>
<p style="margin-left: 66.25pt;">The WO cannot not be changed AT ALL except 
 by credit managers</p>
<p style="margin-left: 66.25pt;">The credit manager will be able to filter 
 the view work order list for only WO&#39;s on credit hold</p>
<p style="margin-left: 66.25pt;">The credit manager can remove the Credit 
 Hold status by clearing the Credit Hold box</p>
<p class="Reference_Line" style="margin-left: 36.00pt; margin-bottom: 0.00pt;">If 
 Escalation Management is implemented on your system, you may want to create 
 an escalation event that would notify the credit manager that there is 
 a work order on credit hold to review.</p>
<p><font style="font-weight: bold;">Call Scripting<br/>
</font>When you select a piece of Equipment or a Work Code in New Call 
 that has a Call Script associated with it, the Call Script Wizard screen 
 will appear. The Questions in the Call Script will appear on the left 
 and lines for Response will appear on the right. After you have completed 
 the Responses, tab once more or click the CS Wizard button on the side 
 button bar to return to the New Call screen. The Questions and Responses 
 will be included on the Work Order when you save it.</p>
<h2>Important Fields: Upper Section</h2>
<p><font style="font-weight: bold;">Search Text:</font><br/>
Enter a text string in the Search Text field and then press [Enter]. SAM 
 Pro will compare this text with the Alphanumeric Id of the Client Site. 
 If the Search Text matches the text in a Client Site record, SAM Pro will 
 include that client site in the revised listing.</p>
<p>If you decide that your site/equipment selections were not correct and 
 enter a different search string, all fields except the (Service Category) 
 that were previously completed will be automatically cleared in preparation 
 for selecting a new Site and Equipment record.</p>
<p><font style="font-weight: bold;">Use Wild Card Search</font><br/>
If this field is blank, SAM Pro will only search the first characters starting 
 at the extreme left-hand side of the field. If checked, the system will 
 search for the text string you enter globally within the search field.</p>
<p><font style="font-weight: bold;">Alpha  Phone  Street  Name 
  Id</font> <font style="font-weight: bold;">Any<br/>
</font>By default, SAM Pro compares the Search Text you entered with the 
 data in the Client Site Alpha field. However, by selecting one of the 
 other radio buttons (by double-clicking or pressing the Spacebar), you 
 have the option of searching for Client Sites based on their Name, ID, 
 phone number, or street.</p>
<p>The Any option causes the system to check <font style="text-decoration: underline; ">all</font> 
 of the following Client Site fields (unless specific SearchColumns are 
 specified in a registry entry) for the specified search text:</p>
<p style="margin-left: 36.00pt;">Client Site Id, Alpha, Name, Street Shipping 
 Address<br/>
Client Site Voice Phone, Contact 1 Phone, Contact 2 Phone</p>
<p style="margin-left: 36.00pt;"><font style="font-weight: bold; text-decoration: underline; ">Example</font> 
 <font style="text-decoration: underline; "><br/>
</font>Assume that the Alpha search option is selected. If you search for 
 the text <font style="font-weight: bold;">st</font> when the Use Wild 
 Card Search is not checked, the system would locate a record with the 
 Alpha field Stevens; however, an Alpha field of Faust would not be considered 
 a match. However, if you check the Use Wild Card Search box, the system 
 would consider both Stevens and Faust to be matches.</p>
<p><font style="font-weight: bold;">Original Caller:</font><br/>
This field lists the person who called in this Work Order. It defaults 
 from the Contact 1 First and Last Name fields in the Client Site record 
 (if completed); if these field are not completed it will default from 
 the Client Site Contact 2 information. This field may be changed by the 
 user; it will be written to the Work Order&#39;s Original Caller field.</p>
<p><font style="font-weight: bold;">Market Source:</font><br/>
Defaults from the Client referenced in the Job, or the Client Site (if 
 blank in the Job’s Client record) but may be changed by the user to track 
 the success of marketing campaigns that generated specific work orders. 
 For example, the Site may have been generated by a customer reference, 
 but this particular work order was generated by the spring coupon mailing.</p>
<p><font style="font-weight: bold;">Service Category:<br/>
</font>If this field is completed, it will filter the Work Code list to 
 those associated with this service category. The system will filter the 
 Site Equipment list to show Equipment for the selected Category, plus 
 Site Equipment that hasn&#39;t been classified into a Service Category.</p>
<p>This field may be set by entering a Service Category Id or by selecting 
 a piece of Equipment associated with this Service Category. The filtering 
 of Equipment by selecting the Service Category may be disabled by the 
 <a href="Registry_Entry_for_New_Call_Options.htm">Registry Entry for New 
 Call Options</a> .</p>
<p><font style="font-weight: bold;">Work Code:</font><br/>
The Work Code Name and Estimated Hours fields are set from the Work Code 
 record. This field is optional. If you select a Work Code with an assigned 
 Call Script, the system will immediately prompt you to respond to the 
 Call Script questions.</p>
<p>If PCR functionality is enabled, the system will validate the Work Code 
 is specified in the PCR Table (in the Client Site / Client Site Equipment) 
 when a Work Code is entered or changed. If a PCR Table is specified in 
 the Client Site Equipment record, it overrides the PCR Table in the Client 
 Site record.</p>
<p><font style="font-weight: bold;">Tech Finder Button<br/>
</font><img src="assets/images/image/SKIN1_TechFinder.gif" alt="" style="border: none;" border="0"/>  This button launches the TechFinder screen 
 to help you assign the call to the optimal technician and best date. This 
 button should be clicked after the Site and Equipment have been selected. 
 This feature works in conjunction with Certifications: if the Equipment 
 selected includes a Certification Id, only those technicians with a matching 
 Certification will be listed when the TechFinder viewer appears. Click 
 <a href="TechFinder_Viewer.htm">TechFinder Viewer</a> for details.</p>
<p><font style="font-weight: bold;">Estimated Hours</font><br/>
This field defaults from the Work Code but may be modified by the user.</p>
<p><font style="font-weight: bold;">Priority:</font><br/>
The priority level for this call. Zero (0) is the highest priority (most 
 critical), and 9 the lowest (least critical)</p>
<p><font style="font-weight: bold;">Date Scheduled:</font><br/>
Enter the date in <font style="font-style: italic;">MMDDYYYY</font> format; 
 double-click to open the calendar; or press the Spacebar to enter the 
 current date.</p>
<p style="margin-left: 36.00pt;"><font style="font-weight: bold;">Tech 
 Unavailability</font><font style="font-weight: bold;">:</font> If this 
 feature is enabled and the Tech is Unavailable for this day, a Warning 
 will appear saying the Tech is Unavailable when the New Call is saved.</p>
<p><font style="font-weight: bold;">Time Scheduled:</font><br/>
Enter the scheduled time for this call in 24-hour or military format or 
 double-click on this field to access the Clock Viewer to do so. Alternately, 
 press the Spacebar to enter the current time.</p>
<p style="margin-left: 36.00pt;"><font style="font-weight: bold;">NOTE:</font> 
 The Date and Time fields are optional; the date also be set from the Dispatch 
 Board or TechFinder. If you do not enter a date, it will automatically 
 default to January 1, 1900 (unless the default date is specified in the 
 <a href="Registry_Entry_for_New_Call_Options.htm">Registry Entry for New 
 Call Options</a> ).</p>
<p><font style="font-weight: bold;">PO Required</font><br/>
An &#39;x&#39; will appear in this information only field if a PO is required for 
 this Client Site.</p>
<p><font style="font-weight: bold;">PO Number:</font><br/>
If the PO Required field is flagged (contains an &#39;x&#39;), enter the Client&#39;s 
 PO number in this optional field. A <a href="Registry_Entry_for_New_Call_Options.htm#Registry_Newcall_Set_PO_from_Default_Service_Job">Registry 
 Setting</a> may be enabled to default this field from the selected Equipment&#39;s 
 Default Service Job.</p>
<p><font style="font-weight: bold;">Technician Id:</font><br/>
This field defaults from the Client Site Equipment record <span>(unless 
 disabled via <a href="Registry_Entry_for_New_Call_Options.htm#Clear_Default_Tech_When_Selecting_Equipment">Registry</a>)</span>, 
 and is used to assign a technician to this work order. Unless this field 
 is required by customization/registry setting, the technician may be assigned 
 from the dispatch board.</p>
<p style="margin-left: 36.00pt;"><font style="font-weight: bold;">Subcontractor 
 Technicians:<br/>
</font>If the Technician you selected references a Vendor Id AND has the 
 Web Access set to Subcontractor on the Remote Access tab, a Purchase Order 
 will also be generated.</p>
<p style="margin-left: 36.00pt;"><span>You will not be allowed to select 
 a Sub Tech whose required insurance is out of date and Block Purchases 
 is flagged in their Vendor / Tech record. </span></p>
<p style="margin-left: 48px;"><span>For SubAnywhere techs, the PO will 
 be set to Unreleased to conform to SubAnywhere requirements. To be considered 
 a SubAnywhere tech, the Technician record must also have the Remote Device 
 Type set to the option of SubAnywhere.</span></p>
<p><font style="font-weight: bold;">Call Sequence:<br/>
</font>The sequence number for the new work order (used by the Classic 
 board to determine the order in which the Technician should attend to 
 his work orders on a given day). If you do not set the call sequence, 
 the system will attempt to derive an appropriate call sequence number 
 based on the Time Scheduled and the Technician assigned to the Work Order. 
 In the case of ties, the original work order will retain its original 
 sequence number. See <a href="Registry_Entry_for_New_Call_Options.htm">Registry 
 Entry for New Call Options</a> for a registry entry to alter this behavior.</p>
<p><font style="font-weight: bold;">Original WO:<br/>
</font>If this Work Order is being created as a Call Back, enter the original 
 WO Id in this field or right-click on it in the lower right-hand (Work 
 Order list) pane with the caret <font style="font-weight: bold;">not</font> 
 on this field. When you do so, the system will ask you to confirm that 
 this work order is being created as a Call Back for the Work Order that 
 you select. If you click &#39;Yes&#39;, the system will insert the appropriate 
 Work Order Id, and set the Work Order Type to Call Back.</p>
<p><font style="font-weight: bold;">Branch Id</font>:<br/>
The Branch this work order is assigned to. See <a href="Branch_Processing_in_New_Call.htm">Branch 
 Processing in New Call</a> for details.</p>
<p><font style="font-weight: bold;">Work Order Name:</font><br/>
This optional field may be used to describe the Work Order or add other 
 pertinent information. If this field is left blank, it defaults from the 
 Work Code Name when the work order is created. This field well be listed 
 on the Power Board.</p>
<p><font style="font-weight: bold;">Web Log Id:</font><br/>
Web Logs are requests for service that may be created by a Client, a Technician 
 (from TechAnywhere), or a Service Provider.</p>
<p style="margin-left: 48px;"><span style="font-weight: bold;">FMMS Web 
 Logs:</span><br/>
Web Logs may also be generated by FMMS companies such as ServiceChannel.<span> 
 In this case, the NTE amount from the selected Service Request now defaults 
 to the NTE Client field which will populate the corresponding field in the 
 newly created Work Order.</span></p>
<p style="margin-left: 48px;">A special pick list option will be offered 
 FMMS users when selecting a web log from NewCall. If FMMS is enabled, 
 the user is prompted to &quot;Show Special FMMS Only List?&quot;. Clicking 
 No will pull up the usual list (with FMMS and other weblogs). Clicking 
 Yes will pull up the new list, which is tailored for clients using FMMS. 
 It displays the following information:</p>
<p style="margin-left: 88px;">Web Log ID - Web Log Date - FMMS Vendor - 
 Site ID if known - FMMS Site/Location - FMMS Request </p>
<p style="margin-left: 48px;"><span style="font-weight: bold;">Web Logs 
 from TechAnywhere</span><br/>
When a Weblog from TechAnywhere is entered, a wizard displaying the Weblog 
 information will appear. The following buttons allow you to process the 
 Weblog as follows:</p>
<p style="margin-left: 88px;"><span style="font-weight: bold;">Proceed:</span>  Clicking 
 this button will use this Weblog to create a new Work Order. The contents 
 will load into NewCall to allow the dispatcher to finish creating the 
 new Work Order.</p>
<p style="margin-left: 88px;"><span style="font-weight: bold;">Decline:</span> 
  Gives the user the opportunity to change a Weblog to the status 
 of ‘Cancelled’ to remove it from the list of New/Unacknowledged Weblogs.</p>
<p style="margin-left: 88px;"><span style="font-weight: bold;">AssignToWO:</span> 
 Click this button to select an existing Work Order to assign this Weblog 
 to. The Weblog’s Equipment and Work Requested contents will be added to 
 the Work Order&#39;s Equipment Tab. The Weblog will also be changed to Acknowledged 
 and reference the selected Work Order.</p>
<p style="margin-left: 88px;"><span style="font-weight: bold;">Cancel:</span><span> 
 Returns you to the New Call with the weblog field cleared. It only cancels 
 the operation of selecting the Weblog; it does NOT set the Weblog&#39;s status 
 to Cancelled. Note: Pressing the X works the same as the Cancel button.</span></p>
<p>To create a work order from a web log, enter its Id (or double-click 
 to select from a list) and tab out of the field.</p>
<p>The Client Site, service category, work code and work requested fields 
 will default from the web log. Select the appropriate Equipment Id and 
 complete any remaining fields as needed. When a Web Log with the Equipment 
 Id set from TechAnywhere is processed, it does not automatically select 
 the Equipment.</p>
<p style="margin-left: 36.00pt;"><font style="font-weight: bold;">Important 
 Note on</font> <font style="font-weight: bold;">Multiple</font> <font style="font-weight: bold;">Web Logs:</font><br/>

 will be defaulted as follows from the </font>Client Site Equipment - Client

 Work Order.</span> </p>
<p class="Tip_Note_Heading" style="margin-top: 4.00pt;">Type:</p>
<p style="margin-left: 36.00pt;"><font style="font-weight: bold;">Service:</font> 
 By default, Work Orders created in New Call are set to Service.</p>
<p style="margin-left: 36.00pt;"><font style="font-weight: bold;">PreventiveMaint:</font> 
 Normally, you would not select this Type for work orders created in New 
 Call. Work orders generated by Create PM WorkOrders are assigned this 
 Type. If select this type, the Service Tasks and Parts lists specified 
 on the Equipment Service Tab will added to the Work Order Equipment tab.</p>
<p style="margin-left: 36.00pt;"><font style="font-weight: bold;">CSR:</font> 
 Obsolete.</p>

<p style="margin-left: 36.00pt;"><font style="font-weight: bold;">Installation, 
 Estimate, Other, Call Back:</font> one of these Types may be selected 
 for informational purposes to better identify the work order.</p>
<p style="margin-left: 36.00pt;"><font style="font-weight: bold;">PM Invoice:</font> 
 Do not select this Type for work orders created in New Call; it is reserved 
 for PM Billings only.</p>
<p style="margin-left: 36.00pt;"><font style="font-weight: bold;">Material 
 Direct:</font> The Type would be selected to record the ‘sale’ of a purchased 
 item to a client and the client&#39;s invoice will come directly from the 
 vendor from whom the item was purchased (instead of generating the invoice 
 in SAMPro). In this case, the WO Status Category will be set to ‘Archived’ 
 instead of ‘Completed’ when the Escalation Status is set to ‘Completed’.</p>
<p style="margin-left: 36.00pt;"><font style="font-weight: bold;">Quote:</font> 
 no longer has any special meaning, and is used for informational purposes 
 only.</p>
<p style="margin-left: 36.00pt;"><span style="font-weight: bold;">Requisition:</span> 
 &quot;Requisition&quot; should be used ONLY for the purpose of requisitioning 
 materials for installation / construction jobs and should not be used 
 for service or PM work orders. When the Work Order is specified as Requisition, 
 running Start Tech (Work Order) Material Pickup creates a Loc-to-Job transfer 
 instead of transferring the materials to a location (typically, the Tech&#39;s 
 truck).</p>
<p><font style="font-weight: bold;">Override Tech Status:</font><font style="font-weight: bold;"><br/>
</font>By default, this field is set to the value ‘ default’: the technician 
 status will be set to the appropriate value for that type of technician 
 (referring to the sys-web-access and other registry entries, if present). 
 The ‘ ‘ blank Override Tech Status is processed the same way as ‘ default’ 
 if the field is accidentally cleared.</p>
<p>To select a special status (e.g., Return Trip), double-click this field 
 (or click the Magnify button) to display a list of valid statuses to select 
 from. By default, all statuses will be displayed, but a registry entry 
 may made to control the contents of the list: <a href="Registry_Entry_for_New_Call_Options.htm">Registry 
 New Call (sys-newcall)</a> .</p>
<p><font style="font-weight: bold;">Show Records for: Active All Inactive</font><br/>
This field enables you to select whether to display Active, All or Inactive 
 Client Sites on the New Call viewer. By default, Active is selected so 
 only active Sites (and their active equipment will appear on the list). 
 To display All or only Inactive Sites, double-click on the appropriate 
 radio button. <font style="font-weight: bold;">Note that work orders cannot 
 be created for Inactive sites.</font></p>
<p><font style="font-weight: bold;">NTE Client: NTE Sub:<br/>
</font>These fields default from the Client Site (unless they are superceded 
 by the values from the Client Site Equipment record) but may be changed 
 by the user if necessary. The NTE Sub field is used in conjunction to 
 limit autogenerated PO&#39;s to this dollar value.</p>
<p><font style="font-weight: bold;">Log Form Id:</font><br/>
This field defaults from the Equipment record, but may be changed by the 
 user to select which log form id (for work order metrics) will be specified 
 on the new work order&#39;s Equipment tab, and be used to which metrics will 
 appear on the Metrics tab.</p>
<p style="margin-left: 36.00pt;"><font style="font-weight: bold;">Important:</font> 
 when a work order referencing a log form is created in SAMPro, metrics 
 are only written to the  metrics tab if the Technician is not a TechAnywhere 
 Tech or no Tech is specified. If the work order initially assigned to 
 a technician with remote access, metrics will be uploaded to the technician’s 
 device, and then posted to the work order when they have been completed 
 in the field.</p>
<p><font style="font-weight: bold;">Payment Type:<br/>
</font>Typically used to record how the client says they will pay (Cash, 
 Check, Account, CreditCard, etc.).</p>
<p class="Tip_Note_Heading" style="margin-top: 4.00pt;">Default</p>
<p style="margin-left: 36.00pt;"><font style="font-weight: bold;">Job Id: 
  Job Cost Code Id:  Job Billing Item Id:</font><br/>
These fields will be filled in from the Equipment record&#39;s Default Job 
 fields, but may be changed if needed. When you blank the Job Id or select 
 a different Job Id, the Job Cost Code and Billing Items will be blanked 
 so that they can be easily re-entered. The Job should refer to the Site 
 selected in New Call unless special processing for certain Utility or 
 Warranty Jobs is in effect. <span>See <a href="Registry_Entry_for_New_Call_Options.htm#Specify_Default_Service_Job_Selection_Filter_Override">Registry 
 to Specify Default Service Job Selection Filter Override</a> for details.</span></p>
<p style="margin-left: 8px; font-weight: bold;"><span>Master Contract Id: 
 </span><span style="font-weight: normal; font-style: italic;">(requires 
 special v.cus file)<br/>
</span><span style="font-weight: normal;">If the selected Equipment is 
 associated with a Master Contract that is currently open or will be open 
 in the future, the Master Contract Id is added to the Work Order 
 header to support custom reporting/analysis of full service contracts. 
 </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: bold;">Email Address:</span><br/>
When a Site is selected, the Client Site&#39;s Email field is defaulted to 
 the Work Order Email Address field. The user may manually update this 
 field if desired before adding the Work Order. Escalations for the new Notification 
 Source &#39;Work Order&#39; will be sent to this address. The Email address for 
 the Scheduled Events is set when the WO is generated. Changing it in the 
 Work Order after creation will not propagate the change to the Events 
 themselves.</p>


<p><font style="font-weight: bold;">Client Id: Client Name:</font> <font style="font-weight: bold;"><br/>
</font>The Client Id and Name from the Default Service Job. The following 
 logic derive the Default Service Job / Client:</p>
<p style="margin-left: 36.00pt;">When the Site is selected, look at the 
 Equipment records: if their Service Jobs all point to the same Client, 
 display that Client.</p>
<p style="margin-left: 36.00pt;">When the Equipment is selected, check 
 that Equipment’s Default Service Job and display its Client.</p>
<p style="margin-left: 36.00pt;">If the selected Equipment has no Default 
 Service Job, display the Client from the Job that the user selects.</p>
<p><font style="font-weight: bold;">Client Site Id:  Client Site Name: 
 Equipment Id:  Equipment Name:<br/>
Contact:  Site Address:</font><br/>
These informational fields are filled in from the Client Site and Equipment 
 records.</p>
