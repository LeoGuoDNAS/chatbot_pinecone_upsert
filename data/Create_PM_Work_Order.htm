<h1>Create PM Work Order</h1>
<h2>Purpose:</h2>
<p>This function generates PM Work Orders. These PM&#39;s may be generated 
 directly from the Site Equipment PM Schedule tab or from the Master Contract 
 Schedule tab.</p>
<p>Validation prevents multiple users from updating the same records with 
 this function.</p>

<h2>Reports:</h2>
<p>See <a href="Report_PM_Work_Orders.htm">Report PM Work Orders</a> for 
 information on this predictor report: it evaluates the Master Contract 
 data and the data residing in the Site Equipment PM Schedule, and lists 
 what PM Work Orders will be created when Start Create PM WorkOrders is 
 run.</p>
<h2>Usage:</h2>
<p><span><u style="text-decoration: none; ">When</u></span><span> the UseMasterContractEquipmentTable 
 global registry set to true, this function assigns total estimated hours 
 and TOS$ to the first Equipment record (by ID) on each Master Contract-based 
 PM that includes multiple Equipment. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: bold;">Combining PMs:</span> SAMPro uses a 
 grouping order to determine whether or not PM Schedule lines will be combined 
 on a single PM Work Order. <span style="font-weight: bold;">See <a href="PM_WO_Grouping.htm" style="font-weight: bold;">PM WO Grouping</a> for important details.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: bold;">Site / Equipment / Job Status:</span> 
 This function is sensitive to the status of the Site and the Job Date 
 Closed in order to exclude undesirable PM Inspections from creation. The 
 following validations apply:</p>
<p style="margin-left: 36.00pt;">1. If the Site is not Active or Credit 
 Hold, do not create PM Work Orders for it. Sites with a <span style="font-weight: bold;">future</span> 
 Date Closed will not be skipped, even if it is flagged as Inactive. </p>
<p style="margin-left: 36.00pt;">PM Work Orders that are created for Credit 
 Hold Sites will be flagged as Credit Hold, and must be released by a Credit 
 Manager.</p>
<p style="margin-left: 36.00pt;">2. If the Job in the Equipment PM schedule 
 has a Job Date Closed that precedes the Inspection Date, do not create 
 a PM Work Order for it. Inactive Sites and Closed Jobs are skipped in 
 the Master Contract processing phase; lines will not be written to the 
 Client Site Equipment PM Schedule.</p>
<p style="margin-left: 36.00pt;">3. Equipment must be <font style="font-weight: bold;">active</font> 
 (e.g., Equipment whose Inactive field is not checked).</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: bold;">Assigned Technician:</span> When the 
 Start Create PM WorkOrder function is run, the system will attempt to 
 assign a technician to the PM Work Order based on the following rules:</p>
<p style="margin-left: 23.75pt;"><font style="font-family: Symbol;" face="Symbol">-</font> 
 Use the Tech from the PM Schedule.<br/>
<font style="font-family: Symbol;" face="Symbol">-</font> If no Tech is 
 listed on the PM Schedule, use the default technician from the Equipment 
 record.<br/>
<font style="font-family: Symbol;" face="Symbol">-</font> If no technician 
 is listed on the PM Schedule, or in Equipment record, use the technician 
 in the Client Site record.<br/>
- Use the Default Tech entered in this function</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: bold;">Status:</span> If a technician is assigned, 
 the Technician status will be set based on the Web Access field in the 
 Technician viewer unless overridden via registry; see Required Resources 
 below for special status processing . PM’s with no tech assigned default 
 to Waiting Service</p>
<p style="margin-left: 8px;"><font style="font-weight: bold;">Required 
 Resources:</font>  Flagged items on the Service Parts List from the 
 PM Schedule are written to the WO&#39;s Required Resources tab. The Location 
 field of Required Resource lines remains blank.  The status will 
 be set to Waiting Parts if Required Resource parts (from flagged Service 
 Parts lines) will be actually be written to the PM. A registry may be 
 used to override this status for Require Resource PM&#39;s.</p>
<p style="margin-left: 8px;"><font style="font-weight: bold;">Subcontractor 
 Technicians:  </font>If the Technician you selected references a 
 Vendor Id AND has the Web Access set to Subcontractor on the Remote Access 
 tab, a Purchase Order will also be generated.</p>
<p style="margin-left: 48px;"><span>When a PO is generated for a </span><span style="font-weight: bold;">SubAnywhere Tech</span><span>, the initial 
 PO status is set to Released if it will include GEN lines. This prevents 
 SubAnywhere users from adding charges to PO&#39;s that already have the a 
 cost associated with it from the Equipment&#39;s PM Schedule&#39;s Contract Cost. 
  The Status for a SubAnywhere PO was will be set to Unreleased if 
 no GEN lines are included so that the SubAnywhere user may add charges 
 to the PO.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: bold;">Work Order Name:</span> The system 
 sets the Work Order Name from the Work Code (if available).</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: bold;">Date and Item:</span> The system automatically 
 writes the Date Scheduled for the PM to the Date Earliest Start and sets 
 the Date Must Complete to the last day of the month specified in date 
 scheduled during PM work order generation. The Time Earliest Start is 
 set to 7:00 AM and Time Must Complete is set to 5:00 P.M. </p>
<p><span style="font-weight: bold;">Service Category:</span> This field 
 is set from the PM Inspection Work Code first and the Equipment record 
 second.</p>
<p><font style="font-weight: bold;">PM Master Contract:</font> When this 
 function is run for sites that reference a <a href="PM_Master_Schedule_Master_Contract_.htm">PM 
 Master Schedule (Master Contract)</a> , the Technician Id (on the Main 
 tab of the Client Site Equipment record) will be used to set the default 
 Technician in the PM Schedule of the Equipment record and the Work Order.</p>
<p>In addition to the PM Master Schedule, other functions may be used to 
 update the PM Schedule on the Site Equipment record. For details, click 
 <a href="Renew_Service_Contract.htm">Renew Service Contract</a> or <a href="Create_New_PM_Work_Schedule_from_Old.htm">Create New PM Work 
 Schedule from Old</a> .</p>
<p><span>If the Service Task Id is blank in the Master Contract Schedule 
 tab, the system looks to see if there is one specified in the Client Site 
 Equipment when this function is run. This Service Task will be defaulted 
 to the Client Site Equipment PM Schedule and then to the PM Work Order 
 itself. This allows different Task Lists to be assigned by the Equipment 
 scheduled. A Registry may be used to <a href="Registry_Entry_Global_Settings__Column_Compression__Dispatch_Board_Rows__History_Log_Inventory_Markup.htm#Disable_Equipment_Service_Task_Master_Contract_PM">Disable 
 Use of Equipment Service Task when Master Contract PM&#39;s are Created</a>.</span></p>
<h2>Registry Entries:</h2>
<p><a href="Registry_Entry_Create_PM_WO.htm">Registry Entry Create PM WO</a></p>
<p><span>Registry to <a href="Registry_Entry_Global_Settings__Column_Compression__Dispatch_Board_Rows__History_Log_Inventory_Markup.htm#Disable_Equipment_Service_Task_Master_Contract_PM">Disable 
 Use of Equipment Service Task when Master Contract PM&#39;s are Created</a>.</span></p>
<h2>Important Fields:</h2>
<p><font style="font-weight: bold;">Start Date: End Date:</font><br/>
These fields define the range of Scheduled Inspection Dates that you wish 
 to create PM work orders for. You may enter the dates in mm-dd-yyyy format 
 or double-click on these fields to access the calendar viewer to do so. 
 </p>
<p><span>The dates may cross a calendar year, but the End Date is restricted 
 to a maximum of 1 year from the Start Date. The message &#39;End Date must 
 not be more than 1 year from Start Date&#39; will be displayed when the user 
 clicks Go if the date range is exceeded.</span></p>
<p><font style="font-weight: bold;">Default Tech Id:<br/>
</font>The Default Tech Id will default to the Checklist screen if the 
 Tech Id on the PM Work Order would have been blank (unassigned). It will 
 not override a Technician assigned from the Equipment record’s PM Schedule 
 tab, the Equipment record’s Main tab, or the Client Site <span style="font-weight: bold; 
	 font-style: italic;">unless the Override ALL Techs box is flagged</span>.</p>
<p>If the PM is generated from a Master Contract, the Tech on the PM Equipment 
 Schedule Lines is be set up from the Master Contracts, but the Tech you 
 specify in this field will be selected when the PM Work Order is generated.</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: bold;">Override ALL Techs?</span><span><br/>
 If this box is checked and the Technician Id field is also completed, 
 the Technician Id selected will be assigned to ALL work orders generated 
 by this function.  If the Override ALL Tech? box is blank, the Technician 
 Id (if selected) will only be used where a Technician is not specified 
 in the Equipment or Site record. If the Override ALL Techs? box is checked 
 the Technician Id must be completed.  Additional changes to the Technician 
 may be made when the Create PM WOs checklist screen is displayed.</span></p>
<p><font style="font-weight: bold;">Work Requested:<br/>
</font>If completed, this field will default to the following Checklist 
 screen. It will be used to set the Work Requested header field and the 
 Work Order Equipment&#39;s Work Requested (followed by Service Tasks / Parts 
 text if applicable).</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: bold;">Date Opened:  Time Opened:</span><br/>
 These fields will be used to set the Work Order&#39;s Date Opened and Time 
 Opened fields.  They default to the current Date and Time, but may 
 be edited by the user if desired. Some reports and standard KPI&#39;s utilize 
 the WO Date Opened for date range filtering and analysis of calls &quot;opened&quot;. 
  These reports/analytics would provide a better analysis if the Date 
 opened is set to the date the work is scheduled, or the first day for 
 the month the work is scheduled for. In addition, this enhancement allows 
 Escalation events sensitive to &quot;creation&quot; date/time to be handle 
 more accurately, rather than beginning &quot;prematurely&quot;.</p>
<p><font style="font-weight: bold;">Client Id:<br/>
</font>If you only wish to generate PM Work Orders for a specific client 
 (as defined in the PM Job record), enter the appropriate Client Id(s). 
 If you leave this field blank, Work Orders for the specified Inspection 
 Date(s) for all applicable clients will be generated within your security 
 level.</p>
<p><font style="font-weight: bold;">Client Site Id:</font><br/>
If you only wish to generate PM Work Orders for a specific site enter the 
 appropriate Client Site Id(s). If you leave this field blank, Work Orders 
 for the specified Inspection Date(s) for all applicable Client Sites will 
 be generated within your security level.</p>
<p style="margin-left: 36.00pt;">Example: To generate PM&#39;s for the month 
 of June, 2000 for the Client Sites ACME001 to ACME999 the ranges would 
 be set as follows:</p>
<p style="margin-left: 36.00pt;"> Start Date: End Date  <font style="font-weight: bold;">06012000 06302000</font><br/>
 Client Site Id:   <font style="font-weight: bold;">ACME001_ACME999</font></p>
<p><font style="font-weight: bold;">Branch Id:</font><br/>
If you wish to only create work orders for specific branches, enter the 
 Branch Id (or double-click to select from a list). Several Branches may 
 be specified by separating their Id&#39;s with a comma.</p>
<p><font style="font-weight: bold;">Project Id:</font><br/>
If you wish to only create work orders for pm jobs associated with a specific 
 project or projects, enter the desired Project Id(s).</p>
<p><font style="font-weight: bold;">Work Code Id:<br/>
Service Category Id:<br/>
</font>If you wish to limit the creation of work orders to those with a 
 specific work code or the service category referenced in the work code, 
 enter its Id in this range.</p>
<p><font style="font-weight: bold;">Master Contract Id:</font><br/>
If you wish to only create work orders for equipment assigned to a specific 
 Master Contract enter the desired Id.</p>
<p><font style="font-weight: bold;">Agreement Type Id:<br/>
</font>This range enables the user run this function for only those Master 
 Contracts with the selected Agreement types.</p>
<p><font style="font-weight: bold;" color="#FF0000">Note: Work Order Priority</font> 
 <font color="#FF0000"><br/>
</font>The priority of each Work Order is set from the Work Code specified 
 in the Client Site Equipment PM Schedule entry used to generate the PM 
 WorkOrder. If more than one piece of equipment at a site is scheduled 
 for the same WorkOrder on the same day, the priority of the WorkOrder 
 will be based on the lowest numbered Work Code priority scheduled for 
 that day. When PM WorkOrders are generated, the checklist will now appear 
 in the following order:</p>
<p>       Client Site  Date Scheduled 
  Work Code Priority  Equipment Id</p>
<p>If a Work Code is not included in the PM Schedule, the priority of the 
 PM Work Order will default to 0.</p>
