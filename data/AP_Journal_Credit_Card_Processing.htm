<h1>AP Journal Credit Card Processing</h1>
<p>Normally when an invoice is vouchered that you WILL cut a check against, 
 the detail lines are DEBIT to EXPENSE ACCOUNTS and the total is CREDIT 
 to A/P CONTROL...which will ultimately get relieved when you cut the check 
 (DEBIT A/P CONTROL &amp; CR CASH @ that the point of Check Posting).<br/>
<br/>
A slightly different procedure should be used when credit cards are involved. 
 To satisfy the necessary system mechanics for Credit Card Processing, 
 you may wish to handle these types of invoices as follows:<br/>
<br/>
<font style="font-weight: bold;">1.</font> <font style="font-weight: bold;">Create 
 the Appropriate AP Credit Card Payment GL Account(s)</font></p>
<p>Create a liability account &quot;A/P Credit Card Payments&quot;...do 
 not mark it Attribute AP Control, but INSTEAD mark it with the Attribute 
 of &quot;BANK&quot;. If you have <font style="font-weight: bold;">multiple 
 cards</font>, we would recommend creating multiple &#39;bank&#39; GL 
 Accounts – one for each card. Note:  Making a GL Account &#39;attribute&#39; 
 as BANK, just allows the Bank Recon programs to used to reconcile&#39; 
 the credit card statement(s).  </p>
<p>2. Purchase Orders</p>
<p>When creating a PO that will ultimately be paid via credit card, make 
 sure that you reference the correct VENDOR (NOT the credit card company). 
 Of course, the PO must have the correct GL Account distributions (expense, 
 cost of sales, etc) and be coded to the correct W/O and/or Job.</p>
<p>3. Vouchering Vendor Invoices</p>
<p>As you voucher the invoice that is being paid by Credit Card, fill everything 
 out as would normally be the case...<br/>
(the vendor remains the &quot;purchase from vendor&quot; NOT the &quot;cc 
 provider&quot;)...  and add one additional step to this transaction...</p>
<p>- Do NOT use an AP Terms associated with a DISCOUNT % when 
 recording the entry</p>
<p>- In the manual check area of the A/P screen, mark the entry &quot;CR/DR 
 CARD&quot;. When you mark the entry as DR/CR CARD, this will basically &#39;pay&#39; 
 this entry so it does not show up on an aging report as being due.    So....if 
 someone enters 50 charges on the cr card, the PO&#39;s shows the &#39;history&#39; 
 of where the purchases were made &amp; for which W/O and/or JOB. </p>
<p>- Fill in the GL Account with the &quot;A/P Credit Card Payments&quot; 
 account that you&#39;ve created and assign a check date as the date of 
 the Credit Card transaction</p>
<p>- Filling in the EFT/Credit Trx Id is optional. For tracking purposes, 
 if left blank, system will assign number of the AP Journal transaction 
 to it when the entry is saved. You can also use the PO number or an authorization 
 code if you don&#39;t want system to use AP Journal transaction number.   </p>
<p>Here will be the result of your transaction:</p>
<p>DEBIT detail line EXPENSE ACCOUNTS<br/>
DEBIT &amp; CREDIT  total invoice amount to AP CONTROL (net $0.00 
 to AP CONTROL)<br/>
CREDIT to account A/P Credit Card Payments</p>
<p>4. Vouchering the Credit Card Provider Invoice</p>
<p>Ultimately you WILL receive an invoice from the CC provider that must 
 be paid and you will create a separate APJ transaction for that invoice. 
 Providing you vouchered the PO&#39;s as CR Card Trx, you would enter just 
 1 amount  (total statement, with no job info),  the 
 GL Distribution would be to the exact same GL Account that we 
 marked as  the &#39;BANK&#39; account for those items that were on a 
 PO.   </p>
<p>- The account referenced on the detail line for that invoice should 
 be “A/P Credit Card Payments.”</p>
<p style="margin-left: 48px;"><span style="font-weight: bold;">GL BANK 
 ACCOUNT NOTE:</span> by default, validation prohibits Bank Accounts on 
 the Gen line.  See the <a href="Registry_Entry_AP_Journal.htm#Disable_Account_Type_Validations_on_General_lines">Registry 
 AP Journal option to Disable Account Type Validation on General Lines</a> 
 if needed.</p>
<p>- This will DEBIT that LIABILITY, and CREDIT A/P CONTROL in preparation 
 for an actual check to be produced to the CC Provider.</p>
<p>- FOR THOSE ITEMS NOT LINKED to a PO, then user would add 
 general lines and code the $$$ difference  to the proper GL Expense 
 Accounts and use a WO/Job, if it applies.   </p>
<p>5. Clearing the Credit Card Transactions</p>
<p>Though not necessary, you may wish to include the step of &quot;clearing&quot; 
 the &quot;Credit Card Trx Id&quot; used against the &quot;A/P Credit Card 
 Payment bank account&quot;, using the Bank Reconciliation processes... 
 as those charges show up on your CC Statements.</p>
<p>6. Reporting</p>
<p>You can print the Bank Reconciliation and or Check Register reports to 
 see all of the PO&#39;s that were &#39;vouchered&#39; as a Credit Card entry for the 
 &#39;bank&#39; (credit card) Gl Account#.   </p>
<p>The GL Account History Report and also be run for each &#39;Credit Card&#39; 
 gl account.</p>
<p>7. Credit PO’s</p>
<p>System now allows Credit PO’s to be recorded as DB/CR card transactions. 
 This functionality might be used in the following scenario:</p>
<p>- Purchase Order created for part for a work order.<br/>
- Tech picks up part and pays with a credit card.<br/>
- PO vouchered using the CC/DB Card area and specifies the GL account.<br/>
- Part is not used and is slated for return<br/>
- Create Credit PO for part return.<br/>
- Voucher Credit PO using the CC/DB Card area and specify the GL account.</p>
<p><font style="font-weight: bold;">Voiding Manual Checks / EFT’s<br/>
</font>DO NOT use the Void AP Check function to void a manual check.  Changes 
 to AP Transactions for manual checks should be accomplished by first deleting 
 the transaction (to remove the entire invoice/check#) and then re-entering 
 it. The way that you would delete a manual AP Check or Credit 
 Card entry is as follows:</p>
<p>1. Load the APJ entry into the viewer.  You should get a warning 
 about the closed Period.<br/>
2. Change the Accounting Period to one that is Active.<br/>
3. Change the Effective Date to one that satisfies the selected Accounting 
 Period.<br/>
4. Push the Delete Record button and answer Yes to the &#39;Delete all children&#39; 
 prompt.<br/>
5. Answer No to the &#39;re-use check&#39; question.</p>
<p><font style="font-weight: bold;">Note on Audit Trails:</font> the 
 original and reversing AP Journal trx are maintained but you 
 will need to filter to ALL to see them.</p>
<p><font style="font-weight: bold;">Note on Bank Reconciliation:</font> 
 AP Check and Credit Card transactions deleted in this manner do NOT appear 
 on the Bank Reconciliation when the Auto Fill Trans button is clicked.</p>
