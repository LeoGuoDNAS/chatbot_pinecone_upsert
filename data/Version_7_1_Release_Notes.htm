<H1>Version 7.1 Release Notes – 7.1.461.196</H1>
 <P><A href="version_7_1_release_notes.htm#Version_71_Recent_Updates">Recent 7.1 Enhancements and Patches</A> </P>
 <P style="margin-left:36.00pt;"><FONT style="font-weight:bold; " >Important Note - </FONT><FONT style="font-weight:bold; " >Start Update Function List</FONT></P>
 <P style="margin-left:36.00pt;">This function should be run to update context specific Help links and new SAM Pro functions. </P>
 <P style="margin-left:36.00pt;"><FONT style="font-weight:bold; " >Sybase Users May Need to Add Index for Performance Issues: </FONT>discuss with your support rep before updating. </P>
 <H1>1. System</H1>
 <H2>1.1 Keystrokes</H2>
 <P>Corrects inappropriate “PR not enabled” message on clicking folders, viewers and functions lists. </P>
 <P>In single-line text / Id boxes, the End key takes caret past the last used character, not simply last column. </P>
 <P>Ctrl-End now moves the caret past the last used position in a multi-line field.&nbsp;</P>
 <P><FONT style="font-weight:bold; " >Type Ahead:</FONT> This version corrects a problem that was caused by list viewers not being sorted correctly when they were first displayed; items with special character such as / and # were not ordered properly. The system now sorts these lists correctly in the first place. Note: SAM Pro considers the hyphen (-) to come before the blank space in the sort order. </P>
 <H2>1.2 Filter Button on Top Button Bar</H2>
 <P>The Filter button has been added to the top button bar of record viewer so that the user can switch between the record and filter views without having to access the List viewer first. </P>
 <H2>1.3  Filter View</H2>
 <P>In previous releases, if a field in a record was disabled, the corresponding range field in the filter view was also disabled.  Now, the filter range is not disabled so that the user may filter on the field. . </P>
 <H3>1.3.1 Closed Filter for Journal viewers</H3>
 <P><FONT style="font-weight:bold; " >Change Field: Next Id</FONT></P>
 <P>When you select the Closed filter on a Journal listing, the Next Id range is now automatically set to = so that only the final JE appears for Closed entries.</P>
 <P>Note that Deleted entries will not appear on a Closed listing because their Next Id is set to ‘Deleted’.  To view only Deleted entries, enter Deleted in the Next Id range, clear the other ranges, and click the Filter Records button to display the list. </P>
 <H1>1.4 Multinational Currency Enhancements</H1>
 <H2>1.4.1 Overview</H2>
 <P>The scope of SAM Pro’s multinational currency has been expanded to include job and work order invoicing and inventory.  In order for this to work properly, your Currency Master record and registry entry (see user notes 2.5) must be correctly configured.  See the user notes for the Currency Master for details on setting up the appropriate GL Accounts.</P>
 <P><FONT style="font-weight:bold; " >End of Month Considerations</FONT></P>
 <P>It is assumed that contra accounts will be set up for A/P, A/R and Bank Foreign Exchange transactions. This will enable the accounting department to manually record end-of-month transactions to balance the foreign exchange account. </P>
 <H2>1.4.2 Currency Master Record</H2>
 <H2>Purpose:</H2>
 <P>This table enables the system to support multi-national currency for both payable and receivable transactions. </P>
 <P>The system will default the Currency Id from the Vendor record (for AP Transactions and Purchases) and the Client record (for AR transactions and Invoices). If the Currency Id is completed in the Purchase Order, AP, AR Sales or AR Cash Receipts journals, it indicates to the system that the amounts being entered are in the original, foreign currency, rather than in your firm’s local currency in which your GL is maintained </P>
 <H2>Usage:</H2>
 <P>This functionality enables your firm to operate in a corporate (base) currency and receive (AR) and/or remit (AP, Purchasing) funds in a currency of original entry.  A currency master record should be made for each foreign currency your firm does business in. </P>
 <P>It is assumed that your firm will maintain a separate bank account for each foreign currency. This account is assumed to be maintained in that currency. </P>
 <P style="text-indent:36.00pt;">Currency conversions, when implemented, will use the following equations:</P>
 <P style="text-indent:30.25pt;">Foreign * Currency Factor = Local</P>
 <P style="text-indent:30.25pt;">Local / Currency Factor = Foreign</P>
 <P>The system will determine the Currency Factor based on the Currency Id and the Effective Date of the transaction (which will tell it which line of the of the Currency Master record to read). </P>
 <H3>Posting Rules:</H3>
 <P>When currency conversion is turned on for GL and JCH entries via registry, the following rules apply:</P>
 <P>&nbsp;AR and AP entries are NOT converted to your local currency. This means that </P>
 <P style="margin-left:72.00pt;">Job invoices will appear in the foreign currency</P>
 <P style="margin-left:72.00pt;">Cash Receipts will be entered (to the appropriate banks account) in the foreign currency</P>
 <P style="margin-left:72.00pt;">Purchase Orders will be entered in the foreign currency</P>
 <P style="margin-left:72.00pt;">AP Entries will be recorded in the foreign currency</P>
 <P style="margin-left:72.00pt;">AP Checks will be issued in the foreign currency (on the appropriate bank account)</P>
 <P style="margin-left:36.00pt;">Vendor History will NOT be converted to your local currency. </P>
 <P style="margin-left:36.00pt;">&nbsp;The amounts will appear as they were entered in the foreign currency.</P>
 <P style="margin-left:36.00pt;">&nbsp;The Currency Id and Factor will be recorded in these entries for historical/reporting purposes. </P>
 <P style="margin-left:36.00pt;">AP and AR Discounts entered for foreign Vendors / Clients (in foreign currency) will be converted to local currency when they are posted to GL.</P>
 <P style="margin-left:36.00pt;">Job History </P>
 <P style="margin-left:36.00pt;text-indent:36.00pt;">All costs will be converted to your local currency; the original foreign currency value is not retained. </P>
 <P style="margin-left:36.00pt;">Inventory History</P>
 <P style="margin-left:72.00pt;">Both foreign and local currency are maintained for unit costs</P>
 <P style="margin-left:36.00pt;text-indent:36.00pt;">All other cost fields are converted to your local currency.</P>
 <P style="margin-left:36.00pt;">GL History will SOMETIMES be converted:</P>
 <P style="margin-left:72.00pt;">Transactions written to the GL AP Control, GL AR Control, and Bank Accounts associated with a Currency Master Record will NOT be converted to local currency.</P>
 <P style="margin-left:72.00pt;">Transactions that record expenses will always be converted to your firm’s local currency.</P>
 <P style="margin-left:72.00pt;">Differences between the foreign and local currency will be written to the Foreign Exchange Gain/Loss Account</P>
 <H2>Registry Entries:</H2>
 <P>The <A href="registry_entry_currency_adjustment.htm">Registry Entry for Currency Adjustments</A>  must be made to specify that postings to GL and JCH are converted from foreign to local currency.</P>
 <H2>Important Fields:  Upper Section</H2>

 <H2>Important Fields: Lower Section</H2>
 <P class="Tab" style="background-color:#e5e5e5; border-top:1.50pt solid black;border-bottom:1.50pt solid black;border-left:1.50pt solid black;border-right:1.50pt solid black;">Factors Tab</P>
 <P class="Reference_Line" style="margin-bottom:0.00pt;">This tab specifies the Currency Conversion Factors FROM the foreign currency TO your local currency for various date ranges according to the following equation:</P>
 <P style="text-indent:30.25pt;">Foreign * Currency Factor = Local</P>
 <P class="Reference_Line" style="margin-bottom:0.00pt;">Always add a new line when you add a new date range. </P>
 <P><FONT style="font-weight:bold; " >Start Date:&nbsp;End Date:<BR></FONT>Enter the Start and End days that this conversion factor is applicable to in <FONT style="font-style:italic; " >mmddyyyy</FONT> format (or double-click to access the calendar).  <FONT style="font-weight:bold; " > Be sure that your date ranges do not overlap.</FONT></P>
 <P><FONT style="font-weight:bold; " >Factor:<BR></FONT>The conversion factor required to convert this currency of original entry to the corporate (base) currency used by your firm for the General Ledger. </P>
 <P style="margin-left:36.00pt;"><FONT style="font-weight:bold; text-decoration:underline;" >Example: <BR></FONT>Suppose your local, corporate currency is Canadian Dollars, and you wish to make an entry for your US Dollars Currency Master.

 <P style="margin-left:36.00pt;">Aug 04, 2008&nbsp;Aug 10, 2008&nbsp;1.134</P>
 <P style="margin-left:36.00pt;"><FONT style="font-weight:bold; " >Tip: Updating Your Currency Master Tables<BR></FONT>It is important to update this table on a timely basis. We suggest that the End Date of the newest range always extends past the date on which you expect to update the table. In that way, if you miss updating the table a reasonable conversion factor will be in place.  When you update the table, make sure that your date ranges do not overlap. </P>
 <P class="Tab" style="background-color:#e5e5e5; border-top:1.50pt solid black;border-bottom:1.50pt solid black;border-left:1.50pt solid black;border-right:1.50pt solid black;">Clients Tab</P>

 <H2>1.4.3  Reports Updated to Support Currency Conversion</H2>
 <P>The following reports have been revised to support foreign currency. A current version must be imported into your database if you are using or intend to use currency conversion. </P>
 <P><FONT style="font-weight:bold; " >Report </FONT><FONT style="font-weight:bold; " >GL History</FONT><FONT style="font-weight:bold; " > by Account (DGLHSTRY.rpt)</FONT><FONT style="font-weight:bold; " ><BR></FONT>This report has been revised as of 12/14/2007 to display the Currency Abbreviation of accounts maintained in a foreign currency for the Beginning and Ending Balance. The system looks to the Currency Master record to determine if an account is maintained in a foreign currency. The Currency Master’s AP Control, AR Control, Bank Account, AP Retainage and AR Retainage accounts are assumed to be maintained in a foreign currency.</P>
 <P>If an entry has been made in currency that does not match the currency the account is maintained, the report will flag this transaction with the message &quot;*****Currency&quot; followed by the transaction’s currency abbreviation. </P>
 <P><FONT style="font-weight:bold; " >Service Billing Worksheet<BR></FONT>This report has been updated to display the currency the revenue is being billed in.  The currency factor (as of the invoicing date) will also be listed. </P>
 <P><FONT style="font-weight:bold; " >Service Invoice Post<BR></FONT>This report has been updated to display currency adjustment details when appropriate. The Currency Id and Factor will be printed, followed by the GL transactions generated to the Foreign Currency Adjustment Account, the AR and Retainage Accounts (in the foreign currency), and the Discount and Sales Accounts (converted to your local currency).  </P>
 <H2>1.4.4  AR and Invoicing – Currency Conversion Notes</H2>
 <P>If foreign currency and job override processing are both in effect, the Service Compute and Reverse Job Invoice GL posts to the Currency Adjustment account now include the correct Security Id. This release also corrects Branch Override processing on these functions. </P>
 <H3>1.4.4.1 Client Viewer</H3>
 <P><FONT style="font-weight:bold; " >Currency Id:<BR></FONT>If you will be billing your foreign clients in their currency, and receiving their payments in their currency, this field must be completed.</P>
 <P>If you are updating an existing Client record, this field must only be changed if there is no current activity on the account (e.g, unpaid bills). In this way, new invoices will be sent and received in the Client’s currency. If you cannot clear an account, you may need to create a new client and job records so that all new revenues will be in the correct (foreign) denomination. </P>
 <H3>1.4.4.2  Rate Schedule</H3>
 <P>Separate Rate Schedules must be created for your foreign currency customers and referenced in the applicable Job records. These Rate Schedules must reference Labor, Material and Other Rate Tables that specify the revenues in terms of the foreign currency – as you wish them to appear on invoices. </P>
 <P style="margin-left:36.00pt;"><FONT style="font-weight:bold; " >Vendor Record – Service Provider Rates: Rate Schedule Id:<BR></FONT>If foreign currency processing is implemented on your system, the Rate Schedule should be maintained in the currency of the subcontractor.</P>
 <H3>1.4.4.3 Labor Rate Table</H3>
 <P>Separate Labor Rate tables must be created for your foreign currency customers. These tables must specify the Labor revenue in terms of the foreign currency – as you wish it to appear on the invoices. </P>
 <P style="margin-left:36.00pt;"><FONT style="font-weight:bold; " >Note: </FONT>Typically, you would not need to create a whole new set of individual labor rates. Instead, simply use the Labor Rate Table to provide appropriate revenue rates for the foreign currency. </P>
 <P><FONT style="font-weight:bold; " >Rate: </FONT><FONT style="font-weight:bold; " >Bill Type Id:</FONT></P>
 <P>If your Bill Type Id is set to Unit Price, your Rate must be specified in terms of the foreign currency, as it will appear on the invoice.</P>
 <P>If you are marking up labor based on costs (for Bill Types of Margin, Markup or Multiplier), remember that the costs will be maintained in your local currency. The Rate must include the adjustment from the local cost to the foreign revenue. </P>
 <H3>1.4.4.4 Other Rate Table</H3>
 <P>Separate Other Rate tables must be created for your foreign currency customers. These tables must specify the Other revenue in terms of the foreign currency – as you wish it to appear on the invoices. </P>
 <P style="margin-left:36.00pt;"><FONT style="font-weight:bold; " >Note: </FONT>Typically, you would not need to create a whole new set of individual other rates. Instead, simply use the Other Rate Table to provide appropriate revenue rates for the foreign currency. </P>
 <P><FONT style="font-weight:bold; " >Level:<BR></FONT>If used, levels are specified in terms of local costs. </P>

 <P>Separate Material Rate tables must be created for your foreign currency customers. If your inventory items are not ‘unit price’, these tables must specify the material markup such that your material costs (which are maintained in your local currency) are marked up to an appropriate foreign revenue. Note that this material markup will also be applied to miscellaneous materials.</P>
 <P><FONT style="font-weight:bold; " >Level:<BR></FONT>If used, levels are specified in terms of local costs. </P>
 <P><FONT style="font-weight:bold; " >Rate: <BR></FONT>Costs will be maintained in your local currency. <FONT style="font-weight:bold; font-style:italic; " >The Rate must include the adjustment from the local cost to the foreign revenue. </FONT></P>

Your firm may choose to reserve one or more of these levels to use with foreign currency (e.g., levels 1-3 for local currency, 4-6 for foreign currency A, 7-9 for foreign currency B). If so, the price should be entered in terms of the foreign currency, as it should appear on the foreign customer’s invoice. </P>
 <P><FONT style="font-weight:bold; " >If you sometimes use price codes:</FONT> since price codes only support 5 levels, your firm should limit the pricing structure to 5 levels. In this case, your firm may choose to reserve one or more of these levels to use of foreign currency (e.g., levels 1-3 your local currency, 4 for foreign currency A, 5 for foreign currency B). If so, the price should be entered in terms of the foreign currency, as it should appear on the foreign customer’s invoice. </P>
 <P style="margin-left:36.00pt;"><FONT style="font-weight:bold; " >Important Note:</FONT> Be sure to correctly specify the <FONT style="font-weight:bold; font-style:italic; " >Material Price Level in the Job and the Client Site records</FONT>.

The system no longer attempts to archive the emailed copy in addition to the other copies that are being saved / archived as defined in the registry settings for the report. </P>
 <H2>1.10 Notes Records</H2>
 <P><FONT style="font-weight:bold; " > </FONT><FONT style="font-weight:bold; " >New Field - Priority</FONT><FONT style="font-weight:bold; " >:</FONT> <BR>The new Priority field is a single digit allowing values of 0-9.&nbsp; There is a new pick list option on the Notes viewer that sorts by Priority. By default, new Notes are assigned a priority of 0. Existing Notes (converted from earlier versions of the software) are also assigned a priority of 0. </P>
 <H2>1.11 Revenue Calculations of Other items with a Billing Type of n/a</H2>
 <P>This change effects the PO, Labor, and AP Journals.  It corrects a problem where the Billing Type was set to n/a and a Revenue Amount entered manually.  If another field (Job Id, CostCode Id, BillItem Id, OtherRate Id, CostCategory Id or TaxTypeId) was then changed, the Unit Price and Revenue Amount were zeroed out.  With this release, the Revenue Amount is retained if the Billing Type is n/a. In addition, if the user changes the Billing Rate Type Id to 'n/a' from anything else, the costs and revenues will be retained. </P>
 <H2>1.12  Labor Start and End Times</H2>
 <P>Start and End time columns have been added to the Labor Journal, Work Order Labor Tab, and the Job Journal in the version 7.1 database.  If you would like to be able to access these fields for entering and recording employee data, please contact your support representative for details. A customization file will be needed to display these fields on your system. </P>
 <P>The following validations will be performed on these new fields: </P>
 <P>1. Start Time can't exceed End Time unless End Time is empty.<BR>2. End Time can't precede Start Time.</P>
 <P>Changes to either the Start or End times trigger a computation of the Hours.&nbsp; </P>
 <P><FONT style="font-weight:bold; " >Registry Option</FONT><FONT style="font-weight:bold; " >s</FONT><FONT style="font-weight:bold; " > to Reset the End Time if the Hours are Adjusted</FONT></P>
 <P>By default, if the user adjusts the Actual Hours, the system will NOT adjust the End Time so that the Start Time, End Time and Actual Hours fields are always in synch with one another.  To have the system automatically reset the End Time, the registry options specified in user notes 2.6, 2.10 and 2.11 must be implemented. </P>
 <H2>1.13 Common Phrases </H2>
 <P><FONT style="font-weight:bold; " >New Field: Field Restrictions<BR></FONT>This new field can be used to restrict the list of fields for which a specific Common Phrase is applicable.&nbsp;This field may also be used to control the use of Common Phrases on the tech device.

 <H2>1.14 Start Registry Export </H2>
 <P>This function allows the user to export a registry entry, or set of registry entries, to the file system as an XML file. In the case of multiple registry entries, all the entries are encapsulated in a single XML file. </P>
 <H2>Usage:</H2>
 <P>This function would typically be run to provide Data-Basics support with your registry settings for analysis or upgrading purposes. It is recommended that ONLY the system administrator at a client installation be given access to this function. </P>
 <H2>Important Fields:</H2>
 <P><FONT style="font-weight:bold; " >Id:</FONT></P>
 <P>The user may specify one or more registry id’s to export, or double-click to select from a list.</P>
 <P style="margin-left:36.00pt;">Example: to export all folder-viewer registry entries: sys-folder%</P>
 <P style="margin-left:36.00pt;">Example: to export all registry entries: %</P>
 <P>When you click the Go button, the system will ask you to select a directory to export the XML file to. Be sure to note the location and filename so that you can easily locate the file. </P>
 <H2>1.15 Start Registry Import</H2>
 <P>This function allows the user to import a registry entry, or set of registry entries, from an XML file. This function is particularly useful for making changes to the Folders viewer and dispatch board defaults with files provided by your support representative.</P>
 <H2>Usage:</H2>
 <P>This function would typically be run to import registry entries provided by Data-Basics support. It is recommended that ONLY the system administrator at a client installation be given access to this function. </P>
 <P><FONT style="font-weight:bold; " >If multiple or cr</FONT><FONT style="font-weight:bold; " >itical entries will be imported</FONT><FONT style="font-weight:bold; " >, it is strongly recommended the Export Registry function be run to export ALL registry entries to a safe location before running the import. </FONT></P>

 <P><FONT style="font-weight:bold; " >Prepend Key With: </FONT><FONT style="font-weight:bold; " ><BR></FONT>The contents of this field will be pre-pended to the key of all imported entries. This allows the imported entries to be evaluated or edited before removing the prepended values so the entry is ‘live’. </P>
 <P style="margin-left:36.00pt;"><FONT style="text-decoration:underline;" >Example:</FONT> <BR>Enter TEST to prepend the imported entries with TEST. In this case, sys-newcall would be imported as TESTsys-newcall. </P>
 <P><FONT style="font-weight:bold; " >Append Key With:</FONT><FONT style="font-weight:bold; " ><BR></FONT>The contents of this field will be appended to the key of all imported entries.

 <H2>1.16 Branch Viewer</H2>
 <P><FONT style="font-weight:bold; " >New Field – Branch Prefix:<BR></FONT>A new field named Branch Prefix has been added to the Branch table.&nbsp; This is a 2-character field that can be used to prefix various SAMPRO auto-sequenced Id fields.&nbsp; For example, if &quot;CL&quot; is the prefix for the Cleveland branch, then each work order created for Cleveland could begin with CL followed by the next sequential work order number IF the registry entry (below) is implemented.</P>
 <P>NOTE: this enhancement DOES NOT implement separate record sequencers by branch.&nbsp; Consider the case of a company with branches in Cleveland, Columbus and Cincinnati.&nbsp; Standard SAMPRO code would assign Work Order Ids sequentially based on the value contained in the database table named nextwo.&nbsp; Code from this case would take the &quot;standard&quot; sequential value and prefix it with the appropriate branch prefix.&nbsp; The actual work order id assignments might look like this ...<BR>&nbsp; CL100001&nbsp; (Cleveland)<BR>&nbsp; CI100002&nbsp; (Cincinnati)<BR>&nbsp; CL100003&nbsp; (Cleveland)<BR>&nbsp; CO100004&nbsp; (Columbus)</P>
 <P>The code that determines which branch prefix to use varies depending on the record.&nbsp;In order to implement the branch prefixing discussed above, the registry setting described in user note 2.12.3 must be in place. </P>
 <H2>1.17 Copy and Paste</H2>
 <P>The code to copy the contents of SAM Pro fields to the clipboard did not do the required clearing of the Window’s clipboard first. This has been fixed. In addition, the system now trims trailing blanks from the contents of the field before copying the contents to the clipboard. </P>
 <H2>1.18 Performance Enhancements</H2>
 <H3>1.18.1 Escalation Manager</H3>
 <P>These enhancements should positively impact a variety of functions, including Create PM Workorders, Create PM Billing, the Dispatch Board, and New Call.  </P>
 <H2>1.19 Start Archive Record Change Log</H2>
 <H2>Purpose:</H2>
 <P>Performance when opening viewers can be negatively impacted by the number of records in the record change log table. This table is automatically maintained by the system and lists the record that was changed, the user that changed it, and the date and time of the change.  This new function's purpose is to provide a means of managing the table’s size without losing any data as this function moves the selected rows from the record change log table to the record charge log archive table. The advantage of this function is that the system does not have to access or write to the archive tab each time a record is accessed or saved. </P>
 <H2>Usage:</H2>
 <P>This function executes without screen input so that it can be scheduled to run after hours using the Scheduled Event Manager.  By default, the most recent 10 days of change log data will be retained in the change log table, while change log data older than 10 days will be moved to the change log archive. The number of days of data to retain can be controlled by the following registry entry. </P>
 <H2>Registry:</H2>
 <H2>Important Fields:</H2>
 <P><FONT style="font-weight:bold; " >Id:  </FONT>sys-start-sarchvercrdchngelg<BR><BR><FONT style="font-weight:bold; " >Contents / Additional Contents:</FONT></P>
 <P><FONT style="font-weight:bold; " >DaysToSave=integer <BR></FONT>Enter how many days of change records you want to retain in the change log table. (Default 10).  </P>
 <P><FONT style="text-decoration:underline;" >Example:</FONT></P>
 <P>&nbsp;Assume that you specify the following option and then run the archive:</P>
 <P>&nbsp;DaysToSave=30</P>
 <P style="margin-left:36.00pt;">When the archive is run, all change log records older than 30 days will be move to the record change log archive table. </P>
 <H2>1.20 Document Scanning Wizard</H2>
 <P>This enhancement adds the ability to set the Document Description field from the Scan wizard. This involves an additional step when the scanning is finished to allow the user to enter the field.</P>
 <H2>1.21 Spell Checking</H2>
 <P>Spell Checking is now disabled when processes are running in Data Emulation mode. This change was made to avoid problems with TechAnywhere updates to work orders. </P>
 <H2>1.22 User-Defined Functions</H2>
 <P>The PRINT LIST and CSV DUMP functions now work in this viewer. </P>
 <H2>1.23 ReportAnywhere</H2>
 <P><FONT style="font-weight:bold; " >Print Hard Copy Enhancement</FONT></P>
 <P>The ability to print a hard copy of reports from ReportAnywhere has been implemented. This functionality also supports the printing of the bitmap assorted with the report via registry. </P>
 <P>The following fields have been added to the Report Schedule screen. </P>
 <P><FONT style="font-weight:bold; " >Print Options&nbsp;</FONT></P>
 <P style="margin-left:36.00pt;"><FONT style="font-weight:bold; " >Print Hard Copy?</FONT>If you check this box, a hard copy of this report will be printed to the printer that you select when you click Go.

 <H2>1.24 Import Reports</H2>
 <P>This version includes a performance enhancement to speed up this function. </P>
 <H2>1.25 Viewers </H2>
 <P>Better handling of viewer lists with massive amounts of data (GL History, for example) that resulted in ‘Low on Memory’ and ‘NonContinuable Protection Violation’ errors in previous versions. </P>
 <P>Corrects errors in 'backColor:' </P>
 <P>Handles sporadic problems when a new viewer was started from a button appearing on a form. </P>
 <H3>1.25.1 Child Tabs</H3>
 <P>In previous versions, the line buttons toggled between gray and enabled by clicking the Magnify and Line View buttons. If you didn’t toggle back to Line View, the buttons remain grayed out. In this version, if the user switches directly to a different tab the line buttons will be re-enabled. The line buttons are re-enabled when the user saves a record,  selects a different record from the Id field, or uses Next or Previous Record buttons. </P>
 <P style="margin-top:0;margin-bottom:0">&nbsp;</P>
 <H2>1.26 UPDATED REPORTS: Mailing Labels</H2>
 <P>The following reports have been revised to allow the user to select the format (5161 or 8163) and enter a top margin value for alignment:</P>
 <P style="margin-left:36.00pt;">Report Mailing Labels - Client  (ARCLABEL.rpt)</P>

 <P style="margin-left:36.00pt;">Report Mailing Label Employee (PRELABEL.rpt)</P>
 <P style="margin-left:36.00pt;">Report Mailing Label Vendor (APVLABEL.rpt)</P>
 <P>These reports are now available for download and installed into your customer’s databases.  The Employee version is dated 5/27/2009, and the others are 5/15/2009.</P>
 <P><FONT style="font-weight:bold; " >Important - Registry Setting Required:</FONT> A registry entry for each of the mailing label functions must be created which contains the following contents line: LinesPerPage=65</P>

 <P style="margin-left:36.00pt;">Id: sys-report-PRELABEL  Contents: LinesPerPage=65</P>
 <H2>1.27 User Report</H2>
 <P>When auto building a user report query, the quick-pick list now excludes non-database table entries such as 'rvnetype'.</P>
 <P>When generating an SQL statement for a report, sporadic improper ORDER BY clauses have been corrected. </P>
 <H2>1.28 Exiting / Switching Security</H2>
 <P>This release includes<FONT style="font-weight:bold; " > </FONT>changes to prevent sporadic problems with service invoices not being archived. Assorted fixes, including the requirement that all unsaved changes be resolved before the use logs out or switches security. &quot;Exit not allowed while open viewers have unsaved changes&quot; will be displayed if changes to any viewers must be confirmed or abandoned. This functionality does not apply to Report ranges that are open at the time of the exit. </P>
 <P>Additional processing to ensure that that neither a Security or Branch override setting gets 'stuck' in memory when switching Securithy.</P>
 <H2>1.29 User Viewer </H2>
 <P>This release corrects a problem editing a User Id if the number of active users equaled those allowed by your license. Although this problem has been corrected, in general a User Id should NOT be changed if, for example, one sampro user  was being replaced by another.&nbsp; The preferred method of handling the user record if one user will be replacing another is to first disable one user record (for the old user) and then create a new record for the new user.</P>
 <P>This release also changes the way in which ‘Active’ users of specific type are counted. Previously, when counting active users for licensing purposes, the system only looked at users whose ‘Disabled’ field was clear (set to No). In this release, active users are those whose Disabled field is clear AND whose Password Expiration Date is either blank (1900-01-01) or set to a future date. This brings the licensing calcuations in line with the users that are displayed as active in the list. </P>
 <H2>1.30 Emailing Reports</H2>
 <P>When sending a report by email from Sampro, the single quote (apostrophe) in the body of the email or subject line was being doubled. This has been corrected. </P>
 <H1>2. Registry</H1>
 <H2>2.0 Registry Viewer</H2>
 <P><FONT style="font-weight:bold; " >New Button: Export Registry<BR></FONT>A specific registry entry can be exported by pressing the ’Export Entry’ button on the Registry Viewer. This function would typically be run to provide Data-Basics support with your registry setting for analysis or upgrading purposes.</P>
 <P>The system will ask you to select a directory to export the XML file to. Be sure to note the location and filename so that you can easily locate the file. </P>
 <H2>2.1 Registry Entry for Inventory Receipts Journal – Lot Controlled Items</H2>
 <P>During inventory receiving processing, the received lot number is compared to other lot numbers received for the same inventory item from the same vendor. If a match is found, the internal lot number is automatically set to that used for the previously received vendor lot. It now appears that some vendors are re-using their lot numbers after a period of time. This can lead to the assignment if incorrect internal lot numbers to newly received lots.<BR><BR>To resolve this problem, this registry entry specifies the number of aging days. If the code finds a previously received lot but that lot was received more than the indicated days ago, do not assign the corresponding internal lot number.<BR><BR><FONT style="font-weight:bold; " >Id: &nbsp;sys-viewer-vinvntryrcpt<BR>Contents: AgingDays=</FONT><FONT style="font-weight:bold; font-style:italic; " >numberofdays</FONT></P>
 <P>Where number of days is replaced by the desired number of aging days (e.g, AgingDays=730 for a two-year lot number aging cycle). </P>
 <H2>2.2 New Registry Options for Purchase Order (sys-viewer-vprchseordrlst)</H2>
 <H3>PO Status defaults from User Purchasing Agent Property</H3>
 <P>In previous versions, the system defaulted the PO status to Released and then waits until the user tries to Add the new record before it tested to make sure the user is a Purchasing Agent.&nbsp; Only Purchasing Agents are permitted to release POs.&nbsp; Other users got a message saying they can't create a released PO and then must manually reset the status to Unreleased. The defaulting logic has been changed.&nbsp; The new rules are as follows...</P>
 <P>1. If the user is not a Purchasing Agent, the default status is Unreleased.</P>
 <P>2. If the user is a Purchasing Agent, a new registry entry has been implemented that allows for specification of a default.&nbsp; The intention here is to allow the status to default to Unreleased even when the user is a Purchasing Agent.</P>
 <P><FONT style="font-weight:bold; " >Contents: DefaultPOStatus=Unreleased </FONT></P>
 <P>3.&nbsp; If the user is a Purchasing Agent and no registry setting is available, the default status is Released.&nbsp; This is the old behavior.</P> Warn user if WO has been invoiced
 <P>When the purchase order is loaded into its viewer, WARN the user that it references a Work Order that has invoiced. </P>
 <P><FONT style="font-weight:bold; " >Contents:&nbsp;WOInvoicedWarning=</FONT><FONT style="font-weight:bold; font-style:italic; " >option</FONT></P>

 <H2>2.3 New Registry Option for sys-email</H2>
 <H3>Email CC registry setting for sys-email</H3>
 <P><FONT style="font-weight:bold; " >AutoPopulateCCAddress=true</FONT><FONT style="font-weight:bold; " ><BR></FONT>If this registry option is implemented, the system will use the currently logged in user's email address<BR>(from the contact reference in the user record) to Auto-populate the CC email address when launching the SAMPro Email formatting form. This would apply anywhere that the USER initiates the open the MANUAL email form...i.e. dispatch board, previewed report, etc.</P>
 <P>Note: Some Manual Email Forms (like on previewed reports) do not have a CC line. In these cases, the CC address will be added to the Send to address when the email is sent.</P>
 <H3>Outlook Support</H3>
 <P>This image, in conjunction with the XMLToPDF.jar included with it, work together to re-implement Outlook support for SAM Pro email.  </P>
 <P>To implement or re-implement this option:</P>
 <P><FONT style="font-weight:bold; " >Contents: UseOutlook=true</FONT></P>
 <P>If this entry is present, processing of the outgoing e-mail is passed on to MS Outlook with the to-address, subject, message and attachments&nbsp;defaulted when applicable.</P>

 <P style="margin-left:36.00pt;">The directory specified by the dbreportfiles registry entry is expected to contain subfolders xmlToPdf_Sent, xmlToPdf_Failed and xmlToPdf_Retry.&nbsp; If they don't exist in this directory, they must currently be created manually. </P>
 <H2>2.4 Shop Orders</H2>
 <H2>New option to Require at Least One ‘overhead’ item</H2>
 <P>In order to include overhead costs in the production of inventory items, 'overhead cost' inventory items may be added to shop orders. This registry entry prevents the closing of a shop order unless at least one such item is included on the shop order. </P>
 <P>The required Registry entry in 'sys-viewer-vshpordr' is:</P>
 <P style="text-indent:30.25pt;"><FONT style="font-weight:bold; " >requiredInventoryGroups=</FONT><FONT style="font-weight:bold; font-style:italic; " >groupList<BR></FONT><BR>where <FONT style="font-style:italic; " >groupList </FONT>is the Id of an Inventory Group or a list of Inventory Group Ids separated by commas.</P>
 <P style="text-indent:30.25pt;"><FONT style="text-decoration:underline;" >Example:<BR></FONT>&nbsp; &nbsp;requiredInventoryGroups = chovrhd, inmanovrhd, azovrhd</P>
 <P style="margin-left:36.00pt;">Note that only one of the required groups (not all of the groups) need be present in order to close the Shop Order. If Sampro does not find the requiredInventoryGroups requirement in the Registry or if the groupList is blank, the Shop Order automatically passes this test. Otherwise, the user will be warned to add an overhead item. </P>
 <H3>Suppress Posting to the Shop Orders Parent Record</H3>
 <P style="margin-top:0.00pt;">The following <FONT style="color:blue; text-decoration:underline;" >http://fogbugz.sampro.net:3000/fogbugz/default.asp?pg=pgEditBug&amp;command=view&amp;ixBug=1471</FONT>registry setting disables posting the shop order's parent record during the closing process.</P>
 <P style="margin-top:0.00pt;">Id: sys-viewer-vshpordr or sys-viewer-vshpordr2<BR>Contents: PostParentForClosedOrders=true</P>
 <P style="margin-top:0.00pt;">This would only be implemented if the customer is using the Shop Order viewer as the inventory transfer mechanism much like the new Material Requisitioning.&nbsp; As with the new requisitioning, the Inventory Item in the Shop Order parent record is not a 'real' assembly.&nbsp; That means they didn't want the act of closing the shop order to add to the on-hand quantity of the parent item. </P>

 <H2>2.9 Registry Entries for Enhanced AIA-Style Billing (sys-report-raia)</H2>
 <H2>Purpose:</H2>
 <P>SAM Pro now supports the printing of standard construction (AIA-style) invoices using a bitmap (form) background on plain paper. By setting up the appropriate user-defined functions and registry entries, you will be able to generate invoices to be distributed to the Owner, Purchaser and Construction Manager. </P>
 <H2>Initial Setup:</H2>
 <P><FONT style="font-weight:bold; " >1. SAM Pro Version</FONT></P>
 <P>You must be running a current version of SAM Pro version 7.0 or higher. </P>
 <P><FONT style="font-weight:bold; " >2. Import the Report</FONT></P>
 <P>If you have not already done so, import the updated raia.rpt (dated 6/052008 or later) into your database. </P>
 <P><FONT style="font-weight:bold; " >3. Create the User-Defined Functions </FONT></P>
 <P>You must create one user-defined function for each report version (Owner, Architect and Construction Manager) that you wish to print. These functions must all point at report raia.rpt. The reason that you need three of them is to that the appropriate bitmap back will be linked to each.</P>
 <P style="margin-left:36.00pt;"><FONT style="font-weight:bold; text-decoration:underline;" >Examples:</FONT></P>

 <H2>2.12&nbsp;Global Settings Options (sys-ffv-global-settings)</H2>
 <H3>2.12.1 Registry Entry to Override Security Processing</H3>
 <P>If this option is implemented, the security override processing will be implemented for the following functions so that the security of the new record is determined by the security of the Job, not the User. </P>
 <P>1. New Call<BR>2. Purchase Orders created in the PO viewer, from Generate Purchase Order, as a part of PM and New Call processing, Quotemaster and Materials Requisitioning, from TechAnywhere and SubAnywhere.<BR>3. Work Orders created in the Work Order Viewer and from Quotemaster, TechAnywhere and SubAnywhere.<BR>4. Quote viewer (and Work Orders and PO’s generated from the Quote)<BR>5. Create PM WOs<BR>6. Create PM Billing <BR>7. Record Billing Adjustments</P>
 <P style="margin-left:36.00pt;"><FONT style="font-weight:bold; " >Note that any GL Accruals generated during PM Billing will be assigned the Security Id of the individual running the function, NOT the Security Id of the Job. </FONT></P>
 <P>The following entry implements the override globally for the functions noted above.</P>
 <P><FONT style="font-weight:bold; " >SecurityOverrideFrom=job</FONT></P>
 <P>If a global override isn't desired, the individual functions can be controlled by making the ‘SecurityOverrideFrom' entry in the registry entries specific to given functions.</P>
 <P>Note that support only exists for using the job as an override at the current time.&nbsp; The one exception to this is the Quote viewer which will use the Client Site's security for Quotes that do not refer to a specific job.</P>
 <H3>2.12.2 Hard Block on Branch Filtering</H3>
 <P>This functionality is implemented via the following registry option:</P>
 <P><FONT style="font-weight:bold; " >BranchFilterWithHardBlock=true</FONT></P>
 <P>The user should experience no behavior changes relative to the use of branches without the new registry setting.&nbsp; The only noticeable difference would be that several record viewers include a new 'ByBranchId' sort option.</P>
 <P>Implementing the new registry setting causes Branch Filtering to behave similarly to Security Filtering: even if the user clears the Branch Id range, only those Branches that match his or her Branch filter (in the User record) will appear. One significant difference is that a blank Branch Id is not treated as global record.</P>
 <P>The Client Site, Employee, Invoice Master, Job, Quote, Scheduled Event, User, Vendor, Vendor Invoice and Work Order records are impacted by this registry entry. </P>
 <P>Hard Block Branch Filtering is also implemented for Create PM WO’s &amp; Create PM Billing: Even if the user clears the Branch Id range when running these functions, only those Branches that match his or her Branch filter (in the User record) will appear if this following registry option is in effect. </P>
 <P>This case does NOT currently extend to reporting, except for: </P>
 <P style="margin-left:36.00pt;"> <FONT style="font-weight:bold; " >Service Invoice:</FONT> this enhancement applies the hard-block on a User's Branch Filter to service invoicing so that a user cannot produce service invoices for WOs not included in the user's branch filter definition. <BR></P>
 <H3>2.12.3 Specify a Branch Prefix in Record Id’s</H3>
 <P>This registry option enables you to prepend the Branch Prefix (from the Branch record) to various SAMPRO auto-sequenced Id fields.&nbsp; For example, if &quot;CL&quot; is the prefix for the Cleveland branch, then each work order created for Cleveland could begin with CL followed by the next sequential work order number IF the registry entry (below) is implemented. NOTE: this enhancement DOES NOT implement separate record sequencers by branch.&nbsp; Consider the case of a company with branches in Cleveland, Columbus and Cincinnati.&nbsp; Standard SAMPRO code would assign Work Order Ids sequentially based on the value contained in the database table named nextwo.&nbsp; Code from this case would take the &quot;standard&quot; sequential value and prefix it with the appropriate branch prefix.&nbsp; The actual work order id assignments might look like this ...<BR>&nbsp; CL100001&nbsp; (Cleveland)<BR>&nbsp; CI100002&nbsp; (Cincinnati)<BR>&nbsp; CL100003&nbsp; (Cleveland)<BR>&nbsp; CO100004&nbsp; (Columbus)</P>
 <P>The code that determines which branch prefix to use varies depending on the record.&nbsp;In order to implement the branch prefixing discussed above, the following registry option must be in place: </P>
 <P><FONT style="font-weight:bold; " >Contents</FONT>:&nbsp;<FONT style="font-weight:bold; " >BranchSequence=</FONT><FONT style="font-style:italic; " >&quot;a comma-delimited list of sequencer tables that should be prefixed&quot;</FONT></P>
 <P>This feature was implemented in a general way.&nbsp; That means any of the sequencers (except nextrn) can be prefixed.&nbsp; For example, including 'nextapjrnl' in the list would cause the AP Journal Ids to get prefixed.</P>
 <P style="margin-left:36.00pt;"><FONT style="font-weight:bold; text-decoration:underline;" >Example:</FONT> to implement prefixing for invoices, work orders, quotes and purchase orders, the global settings options would look like this: </P>
 <P style="margin-left:36.00pt;"><FONT style="font-weight:bold; " >BranchSequence=nextinvce,nextwo,nextqte,nextprchseordr</FONT></P>
 <P style="margin-left:66.25pt;"><FONT style="font-weight:bold; " >Important Note: The Source of the Branch Id<BR></FONT>There are two potential sources for the Branch Prefix in any given viewer Add Record scenario.&nbsp; First, the record being added might actually have its own Branch Id.&nbsp; This would be the case in the Work Order and Purchase Orders for example.&nbsp; Second, the User doing the data entry might have a Branch Id specified in their User Account record.&nbsp; The basic intention is to use the record's own branch first and the user's second.</P>
 <H3>2.12.4 Branch Id Override for National Call Center processing</H3>
 <P>The Branch override processing has been implemented for the following functions so that the Branch of the new record is determined by the Branch of the Job (if present), not the User.  The Branch override processing has been implemented for the following functions ...</P>
 <P>1. New Call<BR>2. Purchase Orders created in the PO viewer, from Generate Purchase Order, as a part of PM and New Call processing, Quotemaster and Materials Requisitioning, from TechAnywhere and SubAnywhere.<BR>3. Work Orders created in the Work Order Viewer and from Quotemaster, TechAnywhere and SubAnywhere.<BR>4. Quote viewer (and Work Orders and PO’s generated from the Quote)<BR>5. Create PM WOs<BR>6. Create PM Billing<BR>7. Record Billing Adjustments</P>
 <P>This new feature is turned on by registry entry.&nbsp; The following entry implements the override globally for the functions noted above.</P>
 <P><FONT style="font-weight:bold; " >Contents: BranchOverrideFrom=job</FONT></P>
 <P>If a global override isn't desired, the individual functions can be controlled by making the ‘BranchOverrideFrom' entry in the registry entries specific to given functions. Note that support only exists for using the job as an override at the current time.&nbsp; The one exception to this is the Quote viewer which will use the Client Site's security for Quotes that do not refer to a specific job.</P>
 <P style="margin-left:36.00pt;"><FONT style="font-weight:bold; " >Important Note on Branch Defaulting:</FONT><FONT style="font-weight:bold; " > <BR></FONT>When the registry entry is set to use the Job's Branch, there is no fallback to the Branch in the User account if the Branch in the Job record is blank.</P>
 <H3>2.12.5 Prepaid Sales / Use Tax included in inventoried cost</H3>
 <P style="margin-top:0.00pt;">This change allows the 'use' taxes that are included on inventory purchases to become part of the inventoried cost.&nbsp; This concept is an extension of the work done for SAMPRO Canadian installations – <FONT style="color:blue; text-decoration:underline;" >http://fogbugz.sampro.net:3000/fogbugz/default.asp?pg=pgEditBug&amp;command=view&amp;ixBug=1282</FONT>it allows PST to be treated as part of the inventoried cost.</P>
 <P style="margin-top:0.00pt;">Basically, if you purchase inventory to stock and associate the purchase to a Sales Tax Group that has one or more Authorities marked as Job Cost = True, then the inventoried cost includes the purchase price plus the tax associated with the JC=True authorities. Registry option to implement for ‘Job Cost’ tax authorities:</P>

 <H3>2.12.6 Dispatch Board – registry setting to disable auto-update functionality</H3>
 <P>This registry entry allows users to create a list of WO statuses that are exempt from the auto status change feature we currently employ on the Dispatch Board. This registry entry ONLY impacts technician changes made on the Dispatch Board. Currently, when a user changes the assigned tech on a work order, the system sets the status for the newly assigned tech to the initial start value (unassigned or Waiting Service). There are cases where you wouldn't want this to happen i.e. if the original status was Waiting Parts and you assigned the WO to a different tech you would still want the new tech's status to be Waiting Parts. <FONT style="font-weight:bold; font-style:italic; " >Note that if you are running escalation </FONT><FONT style="font-weight:bold; font-style:italic; " >manager</FONT><FONT style="font-weight:bold; font-style:italic; " >, this registry entry should be carefully considered for possible impact with your escalation profiles. </FONT></P>

 <H3>2.12.7 Registry setting to adjust State Id / Province Entry</H3>
 <P>By default, data entry in the State / Province address field is limit to the official abbreviations of the US States and Canadian Provinces. By implementing one of the following registry entries, you may disable or adjust this behavior.  </P>
 <P><FONT style="font-weight:bold; " >DisableStateIdValidation=true</FONT><BR>This setting disables the State/Province Id validations.</P>
 <P><FONT style="font-weight:bold; " >ValidStateIds=</FONT><FONT style="font-weight:bold; font-style:italic; " >comma-delimited list of State Id values</FONT><FONT style="font-weight:bold; " ><BR></FONT>This setting serves as a total replacement for Sampro’s standard list of State and Canadian Province Ids.</P>
 <P><FONT style="font-weight:bold; " >OtherValidStateIds=</FONT><FONT style="font-weight:bold; font-style:italic; " >comma-delimited list of State Id values<BR></FONT>This setting appends additional State Ids to the standard list. For example, if your company does business in other countries, you may wish to add these country codes.</P>
 <P style="margin-left:36.00pt;"><FONT style="text-decoration:underline;" >Example:</FONT></P>
 <P style="margin-left:36.00pt;">To add Mexico, Great Britain and France: </P>
 <P style="margin-left:36.00pt;">OtherValidStateIds=MX,GB,FR</P>
 <P style="margin-left:36.00pt;">The validation logic doesn't accommodate lowercase letters so the registry values should be entered in uppercase.</P>
 <H3>2.12.8 Inventory Revenue Based on Last Cost </H3>
 <P><FONT style="font-weight:bold; " >InventoryRevenueFromLast=true</FONT></P>
 <P>This setting forces revenue calculations for inventory parts <FONT style="text-decoration:underline;" >not</FONT> flagged as Use Unit Price to perform the markup based on Last Overall Cost (for any location) regardless of costing method chosen in part record. Inventory that is flagged as Use Unit Price will continue to have the revenue calculated at the unit price.</P>
 <H3>2.12.9 Defer Tax Status Decision </H3>
 <P>This registry entry, when implemented, would result in the Sale tax type (for Job Tax Statuses of Unknown, Sales and Exempt) always defaults to space n/a so that the tax would be calculated at invoicing. This registry option does NOT pertain to Jobs with a Sale Tax Type of Use; Use type jobs will be handled as usual.</P>
 <P>To implement globally in sys-ffv-global-settings:</P>
 <P><FONT style="font-weight:bold; " >Additional Contents: </FONT>DeferTaxStatusDecision=true</P>
 <P>Alternately, this registry option may be implement on a viewer by viewer basis (e.g., in the sys-viewer-vwrkordr to implement in work orders). </P>
 <P>Note: to prevent users from altering the Tax Type in, for example, the Work Order viewer, make the appropriate registry entries to disable the Tax Type fields.</P>
 <H3>2.12.10  Global Default GL Account</H3>
 <P>When this setting is in place, any attempt to write a new record to the GL History where a GL Account is not specified will use the GL Account specified by this entry instead.  A valid GL Account Id must be specified in this entry. </P>
 <P><FONT style="font-weight:bold; " >Additional Contents:</FONT> DefaultGLAccountId=<FONT style="font-style:italic; " >GL Account Id</FONT></P>
 <P>For example, this could happen if the user printed and posted a construction-type invoice with Retainage $$$ but NO Retainage GL Account. Without this entry, the post would be to the blank GL Account. With this entry, the Retainage dollars would be written to the account defined in this entry, making it easier to find and correct errors. Note that the Job Invoice Posting report does not yet display the Default Global Account. </P>
 <H2>2.13 Sampro Reports – Registry Entry Control for Extra Lines on COP Invoice</H2>
 <P>This new functionality for Smalltalk reports was implemented to correct a COP Invoice problem that occurred when 7 detail lines were printed and then the total lines were not hitting within the bitmap total box. The registryExtraLinesForView~orderitem=1 forces the 7<FONT style="vertical-align:super; " >th</FONT> line to the next page, resulting in the totals being positioned correctly. </P>

 <P>This enhancement provides a registry option that, when implemented, replaces the User Id with the Security Id when managing sticky field values.  When this registry entry is first implemented, the sticky fields will initially be blank because their contents are not yet associated with a Security Id. This registry setting should be applied on a viewer-by-viewer basis and within a viewer would apply equally to ALL the viewer's sticky fields.&nbsp; In other words, the setting does not support selecting specific fields.&nbsp; Also note that this enhancement is by Security Id, not Security Id by User Id.

 <P>The system now supports the MICR printing of checks on Troy printers with security features, MICR ink, and signature printing. New registry settings are required. These are in the registry entry that corresponds to the check printing function:</P>
 <P><FONT style="font-weight:bold; " >sys-report-rapchck</FONT></P>
 <P><FONT style="font-weight:bold; " >sys-report-rprchck</FONT></P>
 <P><FONT style="font-weight:bold; " >sys-report-rprmdchck</FONT></P>
 <P>To trigger MICR printing for the check, use</P>
 <P><FONT style="font-weight:bold; " >UseMICR = yes<BR></FONT>(Actually any value beginning with ‘y’, ‘Y’, ‘t’, or ‘T’ will do) </P>
 <P>To force a double signature line on an AP check for amounts exceeding $10,000 (for example) use<BR><FONT style="font-weight:bold; " > &nbsp;DoubleSignatureAmount = 10000</FONT></P>
 <P>To print the company name ‘XYZ Incorporated’ (for example) below the underline, use<BR><FONT style="font-weight:bold; " > &nbsp;CompanyName = XYZ Incorporated</FONT></P>
 <P>If this entry is absent, the standard company name string will be used.</P>
 <P>When a Troy printer containing a signature device is used, you must configure the printer to map the ‘Times New Roman’ font to the proper Troy signature font.  A Troy printer is not required to test this mod. However the MICR line and the signature will not properly print otherwise.</P>
 <H3>2.24.1 AP Checks – Pay to the Order Of option for custom checks:</H3>

 <P style="margin-left:36.00pt;">PAY TO THE ORDER OF value is extracted from the first line of the check's mailing address.&nbsp; The value is printed two lines above the spelled-out check amount.&nbsp; It is indented from the left margin approximately the same as the mailing address so as to accommodate pre-printed check forms.</P>
 <P style="margin-left:36.00pt;">This new option is available to anyone using either the standard AP Check form or the standard MICR form.&nbsp; Users with custom AP Check formats will be required to request a separate modification for their forms.</P>

 <P>A new 401(k) Report has been implemented for use with John Hancock. For the date range that you specify, it lists the Branch Id, Employee, Social Security Number, Check Date, Gross Wages, Withheld (amount of 401(k) withheld), Match (company 401(k) matching funds), Loan 1 and Loan 2. </P>
 <P>The report input fields include the Start and End Dates, and a Branch Filter.</P>
 <P>Note: the Type in the Deduction Records MUST be set to 401(k) for deductions to appear on this report. </P>
 <P>This Registry entry is required in order to run 401(k) reports except for the Cigna report (which has its own registry entry).  If the report is to be run by operating company (for example, if each operating company uses a different plan id,  or has a different matching percent),  you must make a different registry for each operating company you intend to run the report for. </P>
 <P><FONT style="font-weight:bold; " >Id:</FONT> <BR>The Id of the Registry Entry is formatted as follows – note that the base entry must include a hyphen at the end: </P>

 <H1>3. AP and Purchasing</H1>
 <P>This release implements vendor-based Sales Tax Group processing; the goal here is to permit separate Tax Groups for incoming and outgoing invoices on the same job.</P>
 <H2>3.1 Vendor Record</H2>
 <H3>3.1.1 Main Tab</H3>
 <P><FONT style="font-weight:bold; " >New Field: Tax Group Id:<BR></FONT>This field provides a default value for Purchases. It should only be completed if the applicable tax rules should come from the Vendor where you purchased the items in the case of buying / selling in difference tax entities; this may be the case in certain Canadian scenarios. </P>
 <P><FONT style="font-weight:bold; " >Add Alt Mail Address Button<BR></FONT>Addresses added to the Alt Mail Address Tab via this button will also be available to the Purchase Order Viewer’s Remit To tab.</P>
 <P><FONT style="font-weight:bold; " >Service Provider Rates: Rate Schedule Id:<BR></FONT>If foreign currency processing is implemented on your system, the Rate Schedule should be maintained in the currency of the subcontractor.</P>
 <H3>3.1.2 Alt Mailing Address Tab</H3>
 <P>Addresses added add to this Tab (via the Alt Mail Address button on the Main tab)  will also be available to the Purchase Order Viewer’s Remit To tab.</P>
 <H3>3.1.3 Open Invoices Tab</H3>
 <P>A new tab, Open Invoices, has been added to the Vendor view. This tab displays open vendor invoices and credit memos that have not been fully paid / cleared.  A Summary 'To Date' line appears as the first entry in the list.</P>
 <P>The following fields are displayed for each open invoice / credit memo; note that credit memos appear with a negative dollar value owed.</P>
 <P><FONT style="font-weight:bold; " >Invoice No - PO Id – Invoice Date – Due Date – Pay Date – Purchases – Amount Owed – Due Next 30 – Past Due – Payments – Discount Taken – Retainage – Invoice Date Aging – Days Past Due</FONT></P>
 <P>The Amount Owed is calculated as follows:  Purchases - Payments - DiscTaken - Retainage = AmountOwed</P>
 <P style="margin-top:0;margin-bottom:0">&nbsp;</P>
 <H2>3.2 Purchase Order</H2>
 <P>The new PO form is now cleared properly when accessed from WO Create PO button.</P>
 <P>If the registry option WOInvoicedWarning= was set to all or header the Save button on the PO was disabled.  The Save button is now enabled so that the user can change the PO after the warning is displayed.  </P>
 <P>PO’s with a status of Released may now be marked as Closed in the Purchase Order viewer. This change conforms to the A/P functionality where a PO could be set to &quot;Closed&quot; when the PO status was “Released.”  In previous releases, you couldn't close a PO in the Purchase Order viewer unless the PO status was &quot;Printed&quot;.&quot;</P>
 <P>In previous releases, the closed filter of the PO viewer was automatically set so that the following range fields were set as follows: Received-in-Full: ‘Y’ and Vouchered-in-Full: ‘Y’. This filtering is obsolete. In this release,  these ranges are blank for the Closed filtering option.</P>
 <P>The system now defaults sales tax group from Vendor record to PO's auto-created by the following functions: New Call (for subcontractor vendors), Create PM Work Orders (for subcontractor vendors), Start Generate Purchase Orders and the Quote Master Approval Wizard.</P>
 <P>The Currency Factor is now set correctly when PO's are generated by the following functions: Start Generate Purchase Orders, Start Create PM Workorders (sub po's) and New Call (sub po's). When setting the Currency Factor, the system uses the PO Date Released to get the currency factor from the Currency Master record. If the released date is empty it then uses the current date.</P>
 <P>Corrects rounding error that sometimes occurred when a quantity with 3 decimal places was specified. </P>
 <P><FONT style="font-weight:bold; " >WO Id in PO Header</FONT> <BR>The software now denies changes to the WO Id in the PO parent whenever the PO has any lines - received or not.&nbsp; If a PO is entered with the wrong info, the user will be required to take the necessary steps to cancel it and enter the correct info as a new PO. </P>
 <P><FONT style="font-weight:bold; " >Lines Imported to Work Order<BR></FONT>The system now displays a warning if user attempts to change lines imported to a work order. This enhancement applies to both General and Inventory lines.&nbsp; A warning has been added when any of the following activities are attempted on a line that has already been imported into a work order: </P>
 <P style="margin-left:36.00pt;">1. deleting the line<BR>2. canceling the line<BR>3. changing either the quantity ordered or received to something less than the quantity imported.</P>
 <P style="margin-left:36.00pt;">In addition, the Quantity Imported into the WO is displayed on the full screen view for both General and Inventory Purchase Order  lines.</P>
 <H3>3.2.0 Printed Purchase Order </H3>
 <P>All amounts on the printed PO form will appear in the foreign currency of the Vendor.</P>
 <P>The Currency Abbreviation (from the Currency Master record) will appear on to the right of the Estimated Total.</P>
 <P>The printed Purchase Order has been enhanced to include the words ‘Credit PO’ after the PO Id when a Credit PO is printed. For example,  ‘110011 Credit PO’. </P>
 <P>When a Change Order is printed, the Change Order Id and the Id of the Purchase Order (or Credit PO) will both be listed: 11013-01 replaces 11013. Note that the existing verbiage ‘This is a Change Order’ will continue to be printed on Change Orders as before. </P>

 <P><FONT style="font-weight:bold; " >Purchase Order Remit-To Address:</FONT>   <FONT style="font-weight:bold; " > Vendor Mailing Address:<BR></FONT>By default, the AP Check to pay the Vendor will be sent to the Vendor Mailing Address (which defaults from the Vendor record).

 <P>Corrects a problem with AP Journal edits to split stock/job po's resulted in history being writing to wrong location for the stock items.</P>
 <P>The AP Journal entries and the history records they generate will now assume the Security Id of the Purchase Order used to generate them. </P>
 <P>This version corrects a problem where, if a PO had the same exact description of the item in the General AND Inventory tabs, the AP Journal vouchering process doubled up the quantity on the General Tab of the AP Journal. </P>
 <P>The software now skips the update to the PO record when the AP Journal doesn't include a reference to a PO but the user has set the Close PO box. </P>
 <P>The Paid to Date field is now updated with Retainage payments. In previous versions, paid Retainage amounts were not included in the calculation of this field. </P>

 <H3>3.7.1 AP Processing in a multi-user environment</H3>
 <P>Previous releases allowed you to change the Vendor invoice number when the check report was open - but the user had not confirmed / posted the run. If you then ran checks again, a check for the 'new' invoice # would appear. To prevent this problem, validations have been added to prevent records that are ‘in use’ by Print AP Check from being changed. The AP Check run skips any records already in use.&nbsp; Records not already in use that qualify for the check run are then marked to prevent other users from using them.&nbsp; When the check printing process terminates, the in-use condition is cleared for all relevant invoices. </P>
 <P>The following functions are also sensitive to the in-use condition: </P>
 <P style="margin-left:36.00pt;">- Select Invoices for Payment (Start Vendor Date to Pay List) skips in-use Vendor Invoices</P>
 <P style="margin-left:36.00pt;">- The AP Journal viewer denies changes to transactions that reference in-use Vendor Invoices.</P>

 <P style="margin-left:36.00pt;">-  Start PWP Approved List skips any records already in use.</P>
 <P>During the login process, an attempt is made to clean up the in-use Vendor Invoices in the event a previous SAMPRO session terminated abnormally.</P>

 <P style="margin-left:72.00pt;">The following Work Orders cannot be invoiced.<BR>Each has one or more JCH entries that:<BR>do not contain a Billing Item or<BR>reference a Billing Item that is not flagged as Ok to Bill.</P>
 <P>If the billing item was not flagged as ‘Ok to Bill’, simply flag it and rerun the invoice.</P>
 <P>To correct this situation if a billing item is missing, contact your support representative. </P>
 <P>To prevent these problems in the future:</P>
 <P style="margin-left:36.00pt;">Contact your support representative for a registry entry to make the Billing Item a required field in New Call.  You may also wish to make the Billing Item a required field in the Job Cost Code, and the Client Site Equipment record (default service job). </P>
 <P style="margin-top:0;margin-bottom:0">&nbsp;</P>
 <H2>4.4 AR Sales Journal</H2>
 <P>When manual changes to the AR Sales Journal are written back to the Invoice Master, the Invoice Master’s change log is now updated with the date and time the user edited the sales journal, and the sales journal’s transaction number is also referenced in the change log description.</P>
 <P><FONT style="font-weight:bold; " >Invoice Id:<BR></FONT>The AR Sales Journal no longer allows an Invoice Id with leading blanks to be entered. This was causing problems downstream in the AR Cash Receipts Journal. </P>
 <P>The software now allows edits of AR Sales Journal Credit Memos.</P>
 <P>Implements Security overrides (if SecurityOverrideFrom=job is set in sys-ffv-global-settings) for manually created Sales Journal entries. Also implements setting the Branch Rn from the User record (if BranchOverrideFrom=job is NOT set) for manually created Sales Journal entries. </P>
 <H3>4.4.1. New Functionality: Create a Credit Memo from AR Sales Journal Entry</H3>
 <P>A new button labeled 'Create Credit Memo' has been added to the Main tab of the Sales Journal; clicking this button will generate a Credit Memo for the associated Sales Journal entry.&nbsp; Use of this new functionality is limited to transactions with an Entry Type of 'Sales'.&nbsp; When the new button is pushed, the system will execute the following:</P>
 <P style="margin-left:36.00pt;">1. Ask the user to confirm that they wish to create a Credit Memo.</P>
 <P style="margin-left:36.00pt;">2. Switch the transaction mode from Change to Add.</P>
 <P style="margin-left:36.00pt;">3. Revise the Invoice Id by appending the letters 'CM' to the existing Invoice Id.&nbsp; If the Invoice Master table already has a record for the new Invoice Id, then try 'CM2', 'CM3', etc.</P>
 <P style="margin-left:36.00pt;">4. Set the Entry Type to 'Credit Memo'.</P>
 <P style="margin-left:36.00pt;">5. Set the Accounting Period Id to the default period.</P>
 <P style="margin-left:36.00pt;">6. Set the Invoice Date to the current system date as long as it satisfies the Accounting Period's date specifications.&nbsp; If the current date doesn't work, use either the Start or End date from the Accounting Period depending on which is closer to the current date.</P>
 <P style="margin-left:36.00pt;">7. Clear the Transaction Id so that the user can save the new transaction.</P>
 <H3>4.4.2 Price Tab</H3>
 <P><FONT style="font-weight:bold; " >Tax Info Fields:<BR></FONT>If this line was generated or manually entered to record a sales or use tax revenue and the Revenue Type Id is set to ‘tax’,  one or more of these fields will/should be completed. If more that one Tax Authority is included in the Tax Group referenced by this invoice, one Price line should exist for each Tax Authority.  </P>
 <P style="margin-left:72.00pt;"><FONT style="font-weight:bold; " >Use Tax:  </FONT>Revenue subject to use tax is written to tax history when materials are entered on the work order for a use tax job, not when the work order is invoiced.

 <P><FONT style="font-weight:bold; " >Tax Base:<BR></FONT>The dollar amount being used to calculate the sales tax recorded on this line in the Amount field. The Tax Base may be equal to or less than the Invoice Amount.  For example, if material is taxable but labor is not, material revenue would be included in the Tax Base but labor revenue would not be.</P>

 <P><FONT style="font-weight:bold; " >Posted to TXH:<BR></FONT>This display-only field is checked if this line has been posted to the Tax History table. </P>
 <P><FONT style="font-weight:bold; " >Invoice Amount:<BR></FONT>The Invoice amount for this line. If taxes are assessed differently for different components of the invoice (for example, labor and materials), this amount will not equal the total invoice amount being billed. </P>
 <P><FONT style="font-weight:bold; " >Exempt Amount:<BR></FONT>The amount of the sales that is tax exempt.  Typically, if the Client is tax exempt, the Exempt Amount would equal the Invoice Amount, and the Tax Base would be zero.</P>

 <H3>4.4.3 GL Tab </H3>
 <P>The system now denies changes to COD type AR Sales Journal entries that have been processed in the Bank Deposit Journal. The message “This COD sale has already been deposited. Changes to this transaction are not allowed.” Note that the user may still use the Credit Memo button to generate a Credit Memo (as this creates a NEW entry). </P>
 <P><FONT style="font-weight:bold; " >New Fields: Bank Deposit:<BR>Transaction Id: Effective Date:</FONT></P>
 <P>If this is a COD-type Sales Journal Entry  (with the Cash Receipt fields completed), the system will display the Bank Deposit information that is record when the COD funds are  recorded in the Bank Deposit Journal. The system denies changes to entries that have been processed in the Bank Deposit Journal.</P>
 <H2>4.5 AR Cash Receipts</H2>
 <P>Enhanced validation now prevents the simultaneous use of the Cash Receipts and Bank Deposit journals from resulting in inappropriate changes being made. The user may be asked to refresh a screen or restart a transaction if needed. </P>
 <P>The Cash Receipts Journal now allows the header and line Client Ids to be different.&nbsp; This allows cash receipts to be recorded for the client that received the invoice.&nbsp; Previously, the AR Cash Receipts Journal Entries couldn't be recorded without switching the Job Client Id back to match the original invoice.</P>
 <P>Only those invoices allowed by the user’s Security Setting will be displayed. </P>
 <P>The work order id (if present) associated with an AR Invoice is now displayed in the last column of the lower pane selection list of the AR Cash Receipts Journal. </P>
 <H3>4.5.1 Other and AR Tabs Added</H3>
 <P>Two new tabs, AR and Other, have been added to the AR Cash Receipts tab. </P>
 <P><FONT style="font-weight:bold; " >New Tab: AR<BR></FONT>This tab displays the invoices and cm’s selected from the lower section. In previous releases, this was simply the center pane of the screen and did not have a tab label. </P>
 <P><FONT style="font-weight:bold; " >New Tab: Other</FONT></P>
 <P>This tab would be used if you need to record a cash receipt where only a partial amount of the check applies to your company’s invoices. To do so, select the applicable Invoices (which will then appear on the AR tab), and then record the remaining balance on the &quot;Other&quot; tab to another account(s). This will allow your deposits and bank reconciliations to be accurate. <FONT style="font-weight:bold; " >Note that transactions recorded on the Other tab will be recorded to GL history only; not AR History. </FONT></P>
 <P><FONT style="font-weight:bold; " >Amount:<BR></FONT>The excess Amount received that is NOT being applied to invoices on the AR tab. </P>
 <P><FONT style="font-weight:bold; " >GL Account:<BR></FONT>The account for the excess. For example, this could be the liability account being credited.  </P>
 <P><FONT style="font-weight:bold; " >GL Entity:<BR></FONT>The Entity being charged with the excess amount.</P>
 <P><FONT style="font-weight:bold; " >Description:<BR></FONT>A brief description of the entry (highly recommended). </P>
 <H2>4.6 Client Site Equipment viewer</H2>
 <P><FONT style="font-weight:bold; " >Inventory Id:<BR></FONT>Corrects an SQL Server issue that sometimes occurred when a user completed the Inventory Item Id field. When the system auto-populated the Component tab from the Item’s BOM table, an error would occur if the Equipment Size was set to zero.</P>
 <P><FONT style="font-weight:bold; " >Get PM Schedule button</FONT></P>
 <P>Corrects a problem where lines were not being imported correctly if a Master Contract was referenced in the site. This function now also excludes lines referencing a Master Contract. This enables you to set up and copy ‘extra’ PM’s that are not a part of a particular Master Contract. </P>
 <P><FONT style="font-weight:bold; " >Equipment Size: </FONT><FONT style="font-weight:bold; " ><BR></FONT>This release resolves field size discrepancies in the Client Site Equipment, Inventory Item, and Equipment Master records. All are now 10 characters to the left of the decimal point and two to the right.  </P>
 <H2>4.7 Construction Invoicing</H2>
 <P>This release corrects a problem that a customer encountered when x’ing out of a construction invoice and then attempting to access the job in Record Billing Adjustments. </P>
 <P>This build corrects a problem where construction invoices for exempt jobs were not correctly writing to the Tax History. The rules in the current image are as follows: </P>
 <P style="margin-left:36.00pt;">1. Job Tax Status is 'Sales' and Fixed Fee Taxable is True, then Fee Amount is 'sales taxable'.<BR>2. Job Tax Status is 'Exempt' and Fixed Fee Taxable is True, then Fee Amount is 'tax exempt'.<BR>3. In all other cases, Fee Amount is 'not taxable'.</P>
 <P><FONT style="font-weight:bold; " >Note</FONT><FONT style="font-weight:bold; " > on Sales Tax and Billing Items</FONT><FONT style="font-weight:bold; " >:</FONT> Sales Tax is a job-level calculation.&nbsp; Sales Tax assignment doesn't try to be Billing Item specific. The Tax Line's Cost Code is set by looking for the Cost Code marked as Default for AR Post = True.&nbsp; If an 'AR default' isn't found, SQL retrieves a Cost Code at random (probably the one with the smallest jbcstcde_rn) and sets the Tax Line's Cost Code from that.&nbsp; </P>
 <P>The User Id (of the User running the report) and Company Name (from the Company Name registry entry) have been added to the header of the Job Invoice Post and Job Invoice Reverse reports. </P>
 <P><FONT style="font-weight:bold; " >RINVINV3 – Canadian Format:</FONT> the Canadian format includes a change to explicitly show  the calculation of GST not including Retainage.  Available in RININV3.rpt dated 2/6/2006 and later. </P>
 <H3>4.7.1 Record Billing Adjustments</H3>
 <P>If the Billing Item's Original Contract Amount or Contract Change amount is negative, when you enter 100% for the contract earned percentage, the total now equals the value exactly instead of being off by a few cents.</P>
 <P>Additional error checking during data entry in the Record Billing Adjustments and Job Billing Item viewers to disallow changes based on a Billing Item's OK-to-Bill status. </P>
 <P>This function now recognizes and uses the security and branch override from job registry settings in sys-ffv-global-settings. </P>
 <P><IMG src="images/computegl.gif" align=left border=0 height=17 width=77 alt="images\computegl.gif"> The Compute GL button now understands there might be a GL Income Account in the Cost Category and includes it in the computations. The revenue is allocated to GL Accounts based on the cost codes and/or cost categories that have posted to JCH.</P>
 <P style="margin-left:36.00pt;"><FONT style="font-weight:bold; " >Background Information:</FONT></P>
 <P style="margin-left:36.00pt;">There are four allocation schemes that could potentially be used in RBA when the COMPUTE GL button is pushed.&nbsp; The first one that 'qualifies' is the one used for any given billing item.&nbsp; The possibilities, in order of precedence, are ...<BR><BR>1. Budgeted Revenue by Billing Item, Cost Code, GL Account<BR>2. Unbilled Costs by Billing Item, Cost Code, GL Account<BR>3. Projected Costs by Billing Item, Cost Code, GL Account<BR>4. Budgeted Costs by Billing Item, Cost Code, GL Account<BR><BR><FONT style="font-weight:bold; " >NOTE:<BR></FONT>When none of the above allocation schemes can be used, the Cost Code designated as the Default for AR is used.&nbsp; If there is no default, then the cost code with the lowest Id is used.</P>
 <H2>4.8 Client Viewer</H2>
 <P>The left button bar now displays correctly when you return to the main Client screen from the Collections view by clicking the Parent button. </P>
 <H3>4.8.1 Client Collections Invoice Screen</H3>
 <P>This release<FONT style="font-weight:bold; " > </FONT>corrects a problem where a check scanned in the AR Cash Receipts was displayed instead of the invoice because it was the most recent document associated with that invoice. </P>
 <P>Display of Credit Memos and Unapplied Case Receipts:  Prior to this case, values in the column titled InvAmt showed as a positive amount for both Credit Memo and Unapplied Cash transactions.&nbsp; These amounts have been changed to negative values.  </P>
 <H2>4.9 Create PM Billings</H2>
 <P>This build ensures that any PM Billing lines generated from Master Contracts are correctly processed. Support has also been added for security and branch override by Job set via registry SecurityOverrideFrom=job and BranchOverrideFrom=job options in sys-ffv-global-settings.<FONT style="font-weight:bold; " >  Note that any GL Accruals generated during PM Billing will be assigned the Security Id of the individual running the function, NOT the Security Id of the Job. </FONT></P>
 <P>Also corrects sporadic problem where all invoice master records pointed at the same job.</P>
 <P><FONT style="font-weight:bold; " >Hard Block Branch Filtering:</FONT> Even if the user clears the Branch Id range when running this function, only those Branches that match his or her Branch filter (in the User record) will appear if the following registry setting is in effect:  Id: sys-ffv-global-settings   Contents: BranchFilterWithHardBlock=true.</P>
 <P>A performance enhancement has been implemented allowing this function to run more quickly. </P>
 <P><FONT style="font-weight:bold; " >Create PM Billing Spreadsheet</FONT></P>
 <P>When this function is run, the system will now generate a .cvs file listing the results of this function. This report will be loaded into the directory specified by the dbreportfiles registry option. It will list the following information:</P>
 <P>Bill Date - Amount Billed - Amount Earned - Site Name - Site Id - Invoice Description - Invoice Id</P>
 <P>Billing entries that include only the amortization of the revenue are listed at the beginning of the report, and will be indicated as such. </P>
 <H2>4.10 Start Job Invoice Reverse</H2>
 <P>Corrects spurious error message ‘The job COD is not a template record’ that displayed when you attempted to reverse a COD work order invoice. </P>
 <P>The currency factor is now set to 1.0 if a currency Id was not specified for reversed COD invoices.</P>
 <P>The Job Invoice Reverse function now posts the reversing Sales Journal entry using the Client Id from the original invoice instead of the Job Client Id.&nbsp; </P>
 <H2>4.11&nbsp;Tax History Table</H2>
 <P>This table was added in version 7.1 to enable better sales tax reporting for our developers and for third-party products such as Crystal Reports. Sales, exempt, and use tax information will be written to this table when you invoice customers and voucher purchase orders (entering taxes on the Taxes tab) <FONT style="font-weight:bold; " >after</FONT> upgrading to this version. </P>
 <P><FONT style="font-weight:bold; " >Access to this </FONT><FONT style="font-weight:bold; " >table should</FONT><FONT style="font-weight:bold; " > limited to read-only access for </FONT><FONT style="font-weight:bold; " >report-writers. </FONT>Contact your support representative for additional information. </P>
 <P>Note that the new Sales Tax Summary by State by Group report runs off of the contents of this table. </P>
 <H2>4.12 New Report: Sales Tax Summary by Tax Group</H2>

 <P>&nbsp;Diff = Computed – (Tax Invoiced + Use Tax)</P>
 <H2>4.13 Service Billing</H2>
 <P>Corrects a Checklist display problem for Compute Service Worksheet / Invoice. The screen was not refreshed correctly if the Print box was moved – the first line incorrectly displayed the last line’s information. </P>
 <P><FONT style="font-weight:bold; " >Revised Report: </FONT><FONT style="font-weight:bold; " >Service Invoice Post Report</FONT>  </P>
 <P>This corrects a cosmetic problem on this report for negative service invoices. The amount posted to AR account on the top of the report displayed as a negative credit, and the Invoice Total on the upper portion of the report was also incorrect. Install the updated serviceinvoicepost.rpt to correct these problems. </P>
 <H2>4.14 Report AR Collections (DARCLLCTN.rpt)</H2>
 <P>An enhanced version of this report is now available that handles the problem where a collection note was recorded with only the summary filled in, not the body of the note. In the updated report, the summary line will be listed, regardless of whether any body text was included in the collection note. This report must be imported into your data to see this change. </P>
 <H2>4.15 Consolidated Invoices</H2>
 <P>When adding Invoices manually to the AR Invoices tab, the system now verifies that the invoice status is set to Posted. </P>
 <H2>4.16 Compute Finance Charges: </H2>
 <P>This release corrects an SQL Server error that occurred when running this function.   </P>
 <H2>4.17 Job Invoice Post</H2>
 <P>This function now supports the SecurityOverrideFrom=job functionality implemented in the sys-ffv-global-setting registry. </P>
 <H1>5. GL</H1>
 <H2>5.1 GL Account History Report</H2>
 <P>If multinational currency is implemented on your system, be aware of the following when reading this report:</P>
 <P>A. A/P and A/R Control and Retainage Accounts for Foreign Currency Vendors/Clients:</P>
 <P>&nbsp;These will be maintained in the ‘original amount’ of the foreign currency</P>
 <P>B. Inventory Expense Accounts</P>
 <P style="margin-left:36.00pt;">These accounts will be maintained in your firm’s local currency. Foreign currency amounts will have been converted to your local currency using the Currency Factor in the AP Journal.</P>
 <P>C. Foreign Exchange / Currency Adjustment Accounts</P>
 <P>&nbsp;These will balance the difference between A &amp; B (see above).</P>
 <H2>5.2 Clear Checks</H2>
 <P>The Shift-tab key combination now moves the caret to the previous field as it should in Clear Checks, Clear Accounts Payable Checks, and Clear Payroll Checks. </P>
 <P>This build corrects 'required field not filled in' error when hitting Go from the checklist screen.  This error dates from version 7.1.461.129. </P>
 <H2>5.3 Start Create EOM Unvouchered AP GL: </H2>
 <P>Corrects problem on Detail report where the largest date rather than the receipt date was appearing.</P>
 <H2>5.4 Bank Deposit Journal</H2>
 <P>Validations now prevent the sweep account from being changed in existing entries, and in new entries where lines have been added via Autoload button or on the Other tab.</P>
 <P>Validations have been added to prevent changes to entries recorded in the Bank Reconciliation Journal. Deposits must first be un-reconciled before Bank Deposit changes can be made. </P>
 <P>Enhanced validation now prevents the simultaneous use of the Cash Receipts and Bank Deposit journals from resulting in inappropriate changes being made. The user may be asked to refresh a screen or restart a transaction if needed. </P>
 <P>The Description field from Other tab lines now writes to GL history.</P>
 <P>Corrects spurious error &quot;receipt is already recorded as deposit in journal entry that occurred if you cleared and rechecked a deposit that was eligible for a previously recorded entry. </P>
 <H2>5.5 GL Report Writer</H2>
 <P>In previous releases, in a GL Report Row Layout definition, a DefineTot row defines a total account whose sign depends on whether the computed total is a net Debit or a net Credit. Net Debits generate a positive total and net Credits generate a negative total. This is regardless of the value of the Sign Control field on the DefineTot row. This results, for example, in a net Income total always generating a negative total. This can lead to percentages of net income showing up with an improper sign.</P>
 <P>This release implements the Sign Control field on the DefineTot row so that the report writer can define whether the computed total should be considered a normally Debit or a normally Credit account.</P>
 <H2>5.6 Bank Reconciliation Journal</H2>
 <P>This version prevents the user from changing previously 'finalized' Bank Reconciliation Journal transactions.&nbsp; A transaction becomes 'finalized' as soon as a newer Reconciliation transaction is recorded for the same Bank Account. When the user accesses a finalized transaction, the user is informed that the transaction cannot be changed. The Change button in a finalized transaction is disabled.</P>
 <P>The AP Journal post to the Check table now writes a negative amount for ‘credit’ EFT and Credit card transactions.  This results in these transactions being correctly displayed in the Bank Rec journal. Historical data should be adjusted via SQL; see your support rep for details.</P>
 <H1>6. Job Costing</H1>
 <H2>6.0  Unit Cost Field Size – PO, IRJ, AP to JCH</H2>
 <P>Computations of extended cost for unit costs exceeding 1,000,000 have been corrected. Note that if the quantity x unit cost exceeds the maximum extended cost value (99,999,999.99), the extended cost field is blanked. </P>
 <H2>6.1 Project Manager Viewer</H2>
 <P>In previous releases the list of Project Managers was controlled only by the Project Manager filter in the User record. The ranges now work correctly; you may filter on the Project Managers allowed by your User record. </P>
 <P>Corrects a display issue for Credit PO’s on the Purchases tab. The quantity and amount now display as negative, not positive.&nbsp;</P>
 <P><FONT style="font-weight:bold; " >New Sidebar Button</FONT></P>
 <P><IMG src="images/createpo.gif" border="0" height="28" width="48" alt="images\createpo.gif">  Click this button to launch the Purchase Order viewer to create a PO for the selected Job.  The Job Id in the new PO will be completed for you.  </P>
 <H2>6.2 Job Viewer  </H2>
 <P>Previously, the Edit Equipment button brought up a list of ALL equipment associated with the Job's Site. It is now filtered to only display active equipment. Note that inactive equipment can be accessed by clicking the Equipment list’s Filter Records button, and clearing the Inactive range. </P>
 <P><FONT style="font-weight:bold; " >Tax Fields</FONT><FONT style="font-weight:bold; " >:</FONT> If the Job Tax Status buttons or the Tax Group Tax fields are changed,  when the Save button is pressed the system now reviews Job History lines and set all lines for this job that do NOT have an AR Invoice ID or are of Tax Type Use to ' n/a' (space n/a) so that they will be successfully re-evaluated at invoice time. </P>
 <P><FONT style="font-weight:bold; " >Invoice Tab and </FONT><FONT style="font-weight:bold; " >COD Jobs:</FONT> <BR>In previous releases, the Job Invoice tab does not show COD Invoices as received due to posting issues from AR Sales Journal to JCH. This release corrects this problem and also includes minor changes to the Job Invoice reverse. An SQL to fix the failed posting retroactively is available – contact your support rep for details.  </P>
 <P><FONT style="font-weight:bold; " >Revenues Tab:</FONT> <BR>The title of the Total Revenue Column now includes the Currency Id specified in the Job's Client record.&nbsp; When the Client uses a foreign currency, the title now contains 'TotalRev (currency abbreviation)'.</P>

You may double-click on a Billing Item line to launch the Job Billing Item viewer for that record. The Budget Cost, Projected Cost and Budget Revenue are also shown on this tab.</P>
 <P><FONT style="font-weight:bold; " >Job Cloning:</FONT> When the &quot;SecurityOverrideFrom=job&quot; is present in sys-ffv-global-settings, the cloning process now retains the security values from the source records.&nbsp; For example, the security of the new job should be set from the template job's security.&nbsp; This includes other job-based data such as the cost codes, billing items and any job child records.&nbsp; In a similar way the source client site's security is used in the new site record(s) and the source client's security is used in the client record(s).</P>
 <H3>6.2.1  'Unknown' Tax Status</H3>
 <P>This enhancement addresses the situation where the tax status of a job cannot be initially determined.</P>
 <P style="margin-left:36.00pt;"><FONT style="font-weight:bold; " >Job Record</FONT><FONT style="font-weight:bold; " >: </FONT></P>
 <P style="margin-left:36.00pt;">A fourth option, Unknown, has been added to the Job Tax Status field.&nbsp; </P>
 <P style="margin-left:36.00pt;">The Tax Type Id will be set to unknown (' n/a') for jobs with an unknown tax status and is designed for those cases where it cannot be determined if a job should be set to a status of Sales or Exempt. Once the status of the Job has been changed from Unknown to Sales or Exempt, Job and Service Invoicing can be run, and will successfully evaluate the tax (or exempt amounts) for the invoice. </P>
 <P style="margin-left:36.00pt;">Validation logic regarding manual edits of line-item Tax Type Ids has been added. Changes at the line-item level are not permitted for jobs with an unknown tax status.</P>
 <P style="margin-left:72.00pt;">When job tax is 'sales', valid types are 'sales' 'n/a' 'prepaid'<BR>When job tax is 'exempt', valid types are 'exempt' 'n/a' 'prepaid'<BR>When job tax is 'use', valid types are 'use' 'n/a' 'prepaid'</P>
 <P style="margin-left:36.00pt;">Note that the system may default in a tax type of ‘mixed’ but the user is not allowed to select this type. Note that the system would generate the ‘mixed’ type if, for example, a sales tax group was comprised of two authorities, one of whom taxed Other item, and one of whom did not. </P>

 <H3>6.2.2 Validations to Client Id in Job</H3>
 <P>In this release, if Retainage has been billed the Client Id cannot be changed.&nbsp; This validation can be changed from an error to a warning  with the registry setting in user note 2.29.2. </P>
 <P>The AR Cash Receipts Journal now allows the header and line Client Ids to be different.&nbsp; This allows cash receipts to be recorded for the client that received the invoice.&nbsp; Previously, the AR Cash Receipts Journal Entries couldn't be recorded without switching the Job Client Id back to match the original invoice.</P>
 <P>The Job Invoice Reverse function now posts the reversing Sales Journal entry using the Client Id from the original invoice instead of the Job Client Id.&nbsp; </P>
 <H2>6.3 Job Cost Code Viewer</H2>
 <P>In previous releases, the user was prevented from changing the Job Id if references to the Code Code were found in Job History. Unfortunately, this validation also prevented the user from being able to ‘clone’ cost codes or billing items by accessing a job cost code, and then changing the Job Id (to a job that did not have a corresponding cost code). This implementation has been changed so that, if the user does so, the viewer will change to ‘add’ mode to allow the new record to be created. </P>
 <H2>6.4 Job Billing Item Viewer </H2>
 <P>In previous releases, the user was prevented from changing the Job Id if references to the Billing Item were found in Job History. Unfortunately, this validation also prevented the user from being able to ‘clone’ billing items by accessing a billing item, and then changing the Job Id (to a job that did not have a corresponding billing item item). This implementation has been changed so that, if the user does so, the viewer will change to ‘add’ mode to allow the new record to be created. </P>
 <H2>6.5  Start Job Cost Allocation</H2>
 <P>A new range, Tax Group Id, has been added to Start Job Cost Allocation function. When completed, this range limits the range of eligible jobs to those where the Tax Group Id (in the Job record) matches the Tax Group Id(s) specified in the Tax Group range. </P>
 <H2>6.6 Start Job End of Month Processing</H2>
 <P>The Job Cost EOM Processing function supports a new methodology for recognizing revenue for fixed fee billing items using the reported percent complete data recorded in the Job Progress Viewer to determine over/under billings.&nbsp;See user note 2.32 fo details.  In this new methodology the evaluation for eligible EOM processing is not restricted by the Amount Remaining being zero.</P>
 <P>GL Account from Vendor: this enhancement effects customers that use Job Cost Categories with no GL expense account so the gl account will pull from the Vendor. Previously, this setup worked properly for AP entries but not Job Cost EOM - which did not pull a gl account from the Vendor. This functionality has now been changed so that the GL Account in the Vendor is also considered.</P>
 <P style="margin-left:36.00pt;">Note that Inventory is a special case where the Expense Acct might come from the Inventory Group depending on registry settings and other conditions.&nbsp; Otherwise, the normal progression for all cost types is (1) Cost Category; (2) Cost Code: (3) 'glcos' registry setting; (4) the Vendor record; (5) nothing.</P>
 <P>This release corrects a problem with unreliable results when the Job EOM process was run multiple times in a single accounting period. </P>
 <P>This release also addresses the following specific set of circumstances:</P>
 <P style="margin-left:36.00pt;">1. Run Job Cost EOM for a T&amp;M work order that hasn't been billed.<BR>2. Invoice the work order in the same period as the Job Cost EOM processed.<BR>3. Re-run the Job Cost EOM so it can undo the entries made in #1 above.</P>
 <P style="margin-left:36.00pt;">Prior to this fix there was a problem in step #3: the software thought there wasn't any work to do and so it would not undo the step #1 entries. Step #3 now works properly to undo the entries made in step #1(they will appear in the checklist with a negative value).</P>
 <P>The Job Cost EOM has also been enhanced to recognize the there might be a GL Income Account in the Cost Category and includes it in the computations. </P>
 <P>Prior to this release, the billing item's Fixed Fee flag was the only consideration.&nbsp; The new code also checks the job's Service Compute flag.&nbsp; All billing items attached to service compute jobs are now treated as T&amp;M, regardless of the Fixed Fee flag setting.</P>
 <P>Validation has been added to this function that will prevent Jobs with missing GL information from being posted. If you attempt to select or click the Go button if this situation exists, the system will display the error “Job (Job Id) has detail lines that are missing GL Accounts” and will not allow the post to proceed with the illegible lines flagged. </P>
 <P>&nbsp;<FONT style="font-weight:bold; " >Hint:</FONT> The sys-job-eom registry entry or the cost category should be examined if this message is displayed. </P>
 <H2>6.7 Job Journal</H2>
 <P>The system now disallows Inventory Items on actual entries. This validation is in place for adding new and editing existing entries. </P>
 <H2>6.8 Job Progress viewer</H2>
 <P>The Job Progress viewer now allows the user to look at progress data older than the most recent data.&nbsp; The Change button is disabled to prevent changes when reviewing the historical data. When the user accesses historical data, the system will display a message “Progress already reported through (most recent date). Additional revisions dated (historical date) not permitted.”</P>
 <P><FONT style="font-weight:bold; " >New Field: Reported Thru</FONT><BR>The Job Progress parent form already included an effective date field that was used during the posting of the progress updates to JCH.&nbsp; Changes to this viewer include: </P>
 <P>1. The parent form now shows the latest 'progress' effective date in the JCH as the Reported Date.<BR>2. The child lines are now computed when the user enters an Effective Date.<BR>3. The 'new' Effective Date cannot precede the Reported Date (if it has been set).</P>
 <H1>7 Inventory</H1>
 <H2>7.1 Inventory Item</H2>
 <P>This release<FONT style="font-weight:bold; " > </FONT>corrects the setting of inventory last cost if a user deletes a PO line or changed the item id on the line. If the deleted/changed line had set the last cost, the last cost will now revert to its previous value. </P>
 <P>The software now excludes AP Journal edits to items bought to wo's / jobs from the average cost calculation. </P>
 <P>In previous releases, the Inventory Item did not respond to the registry setting that designated the inventory item (and its assorted child tables) as Security Exceptions so that all users with access to inventory items could create and edit inventory items. This restriction has been eliminated in this version. </P>
 <P>This release includes a performance enhancement when accessing inventory items with significant history.  </P>
 <P>When an inventory item is ‘cloned’ (using an existing record to create a new one), the Last Cost is now cleared when the new record is created. Note that if the Standard Cost is set in the new record, the last cost field will default from it (this is the desired behavior). </P>

 <P>The system now checks if the serialized item is actually on-hand at the From location when moving from a location to a Job or Location. It does not test for its presence in the To Job or the From Job. In addition, validation has been added to prevent the use from the user from transferring more than 1 of a serial number from a job into a location. The system does not allow the adjustment if the serialized item is already on hand at a location. </P>
 <H2>7.8  Start Rebuild Inventory Cost Table</H2>
 <P>This new starter function creates and fills a new table 'Item_Costs_By_Lctn' (dropping a pre-existing table if one exists). When this function is run, it will create a snapshot of inventory costs at each location at that moment in time that may be used for reporting purposes. Note that although the table will exist in your database, a View is not available in SAM Pro.</P>
 <P>If your firm has a significant amount of inventory history, you may wish to run this function after hours.  Reports that access this table should be run as soon as possible after the function is run. This table will contain the following columns evaluated for each combination of item and location in the invntryitmlctn table:</P>
 <P>&nbsp; &nbsp; invntryitm_rn<BR>&nbsp; &nbsp; lctn_rn<BR>&nbsp; &nbsp; qntty_on_hnd<BR>&nbsp; &nbsp; avrge_cst<BR>&nbsp; &nbsp; lst_cst</P>

 <H1>8 Payroll</H1>
 <H2>8.1 Labor Journal</H2>
 <P><FONT style="font-weight:bold; " >Payroll Period Id:<BR></FONT>The user is now prevented from selecting an active Payroll Period with a closed Accounting Period. In addition, the code for defaulting the Payroll Period in this journal now requires an active Accounting Period.</P>
 <P><FONT style="font-weight:bold; " >Compute Labor Hours</FONT> (start and end times in custom views only): <BR>Corrects error that occurred  if a very small time period was entered (e.g., set the End Time equal to the Start Time plus one minute). </P>
 <H2>8.2 Start Compute Payroll </H2>
 <P>This release corrects a sporadic problem in allocating the job cost amount of fringes (marked as Job Cost PR Checks) for labor journal entries that included a pay rate factor greater than one.  </P>
 <P>Canadian Vacation Pay requires a pay rate that consists of two Earnings lines: one for the hourly base pay rate and one for the percentage added to the pay rate for Canadian Vacation Pay.&nbsp; SAMPRO was already capable of computing the correct wages for this setup but it didn't properly handle the posting to GL when the two Earnings lines referenced different GL Accounts. This has been corrected. </P>
 <P>The computations that reduce taxable pay for a given tables Standard Deduction Percentage were calculating the standard deduction to be too low. This problem has been corrected.</P>
 <H3>8.2.1 PR Deduction Disposable Income Limits (for Garnishments)</H3>
 <P>This enhancement is about supporting a combination of disposable income limitations (the maximum percentage allowed for all such deductions) and the traditional SAMPRO deduction limit.&nbsp; Previously, the presence of the 'disposable income'-type limitation (accessed by clicking the Magnify button on the employee’s Deduction tab) would override the other (traditional) deduction limitation.</P>
 <P>Consider this example ... a judgment is issued that says 10% of disposable income should be garnished from each pay with an annual limit of $2,500. This case, Limit would be set to $2,500, Deduction Limit Type to percent, Amount to 10.0, and Disposable Limit to 10.</P>
 <P>If an employee has $1,000 of disposable income per week would generate a $100 deduction per week.&nbsp; After 25 weeks, the full annual amount of $2,500 has been deducted.&nbsp; The Employee Deduction line appeared to support this setup however, prior to this enhancement, there was no way to prevent the $100 deduction from being taken in the 26th week.&nbsp; That was due to the Compute PR treating the disposable income limitation as an override to the Employee Deduction line's Limit and Limit Type selections. The system now looks at both the Limit and the Disposable Limit when Compute is run. In the above example, the garnishment would not be taken in the 26<FONT style="vertical-align:super; " >th</FONT> week when using this release. </P>
 <P>In addition, the system now validates &amp; enforces that the Limit Value must be 0, when Limit Amount Type = &quot;n/a&quot;.</P>
 <P>Important Note: the Deduction Amount Type of ‘Standard’ is reserved for future use, and should NOT be selected. </P>
 <H2>8.3 Report Payroll Check</H2>
 <P>This build corrects problems in recent 7.1 builds:</P>
 <P style="margin-left:36.00pt;">If 4 or more PTO Pay types are accrued, the first two are once again listed individually, and the remaining types are combined under the heading ‘various.’  </P>
 <P style="margin-left:36.00pt;">PTO Pay types that are NOT accrued will not appear on the PTO Summary.  Holiday hours (for example) were being incorrectly included in the PTO summary as negative hours. </P>
 <P>Corrects display of extraneous % signs for % type fringes on P/R Check Stubs.</P>
 <P><FONT style="font-weight:bold; " >PR Checks</FONT><FONT style="font-weight:bold; " > in a Multi-User Environment</FONT><FONT style="font-weight:bold; " >:</FONT> <BR>New functionality prevents users from doing multiple simultaneous check runs for the same GL / Entity combination.  Compute Payroll now ignores employees with in-use PR data (if a PR Check is being run for that Employee, they will be skipped by Compute PR).</P>
 <H2>8.4 Enhanced Prevailing Wage Functionality</H2>
 <H3>8.4.1 Job Viewer</H3>
 <P><FONT style="font-weight:bold; " >Financial Tab - New Field:</FONT></P>
 <P><FONT style="font-weight:bold; " >Prevailing Wage: </FONT><FONT style="font-weight:bold; " >  </FONT><FONT style="font-weight:bold; " >N/A     Labor Rate</FONT></P>
 <P>If N/A is selected, either this job does not user Prevailing Wages, or uses the Employee Overrides tab to implement this functionality. The following validation rules have been added to the Job Viewer added for this field and the new 'Prevailing Wages' tab:</P>
 <P style="margin-left:36.00pt;">1. Deny all data entry on the Prevailing Wages tab when the Job's Prevailing Wage Type is 'N/A'.<BR>2. Deny entry changes to the Job's Prevailing Wage Type field when the Prevailing Wages child tab is not empty.</P>
 <P style="margin-left:36.00pt;"><FONT style="font-weight:bold; " >Tip:</FONT> If this is to be a Labor Rate Prevailing Wage Job, select Labor Rate, and save the record before attempting to add any lines to the Prevailing Wage tab. </P>
 <H3>8.4.2  Changed Tab: Was ‘Prevailing Wages’, Is ‘Employee Overrides’</H3>
 <H3>New Tab: Prevailing Wages:</H3>
 <P>In previous releases, prevailing wage type jobs have been handled on an employee by employee basis by specifying overrides on the Job’s old Prevailing Wages tab. This tab provided overrides for time entered on this job in the Labor Journal, Remote Labor Journal, and Work Order Labor screen. This release corrects a problem where prevailing wage job costs with fringes were not calculated correctly. </P>
 <P>Although the earlier functionality is still supported (with the tab renamed ‘Employee Overrides’), new functionality has been implemented via a NEW Prevailing Wages tab which allows you to specify the Prevailing ‘package’ rate by Labor Rate. </P>
 <P>When the Employee’s Labor rate matches one on the Job’s Prevailing Wage tab, the system compares the Package amount with the Employee’s wages + fringe total when hours are entered in the Work Order Labor Tab, Labor Journal and Remote Labor time entry (including TechAnywhere).   If the Employee’s wages + fringes exceed the Package amount, the Employee’s Wages will be used for the Wage calculation. </P>
 <P>Take the case of an Employee pay package (base wage plus fringes): on any given labor line, the line's package has three potential sources ... </P>
 <P style="margin-left:36.00pt;">1. Defaulted from Employee record (Earnings tab or Earnings Group)</P>
 <P style="margin-left:36.00pt;">2. Defaulted from Job's Employee Overrides</P>
 <P style="margin-left:36.00pt;">3. User typed it </P>
 <P>The prevailing wage calculations do not care about the source ... only that there is an Employee pay package to compare against a Job’s Prevailing Wage Package for a common Labor Rate Id.  </P>
 <P><FONT style="font-weight:bold; " >Start:&nbsp;Date:<BR></FONT>These fields default the effective (work) date range the prevailing wage is in effect for.</P>
 <P><FONT style="font-weight:bold; " >Labor Rate Id:<BR></FONT>All Labor Rates that would be impacted by this job’s prevailing wage functionality should be listed on this tab.</P>
 <P><FONT style="font-weight:bold; " >Package:<BR></FONT>The package amount (wages + fringes) of the prevailing wage job for this Labor Id. </P>
 <P style="margin-left:36.00pt;"><FONT style="text-decoration:underline;" >Example 1: Employee’s Regular Wages + Fringes Exceed Job Package Amount</FONT></P>
 <P style="margin-left:36.00pt;">Package Amount: $25.00 / hour</P>
 <P style="margin-left:36.00pt;">Wage Earnings: $24.00 / hour</P>
 <P style="margin-left:36.00pt;">Fringe 1: $2.50 / hour</P>
 <P style="margin-left:36.00pt;">Fringe 2: $1.50 / hour</P>
 <P style="margin-left:36.00pt;">Since the Employee’s regular Wages + Fringes total $28.00 / hours, they will be used for payroll calculations for this Previewing Wage job.</P>
 <P style="margin-left:36.00pt;"><FONT style="text-decoration:underline;" >Example 2: Job Package Amount Exceeds Employee’s Regular Wages + Fringes </FONT></P>
 <P style="margin-left:36.00pt;">Package Amount: $30.00 / hour</P>
 <P style="margin-left:36.00pt;">Wage Earnings: $24.00 / hour</P>
 <P style="margin-left:36.00pt;">Fringe 1: $2.50 / hour</P>
 <P style="margin-left:36.00pt;">Fringe 2: $1.50 / hour</P>
 <P style="margin-left:36.00pt;">Since the Employee’s regular Wages + Fringes total $28.00 / hours, the Prevailing Wage methodology will come into effect. The system calculates the Employee’s Wages as follows:</P>
 <P style="margin-left:36.00pt;">Wage Earnings Calculated Under Prevailing Wage: $26.00 / hour</P>
 <P style="margin-left:36.00pt;">Fringe 1: $2.50 / hour</P>
 <P style="margin-left:36.00pt;">Fringe 2: $1.50 / hour</P>
 <P style="margin-left:36.00pt;">Note that the Employee’s Wages + Fringes package now equals $30 / hours, the Prevailing Wage Job Package rate. The increased difference is added to the Employee wage. </P>
 <H2>8.5 Report W-2</H2>
 <P>Corrects ‘key not found’ error when printing W-2’s.&nbsp;</P>
 <H3>8.5.1 Added support for 4-up forms</H3>

 <P style="margin-left:36.00pt;"><FONT style="font-weight:bold; " >Limitations of the BC2 4-Up Functionality</FONT><FONT style="font-weight:bold; " ><BR></FONT>This functionality was originally designed for those cases where no more than one state plus one local authority (or 2 local authorities or 2 states) would ever be printed for a single employee’s W2.

 <P>This function skips inventory UNLESS a Vendor Id has been specified.&nbsp; This provides a means of creating POs for special order/pricing inventory. Note that the Start Material Requisitioning function must be used to generate Stock Transfer Orders for an Inventory Line that does not specify a Vendor. </P>

If errors exist, nothing will be imported. </P>
 <P>Pushing the import button presents a form prompting the user for Date Required, Cost Category Id and Hold (yes/no).&nbsp; Electing to continue opens a disk browser that lets the user point to the import file.</P>

 <P>COS Posting for Use Tax Accruals: the system now makes sure that tax cost gets expensed regardless of 'txtype.id'</P>
 <P>In previous releases, you could select a serialized item from any location regardless of whether or not it was onhand at that location.

 <P>Corrects problem where Quoted lines were erroneously writing to IM history when a WO was invoiced. </P>
 <H3>9.1.2 Required Resources Tab</H3>
 <P>In previous releases, the software took WO Required Resources inventory lines and 'moved' them to the WO Inventory child table.&nbsp; This has been changed so that these lines are aggregated into a single Shop Transfer Order.&nbsp;See section 12 of these user notes for details. </P>
 <P><FONT style="font-weight:bold; " >New Field: Date Required&nbsp;<BR></FONT>This field is required. It will be used by the system to generate the Shop and or Purchase Orders needed to fill the requirement. </P>
 <P>If a Flat Rate is imported (with Required Resource processing enabled), the Date on the Flat Import window will be used to set the Date Required on the Required Resource tab. If an inventory item is on the flat rate, the Description is now set from the Inventory Item Name.&nbsp;</P>
 <P><FONT style="font-weight:bold; " >New Fields: </FONT><FONT style="font-weight:bold; " >Qty Avail:  Qty On-Hand:<BR></FONT>These display-only fields are calculated by the system based on the following criteria:</P>

 <H3>9.1.3 Revenue Tab  </H3>
 <P>This release corrects an alignment issue on Actual Qty and Total Cost columns.</P>
 <H3>9.1.4 Warn user if WO is assigned to a TechAnywhere or SubAnywhere Tech</H3>
 <P>When a record is loaded into the Work Order viewer, the software will check if any uncompleted Technician lines are assigned to a TechAnywhere or SubAnywhere technician. Specifically, it will check the log type = 'Unacknowledged', 'OnSite', 'Travel', 'On Break', 'Waiting Parts', 'Parts Ordered', 'Scheduled', 'Waiting Service' and 'Quote Approved'. Technicians include only those techs marked as either &quot;Technician using CE or XP&quot; or &quot;Subcontractor using the Web&quot;. </P>
 <P>If the above criteria are met, the system will display a message that “WARNING: this work order has open assignments to remote technicians”.</P>
 <H3>9.1.5 Technician Tab</H3>
 <P>A new log type status, Checked Out, has been added to be used in with SubAnywhere.  </P>
 <P>In addition, the Rescheduled log type and escalation status have been added. This status falls between Scheduled and Waiting Service in priority. The wo escalation status of Rescheduled has an escalation status category of Open. Tech Declined has been added as an escalation status. </P>
 <H3>9.1.6 Gross Margin Tab</H3>
 <P>A new column, Gross Margin Dollars (GM$) has been added to the Gross Margin tab of the Work Order. This column is calculated by subtracting the Billable Cost from the Revenue. </P>
 <H3>9.1.7 Sales Tax Tab</H3>
 <P>In this release,<FONT style="font-weight:bold; " > </FONT>‘no tax’ labor entries are now written to the sales tax tab. Although no tax was being reported, these entries were needed in order to write to the Tax History table correctly. </P>
 <P>The Compute Taxes button and Start Service Compute now take into account the Tax Type Id of the work order line. </P>
 <H3>9.1.8 Work Order Labor Tab</H3>
 <P>If a default period does not exist for the WO's security setting, the system will now default in the default global pay period (if present). </P>
 <P><FONT style="font-weight:bold; " >Compute Labor Hours</FONT> (start and end times in custom views only): corrects error that occurred  if a very small time period was entered (e.g., set the End Time equal to the Start Time plus one minute). </P>
 <H3>9.1.9 Work Order Other Tab </H3>
 <P>Corrects problem where the system was allowing changes to be made to the Description field of invoiced Work Order Other lines, despite a validation message to the contrary. </P>
 <H3>9.1.10 Work Order Inventory Tab</H3>
 <P>When importing a Flat Rate, the GL Entity for Inventory lines is now set according to the standard criteria: First from Job Cost Code (if set), next from the Location (if set), and last from the Inventory Group.</P>
 <P>When importing Flat Rate Inventory to Work Order that points to a Use Tax job, the Tax Type is now set to Use and the Tax Cost is computed. </P>
 <H3>9.1.11 Work Order Invoicing Tab</H3>
 <P><IMG src="images/resettaxjch.gif" align=left border=0 height=17 width=95 alt="images\resettaxjch.gif"> A new  button has been added to the Invoicing Tab: &quot;Reset Tax Type JCH&quot;.&nbsp; Pressing this button reviews Job History lines and set all lines for this work order that do NOT have an AR Invoice ID or are of Tax Type Use to ' n/a'  (space n/a) so that they will be successfully re-evaluated at invoice time if the Job’s Tax Status or Tax Group has been changed. This button also changes all applicable lines within the Work Order viewer itself to a tax type of ' n/a'.</P>
 <H3>9.1.12 WO Escalation Tab</H3>
 <P>The Escalation Tab provides a synopsis of the Scheduled Events associate with this Work Order. You may click on a column heading to sort the information by this column in ascending order. Clicking on the column again will sort in descending order.</P>
 <H2>9.2 New Call</H2>
 <P>Corrects “error 102 – incorrect syntax” if the Site Name (or other search fields) included a single quote in New Call 2.</P>
 <P><FONT style="font-weight:bold; " >Background Documentation:</FONT></P>
 <P>When a Site is selected in New Call, the system attempts to determine which Client it is associated with in order to check the AR Balance and Aging either of the client or of a specific site associated with the client (if the registry option EnableNewCallClientSiteARAnalysis=true is enabled). The following is done to derive the Client:</P>
 <P style="margin-left:36.00pt;">1. First, look at the Default Service Job in the Equipment record for that Site that has the lowest Rn (generally, the first Equipment that was created for the Site). If the Job is specified, check its Client.</P>
 <P style="margin-left:36.00pt;">2. If the Equipment record with the lowest Rn has no Default Service Job, the system will check the Client Site record’s Client field (on the COP tab), and use that Client for the AR analysis.</P>
 <P style="margin-left:36.00pt;">3. If the system cannot derive the Client using either of the above methods, AR / Credit Checking will be postponed until a piece of Equipment is selected. The system will then check that piece of Equipment’s default Service Job to derive the Client.</P>
 <P style="margin-left:36.00pt;">4. If the selected Equipment has no Default Service Job, Credit / AR Balance checking will finally be initiated when the user selects a Job in New Call. </P>
 <P><FONT style="font-weight:bold; " >Service Manager Defaulting</FONT><FONT style="font-weight:bold; " >:</FONT></P>
 <P style="margin-left:36.00pt;">Previously, the Service Manager that was actually assigned to the work order was based on the User creating the new Work Order or the Manager in the Site record (via the registry setting in sys-newcall for 'ServiceManagerBasedOnSite=true'). The software has been re-coded so that the value the user sees default in is based on these rules:</P>
 <P style="margin-left:36.00pt;">&nbsp;a. The Service Manager in the Equipment record rules on the defaulting.&nbsp; If it has one, use it.<BR>&nbsp;b. Next, apply the ServiceManagerBasedOnSite option if it is implemented in the registry.<BR>&nbsp;c. When all else fails, use the AFO concept that the User Account defines the choice.</P>
 <P style="margin-left:36.00pt;">When the new Work Order is generated, the software now uses the value that appears on the New Call screen (whether defaulted by the software or entered by the user). </P>
 <P><FONT style="font-weight:bold; " >New Functionality in Credit Hold Processing:</FONT> </P>
 <P style="margin-left:36.00pt;">If the Site that the user selects is on Credit Hold, the user will now be warned, and the work order will be placed on credit hold. This processing was already implemented for the Client being on Credit Hold. This build corrects problems in AR and Credit Hold message caching, and ensures that the AR Client is correctly determined when the Equipment was selected.  </P>
 <P style="margin-left:36.00pt;">If the AR Balance exceeds the Client’s Credit Limit, the user will also be warned and the work order will be placed on credit hold. The following registry entry may be used to disable the AR Balance/Credit Limit functionality that sets the WO on credit hold:  Id: sys-newcall  Contents:  DisableClientCreditLimit=true</P>
 <P>The system once again uses phone icon for New Call window.</P>
 <P>This build corrects Call Script functionality to order questions to match lines in Call Script viewer.</P>
 <P>Corrects a sporadic problem involving the sys-newcall registry setting 'SkipSiteListOnLoad'.</P>
 <P>Corrects an auto-loading problem where manually entered Dispatcher, Service Manager,  or Sales Rep Id’s were overridden from the Site or Equipment record when the screen was refreshed after, for example, a Call Script being displayed.</P>
 <P>Call sequencing is now disabled when no tech has been assigned when a work order is created in New Call. This is to prevent an overflow error that could occur if 999 or more unassigned pm’s were created, and then a new assigned work order was generated in New Call, when previously forced the sequencing. </P>
 <P>If a User selects a Site whose status is set to Credit Hold, they will be alerted, and the WO will be marked as on Credit Hold.</P>
 <P>This release corrects problem that only occurred if the site equipment lacked default job, cost code and billing items. If you selected the site and then entered the job and cost code before selecting the equipment, the default billing item (from the cost code) did NOT default in.   </P>
 <P><IMG src="images/rr_on.gif" border=0 height=28 width=48 alt="images\rr_on.gif"> Required Resources / Materials Requisition: if this module is enabled in your system, you may enter required resources to a work order from New Call. See section 12.7 of these user notes for details. </P>
 <P>Corrects problem where mouse clicks on the Documents list (to select a document) were being ignored.</P>
 <H3>9.2.1 Branch Processing in New Call</H3>
 <P>Branch Processing has been revised in New Call so that it now works as follows:</P>
 <P>1. When a Site is selected, all Branch info (Id, Rn, Name, etc) is set based on the Site's branch.</P>
 <P>2. When Equipment is selected, all Branch info is set based on the associated Job's branch unless any one of the following is true:</P>
 <P style="text-indent:30.25pt;">- the Job does not have a Branch specified</P>
 <P style="text-indent:30.25pt;">- the registry setting UseSiteBranch=true is set in sys-newcall </P>
 <P style="text-indent:30.25pt;">- the registry setting BranchOverrideFrom=clntste is set in sys-ffv-global-settings</P>
 <P>The Branch assigned to the newly created work order should match what the user sees on the New Call entry form.</P>
 <P>Note that if BranchOverrideFrom=job is set in sys-ffv-global-settings, the Job’s Branch is always used, and there is no fallback to the Branch in the User’s account. </P>
 <P>If the above registry overrides are not present, the Branch from the User’s account will default if the Site and Job do not specify a Branch. In this case, the User may change or clear the Branch Id as allowed by his branch filtering/security. </P>
 <H3>9.2.1 New Call 2 New COD Site</H3>
 <P>The system now refreshes the screen back to NewCall2 when the COD WO has been created / printed.</P>
 <P>The Date Opened in the Site record is now set to today’s date when a COD site is created.</P>
 <P>The screen is now correctly refreshed when the template Equipment is selected. </P>
 <P><FONT style="font-weight:bold; " >   </FONT><FONT style="font-weight:bold; " >New Field - </FONT><FONT style="font-weight:bold; " > Zip Branch </FONT><FONT style="font-weight:bold; " >Id:</FONT> </P>
 <P>If Branch Id’s are included in your Zip Code records, this field will be displayed when the dispatcher enters the zip code. It is designed to assist the dispatcher in selecting the correct, branch-specific client site template for the new COD customer. &nbsp;</P>
 <P><FONT style="font-weight:bold; " >New Field: Dispatch Note<BR></FONT>When completed, this field will be written to the new Client Site’s Dispatch Note field. This optional field is designed to provide useful information (e.g., Guard Dog, Call Owner, etc.) to the Dispatcher/Technician.  An updated v.cus file is required to see this enhancement. </P>
 <P><FONT style="font-weight:bold; " >New COD:</FONT> </P>
 <P>The Tax Group ID / Service Zone now refreshes when the user changes the Zip code (assuming that the Tax Group Id and Service Zone are specified in the Zip Code record). </P>
 <P><FONT style="font-weight:bold; " >New Call 2 / COD Site Users</FONT><FONT style="font-weight:bold; " > – Template Records</FONT><FONT style="font-weight:bold; " >:<BR></FONT>When New Call 2/ COD Site was first Implemented, all new COD Sites were created with their equipment pointing at a COD Template Job. In actual practice, it turns out that when a Template Job is referenced in a work order, changing it (e.g., for warranty work) generated template warning messages that interfere with work flow. For this reason, you may wish to create your COD Jobs be created as regular Jobs, not Templates. </P>
 <P><FONT style="font-weight:bold; " >Template Records:</FONT> This case fixes template record error messages so that the true status of the record is listed. </P>
 <H2>9.3 Master Contract</H2>
 <P><FONT style="font-weight:bold; " >Master Contract Billing Tab</FONT></P>
 <P>The GL Debit account on the Master Contract Advanced Billing tab was previously only displayed on the detail view accessed by clicking the Magnify button. This field has been added to the front screen of the tab below the Credit Account. </P>
 <P style="margin-left:36.00pt;"><FONT style="font-weight:bold; " >DB </FONT><FONT style="font-weight:bold; " >GL Account:<BR></FONT>The<FONT style="font-weight:bold; " > </FONT>Liability (unearned income) account where the Amount Billed will post.  This Account will be debited with the Amount Billed when PM invoices are generated, printed, and posted. If you are amortizing, both accounts are required on each line.  Also note, amortized amounts will post with the ending date of the corresponding accounting period. </P>
 <H2>9.4 Dispatch Board </H2>
 <P>Corrects in problem in recent builds where, if the user attempted to access a WO when the WO list was already displayed, the WO highlighted on the list would be accessed, not the one selected on the Dispatch board. A similar problem accessing PO’s from the WO Purchases tab is also corrected.  </P>
 <P>This build corrects sporadic errors that occurred if the user clicked on out of range (blank) areas of the board. </P>
 <P>When the dispatch board registry is set to: SaveRanges=true and PreferencesByBoard=yes, the Log Type Id range values are now correctly updated when the board is switched. </P>
 <P>The Classic/Day Board row/column titles are now properly refreshed when Date Scheduled is changed; this problem occurred due to the performance enhancements made to earlier versions of the software.</P>
 <P style="margin-left:36.00pt;"><FONT style="font-weight:bold; " >Important Note Registry Entries for Classic and Day Boards:</FONT></P>
 <P style="margin-left:36.00pt;">The Classic / Day Board performance enhancements seem to have changed the way in which the Hours fields in the information cells are refreshed. The Hours field is a 7 character field, and is now displayed as left justified. This means that if the Classic or Day boards are configured via a custom registry setting, and the Hours field is specified as less than 7 characters, all of the digits will not display (for example, 12.50 will appear as 12. if 5 characters are specified via registry). </P>
 <P>Performance enhancements have been made which should increase the speed of various operations, and reduce the ‘flashing’ of the Classic board that occurred after an operation (such as drag and drop) was completed. </P>
 <P>The Release to Tech button on the side button bar now functions correctly when the Classic and Day boards are displayed. Previously, this button only functioned correctly when the Power board was displayed.</P>
 <H3>9.4.1 Auto Refresh</H3>
 <P>This functionality is useful if you are displaying the Dispatch board on VERY LARGE flat panel monitors in the dispatch room for quick and easy review by service managers, techs, and so on.&nbsp; A new AutoRefresh toggle button has been added to the Top Bar of the Dispatchboard; you must scroll down to see the button.  </P>
 <P><IMG src="images/autorefreshoff.gif" border=0 height=35 width=63 alt="images\autorefreshoff.gif"> When the Dispatchboard is opened the toggle is set to off.</P>
 <P><IMG src="images/autorefreshon.gif" border=0 height=35 width=63 alt="images\autorefreshon.gif"> Pressing the button sets the toggle on or off.</P>
 <P>When autoRefresh is on the Dispatchboard will refresh itself every timer duration (see below).</P>
 <P><FONT style="font-weight:bold; " >Setting the timer duration<BR></FONT>The default duration is 60 seconds (60000 milliseconds)<BR>This can be changed with a Registry Setting In sys-dispatchboard<BR>add 1 and only 1 of the 3 following choices:<BR><BR>timermilliseconds=(number of milliseconds)&nbsp; 1000 milliseconds = 1 second<BR>timerminutes=(number of minutes)&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; 1 minute = 60000 milliseconds<BR>timerseconds=(number of seconds)&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; 1 second = 1000 milliseconds</P>
 <H3>9.4.2 Dispatch Board Filters</H3>
 <P>In previous releases, the filter for the Account Manager and Sales Rep Id's ranges referenced the Client Site values. In this release, the system references the Id's found in the Work Order header (which default from the Site but may be changed by the user).</P>
 <H3>9.4.3 Classic Dispatch Board - Hours Board</H3>
 <P>It was possible for Wheel mouse users to click in the Technicians column (which does not have a vertical scroll bar) and then scroll only that column up. This resulted in the work orders not being in the appropriate row for the technician. In this release, SAM Pro does not allow scrolling with the mouse wheel if no vertical scroll bar is found.  To scroll the Hours board, the right-hand section must now be selected.  </P>
 <P style="margin-top:0;margin-bottom:0">&nbsp;</P>
 <H2>9.5 Create PM Work Orders </H2>
 <P><FONT style="font-weight:bold; " >Master Contracts</FONT><FONT style="font-weight:bold; " >: </FONT>Corrects a problem in correctly generating work orders where  the Master Contract has multiple lines for each inspection date (each references a different work code) and the Create function is run for a specify work code. </P>
 <P>Corrects a problem that occurred when the sys-ffv-global-settings options BranchOverrideFrom=job and BranchSequence=nextwo are enabled. When running Create PM Work Orders, the first pm work order had a branch prefix from the user account - not the job. This has been corrected. </P>
 <P>Even if the user clears the Branch Id range when running this functions, only those Branches that match his or her Branch filter (in the User record) will appear if the following registry setting is in effect:  Id: sys-ffv-global-settings   Contents: BranchFilterWithHardBlock=true.</P>
 <P>If a PO is created for a Sub-Contractor tech, the PO # is now written to that line in the Tech tab as a display-only field. </P>
 <P>In previous releases, the Service Category in the range filtered on the service category in the work code on the Client Site Equipment PM Schedule line. This has been corrected so it looks at the service category in the Client Site Equipment header.</P>
 <P>The system now treats 'Credit Hold' sites as active and allows invoices and work orders to be created for them.&nbsp; PM WOs for credit hold sites are now placed on Credit Hold and require a Credit Manager to release them. PM Work Order Invoices generated for Credit Hold sites are not placed on Credit Hold and may be billed. </P>
 <P>This also impacts the way in which Client Site Equipment PM Schedule and Client Site PM Billing lines generated from the Master Contract record are handled. In previous releases, Client Sites marked as Inactive were not excluded. In this release, Client Site Equipment PM Schedule and Client Site PM Billing lines will not be generated from the Master Contract record if the Client Site status is set to Inactive or Mail List.</P>
 <H2>9.6 Technician Record</H2>
 <P><FONT style="font-weight:bold; " >New Device Type: Web<BR></FONT>A 'Web' Remote Device Type has been added as a new option in the Technician record.&nbsp; This choice should only be available when Web Access is 'Subcontractor' and SubAnywhere is enabled.&nbsp; </P>
 <H2>9.7 Notification Categories - Emailing from SAMPRO</H2>
 <P>Corrects a problem in recent versions where the email address was not captured if the notification was to be sent to the Service Manager and the address defaulted from the Service Manager’s Contact record. </P>
 <P>Previously, if more than one email address was listed in the notification viewer To field, the event would appear on list of scheduled events, and appear to be executed, but the email was never sent out. This enhancement to our SMTP processing now handles this situation correctly; multiple addresses will be parsed and sent when the scheduled event is executed.  </P>
 <H2>9.8 Revised Service Reports to Install</H2>
 <P><FONT style="font-weight:bold; " >Service Invoice (SERVICEINVOICE.rpt), Service Worksheet (SERVICEWORKSHEET.rpt)</FONT></P>
 <P>A new Email Invoices field has been added to the Job record on the Invoicing tab. The Service Invoice and Worksheet report (as of 09-18-2008 for the invoice and 09-23-2008 for the worksheet) reports use this new job field instead of the Job Contact 1 Email field for the Auto-emailing / printing functionality. Note that during database conversion, this field will be initialized from the Job Contact 1 email field, which was previously used to support the auto-emailing functionality. </P>
 <P><FONT style="font-weight:bold; " >Service Worksheet (SERVICEWORKSHEET.rpt)</FONT></P>
 <P>This report supports the inclusion of the Hourly Burden (in the Job Cost Code) in the cost displayed on individual labor lines – although it was being picked up on the worksheets total cost summary. This discrepancy in the report has been corrected.  </P>
 <P>In addition, the Labor Burden is now also added to the total labor cost when a work order's Gross Margin is calculated in the Work Order viewer. </P>
 <P><FONT style="font-weight:bold; " >Report Service History Detail</FONT></P>
 <P>If the web user is running with the DisplayReportsAsPDF=true option enabled in web-settings, and runs a report with no contents (e.g., the service history report with no work orders within the selected date range), the system returns the HTTP 404 Page not Found message. The new version of the report (RSRVCEHSTRYDTL.rpt) – dated 9/17-2008 -  displays a ‘Data not found’ message if its contents would otherwise be empty. </P>
 <P style="margin-left:36.00pt;"><FONT style="font-weight:bold; " >Important Note:</FONT> the Calendar Code implemented as a part of case 2218 MUST BE installed or the system will display an error if this report is run. </P>
 <H2>9.9 New PM Scheduling / Billing / Master Contract Reports to Install</H2>
 <H2>9.9.1 Report PM WorkOrders </H2>
 <H3>Purpose:</H3>
 <P>In previous releases, it was very difficult to understand what PM Work Orders would be created from Master Contract until after the fact. This report is a 'predictor': it evaluate the Master Contract data and the data residing in the Client Site Equipment PM Schedule, and lists what PM Work Orders will be created when Start Create PM WorkOrders is run. This report (RPMWRKORDRLST.rpt) must be imported into your database before it can be run. </P>
 <H3>Range Screen:</H3>
 <P><FONT style="font-weight:bold; " >Beginning Date:     Ending Date:</FONT> <BR>These fields define the range of Scheduled Inspection Dates that you wish to report on. </P>
 <P><FONT style="font-weight:bold; " >Client Id:</FONT><FONT style="font-weight:bold; " > </FONT><FONT style="font-weight:bold; " > Client Site Id:   Branch Id:   Project Id:  Work Code Id:  Service Category Id:<BR></FONT>These ranges enable you to filter the report, just as you would the actual Create PM Work Order function. If you leave these fields blank, Work Orders for the specified Inspection Date(s) for all applicable clients will be within your security level will appear on your report. </P>
 <P><FONT style="font-weight:bold; " >Master Contract Id:</FONT><BR>If you wish to only report on work orders for equipment assigned to a specific Master Contract enter the desired Id.</P>
 <P><FONT style="font-weight:bold; " >WorkOrder Id:<BR></FONT>By default, this field is set to = so that only inspections that do not yet have a work order generated will appear on the report. To report on predicted work orders as well as those that have already been created, clear this field. </P>
 <H3>Report Format:</H3>
 <P>The report format mirrors the ‘checklist’ screen of the Start Create PM Work Order Function, displaying the following fields for each work order or predicted work order:</P>
 <P><FONT style="font-weight:bold; " >Site Id:&nbsp;Site Name:   &nbsp;Service Tasks Id:&nbsp;Est Hours:&nbsp;Work Order Id:<BR>&nbsp;Equipment Id:&nbsp;Inspect Date:&nbsp;Agreement #&nbsp;PM Invoice:</FONT></P>
 <P style="margin-left:36.00pt;"><FONT style="font-weight:bold; " >Important Note: Work Order Id Begins with a #</FONT><FONT style="font-weight:bold; " ><BR></FONT>If the Work Order Id begins with a #, it represents a place holder for a Master Contract PM Work Order that has not yet been generated. </P>
 <H3>Report Order:</H3>
 <P>Predicted Master Contract PM Work Orders (yet to be generated) will appear first in the report, followed by predicted PM Work Orders not associated with a Master Contract. If the Work Order Id range was cleared so that actual PM Work Orders would be included, Predicted Master Contract Work Orders will appear first, and actual and predicted PM Work Orders will appear second.</P>
 <P>Unless overridden by registry, the work orders in each section will be ordered as follows:</P>
 <P>By Client Site Id, Client Site PM Date Scheduled, Work Code Priority, Client Site Equipment Id.</P>
 <H3>9.9.2 Report PM Billing List (RPMBLLNGLST.rpt)</H3>
 <P>In previous releases, it was very difficult to understand what PM Billing Schedule would be created from Master Contract until after the fact. This report is a 'predictor': it evaluate the Master Contract data and the data residing in the Client Site Billing Schedule, and lists what Billings will be created when Start Create PM Billings is run. </P>
 <H3>Range Screen:</H3>
 <P><FONT style="font-weight:bold; " >Beginning Date:     Ending Date:</FONT> <BR>These fields define the range of Billing Dates that you wish to report on. </P>
 <P><FONT style="font-weight:bold; " >Client Id:&nbsp;  Client Site Id:   Branch Id:   Project Id:  <BR></FONT>These ranges enable you to filter the report, just as you would the actual Create PM Billings function. If you leave these fields blank, Billing information the Inspection Date(s) for all applicable clients will be within your security level will appear on your report. </P>
 <P><FONT style="font-weight:bold; " >Master Contract Id:</FONT><BR>If you wish to only report on billings for equipment assigned to a specific Master Contract enter the desired Id.</P>
 <P><FONT style="font-weight:bold; " >Invoice </FONT><FONT style="font-weight:bold; " >Id:<BR></FONT>By default, this field is set to = so that only billings that do not yet have an invoice generated will appear on the report. To report on predicted billings as well as those that have already been created, clear this field. </P>
 <H3>Report Format:</H3>
 <P>The report format mirrors the ‘checklist’ screen of the Start Create PM Billings Function, displaying the following fields for each billing: </P>
 <P>Billing Date: &nbsp;Bill Amount:  &nbsp;Site Name:   &nbsp;Site Id:&nbsp;<BR>&nbsp;&nbsp;Amount Earned:&nbsp;Invoice Description:&nbsp;Invoice Id: &nbsp;</P>
 <H3>Report Order:</H3>
 <P>Predicted Master Contract Billings (yet to be generated) will appear first in the report, followed by predicted PM Billings not associated with a Master Contract. If the Invoice Id was cleared so that actual PM Billings  would be included, Predicted Billings will appear first, and actual PM Billings will appear second.</P>
 <H2>9.10 Work Order Daily Edit</H2>
 <P>PM Invoice-type WOs will now be skipped by this function by default.&nbsp; In this release, the default Work Order Type filter has been changed to '~PreventiveMaint,PM Invoice’ so that Preventive Maintenance and PM Invoice work orders will be excluded.</P>
 <H2>9.11  Escalation Profiles</H2>
 <P><FONT style="font-weight:bold; " >Pagination</FONT><FONT style="font-weight:bold; " > of reports</FONT><FONT style="font-weight:bold; " >:</FONT> <BR>Since reports launched by the scheduled event manager from escalation profiles do not know which printer they will be sent to, the default length was being set to 60 lines per page – much too short for a portrait report. This release has been enhanced so that the scheduled report manager will look at the LinesPerPage= option in the applicable sys-report-reportfunctionid registry setting when calculating the lines per page. Typically, somewhere between 78 and 80 lines would be appropriate for a portrait report.</P>
 <H2>9.12 Tech Finder</H2>
 <P>Corrects display issue if the technician already assigned to the work order was selected.  Note, however, that if the technician is already assigned to this work order, the selected workorder will not necessarily as the first item. If the work order is not assigned the technician you selected, it always appears as the first item. Also corrects wheel mouse display issues in this viewer.</P>
 <H2>9.13 WO Schedule Report</H2>
 <P>This new report provides a five-day summary of the assigned work orders displayed on a specific Dispatch Board. Only WO’s that are assigned to a technician are listed (unassigned work orders are not listed).  The following report must be imported and made available to applicable users: RSCHDLERPT.rpt.</P>
 <H3>Report Input Fields:</H3>
 <P><FONT style="font-weight:bold; " >Begin Date:<BR></FONT>Dispatches for this date plus the next five days will be included on the report; this field is optional.</P>
 <P><FONT style="font-weight:bold; " >Board Id:<BR></FONT>Specify the Dispatch Board to be listed in the report; this field is required. </P>
 <P><FONT style="font-weight:bold; " >WO Type:<BR></FONT>This optional range may be used to filter on certain types of work orders. For example, to display only Service type work orders, you would enter Service in this range.</P>
 <P><FONT style="font-weight:bold; " >Report Format:</FONT></P>
 <P>This report is laid out in a similar fashion to the Day version of the Classic Dispatch Board: Technicians are listed along the left side, and days along the top. </P>
 <P>For each dispatch line, the following information is printed: Site Id: WO Id: WO Name.</P>
 <H1>10 Quote Master </H1>
 <H2>10.1 Quote Viewer</H2>
 <P>If a user added a new Scope line with a Revenue Adjustment Id, and then approved the Quote without pushing the Revenue Adjust button or saving it first, the Revenue Adjustment was not written to the Quote or Work Order.  Now, the user is asked whether or not to enter the Revenue Adjustment. This build also corrects a rounding error on management fee calculations, and prevents approved revenue adjustment lines from being deleted.  </P>
 <P>Jobs with Tax Status of unknown are now excluded from selection as lead work orders, and in the Quote Master Wizard. </P>
 <P><FONT style="font-weight:bold; " >Sales Tax Group</FONT><FONT style="font-weight:bold; " >:</FONT> <BR>In previous releases, the tax group in Quotemaster defaulted from the Client Site COP tab, regardless of whether a different one was specified in the lead work order's job.&nbsp;In this release, the defaulting works as follows:</P>

 <P style="margin-left:36.00pt;">If there is NO lead work order, or the Sales Tax Group in the lead wo's job was blank, Sales Tax Group defaults from the Client Site's COP tab.</P>
 <P>This build<FONT style="font-weight:bold; " > </FONT>corrects sporadic problem in recent releases where the selected radio button did not display correctly when the  record was saved. </P>
 <P>New ‘Imported from Quote’ fields have been added to the Labor, Inventory and Other lines of the Work Order record. These fields will be checked if the line was imported from QuoteMaster. A registry entry (see user notes 2.6)  may be implemented to deny all changes to lines imported lines. Note that the Insert/Copy Line functionality has been enhanced so that, when copying lines imported from Quote Master, the Imported From Quote, Computed, and Quote boxes will all be cleared.</P>
 <P><FONT style="font-weight:bold; " >Print Quote Button: <BR></FONT>The Report specified in the Quote viewer will now always be the one that is printed, assuming that a user-defined function of the same name exists.   This fixes the report launching mechanism (for example, by clicking the Print Quote button in Quote Master) to eliminate the ambiguity that occurs when two reports have nearly identical Id values (e.g., RQTEFRM and RQTEFRM1) and user-defined functions existed for both.</P>
 <P><FONT style="font-weight:bold; " >Sub Tab:<BR></FONT>If the Equipment specified on a Scope line references to a Service Provider Rate Schedule, then any Other Rate Id's specified on the Sub tab should default the Unit Cost values from the Equipment's Service Provider Rate Schedule table instead of the one referenced in the Vendor record. This corrects a problem where the system only referenced the Service Provider Rate Schedule in the Vendor (Sub) record entered on the Sub tab line.</P>
 <H2>10.2. Quote Master Wizard</H2>
 <P>If a WO fails to be generated, the software now displays a message box and write the errors as .txt files. The .txt files should be written to the directory defined by the dbreportfiles registry id.</P>
 <P>In PO’s generated from the Quote Master Wizard, the unit price and amount revenue is now set to 0.00 for Inventory and Material Lines. In addition, the extra flag is not set in POs generated by Quote Master for Inventory and Material lines. </P>
 <P>If SecurityOverrideFrom=job is enabled and a new  work order is generated, the work order’s security will match the security of the Job selected in the wizard. </P>
 <P>When updating the Work Order Tech tab, the Status specified in the Wizard will be used for the update. Previously, the status was always set to Quote Approved. </P>
 <P>The following registry option will default in a Tech log type status code to the wizard:</P>
 <P>Id: sys-viewer-vqte</P>
 <P>Contents/Additional Contents: ApprovalWizardDefaultTechStatus=(a valid workorder log type)</P>
 <P style="margin-left:36.00pt;">If this registry entry is not found the default will be 'quote approved'.</P>
 <P>In previous versions, problems posting the PO’s and WO’s could occur if the user switched tabs before the post was complete. The following changes have been made to prevent this from happening: </P>
 <P style="margin-left:36.00pt;">The software switches to the Scope tab when wizard starts;  the user cannot switch tabs during the post. </P>
 <P style="margin-left:36.00pt;">The purchase order’s PO extra flag is now set for non-fixed fee quotes. </P>
 <P style="margin-left:36.00pt;">If a PO fails to be generated, the software now displays a message box and write the errors as .txt files. The .txt files are written to the directory defined by the dbreportfiles registry id.</P>
 <P>This release corrects a problem where the Sales Tax Group on PO lines generated from Quote Master were not being set correctly. The sales tax group on PO detail lines now comes from the PO header (ultimately from the Vendor) if it is set, instead of coming from the Sales Tax Group on the Quote. Also, whatever tax type is listed on the Quote lines will now be written to the Purchase Order detail. </P>
 <P>Overrides to the default Job Cost Code and Billing Items made when the Wizard screens are now correctly written to the Work Order and Purchase Orders generated.</P>
 <P style="margin-left:36.00pt;"><FONT style="font-weight:bold; " >Note on Duplicate Lines for Multiple Options:<BR></FONT>If duplicate lines are entered for 2 options, they are both written to the same cost code / billing item (the first selected in the Quote Approval Wizard screen).  The criteria is type (Labor, inventory, material, other, subcontractor) and description. This functionality enables the consolidation of duplicate lines on purchase orders. </P>
 <P>The Escalation Profile Id field has been added to the first screen of the QuoteMaster wizard. It will be used by the system if a NEW work order is being generated by Quote Master (Export to New WO is selected). This field will not change the existing source work order. </P>
 <P style="margin-left:36.00pt;">This field defaults from the source work order (if referenced in the Quote header) or from the equipment record associated to the first approved scope.</P>
 <P style="margin-left:36.00pt;">The following registry may be used to make this a required field in QuoteMaster:</P>
 <P style="margin-left:36.00pt;">Registry Id: sys-viewer-vqte<BR>Contents: RequireProfile=true</P>
 <H3>10.2.1 Shipping Location</H3>
 <P>Warning Message:</P>
 <P>If the user changes the default Shipping Location on the last Wizard screen, the system always uses the Shipping Location selected on the first line. The follwing message will now be displayed if you select a different location for subsequent PO lines: “Warning: you have changed the default Shipping Location for one or more PO's. The Shipping Location for each PO will be set to the Shipping Location selected on the first line. Split shipments must be handled manually.”</P>
 <H1>11 Manufacturing</H1>
 <H2>11.1 Shop Orders</H2>
 <P>A new list option named ShopOrderByWorkOrderid has been added to the Shop Order list to support Material Requisitioning. In addition, the WO Id field has been added to the filtering options.</P>
 <P>If a Shop Order was created for material requisitioning, the normal posting routines will no longer take place when the Shop Order is closed.</P>
 <H2>11.2 Back Order Filling </H2>
 <P>Please contact your support representative if your firm uses Requisitioning. An adjustment must be made to IM history to enable the import of backfilled inventory into work orders if your data was enter with build 7.1.461.154 or earlier.</P>
 <P>The following validations are observed to ensure that inventory data is correctly maintained:  </P>
 <P>1. All BO-filling functions write Record Change Log entries for each Client Order and Shop Order that gets filled.</P>
 <P>2. Shop Order and Client Order viewers deny adds/edits if any of the BO-filling functions are running.</P>
 <P>3. No more than one user per database can be 'Processing Back Orders' at any moment in time. This pertains to View BackOrders, View BackOrders For Shop, View BackOrders Override and &nbsp; Start BackOrder Filling.</P>
 <H2>11.3 Client Order viewer</H2>
 <P>Edits to the Deposit Tab now result in the correct reversals to the original GL Entries. </P>
 <H3>Freight Charges  – CHANGE TO EXISTING BEHAVIOR </H3>
 <P>In previous versions, the code that prepares the COP Invoice looked to the APJ-GEN tab for the Freight Charge associated to a drop-ship order.&nbsp; Everything from the GEN tab was treated as freight.&nbsp; However, some customers may have a situation where they wish to record Sales Tax on the GEN tab which caused it to appear as freight on the COP invoice. </P>
 <P>The COP record has a setting for freight charges.&nbsp; It has three choices:</P>
 <P>1. Prepaid = pay the freight company, do not bill the customer.<BR>2. Collect = freight company collects freight charge during delivery.<BR>3. Prepay&amp;Add = pay the freight company and bill the customer.<BR><BR>In this build, the existing code has been adjusted so that the APJ-GEN tab is included as freight on the COP Invoice <FONT style="text-decoration:underline;" >when the freight choice is Prepay&amp;Add</FONT>.</P>
 <H2>11. 4  Release Recurring Client Orders</H2>
 <P>This function now posts to Inventory History using the Client Id and Name from the Client on the Site’s COP tab in the same fashion as a manually created Client Order. See your support rep for help with updating your existing data.  </P>
 <H2>11.5 Recurring Client Order Viewer</H2>
 <P>Validation has been added to the Recurring Client Order viewer such that, when selecting a Site, that the Client Site's Client Id field (on the COP tab) is completed.</P>

 <H1>12 Material Requisitioning (New Module)</H1>
 <H2>12.1 Overview</H2>
 <P>Work Order Required Resources may consist of Inventoried Materials (for which an Inventory Item record exists) and Miscellaneous Materials (for which no Inventory Item exists). </P>
 <P>Most Inventoried materials will be requisitioned from your main stocking location via a Stop Transfer Order. If these items are not currently on hand, a backorder situation will be generated.  From this point, a set of procedures are used to identify, purchase and receive these items. Work Orders whose items have been fully received will be released (changing their status from Waiting Parts to Waiting Service), and have their items transferred from the staging area to the Technician’s truck.  When the work order is completed, a usage wizard is invoked to move the required items that have actually be used onto the Work Order Material and Other tabs for costing and billing purposes.</P>
 <H3>12.1.1 Enabling Requisitioning</H3>

 <P><FONT style="font-family:'Tahoma'; " >This function should be run in order to generate the Shop Transfer Orders needed to move un-requisitioned stock (on the Require Resource tabs of Work Orders) from your Stocking to Staging Locations. If items are not available at the Stocking location, a BO condition will be generated. At this point, you may use the Reorder Advice Report to identify items that be purchased to relieve the back order. Alternate, you may use Start Generate Purchase Orders to create the PO’s so that these required items may be bought to stock. </FONT></P>
 <H3>Usage:</H3>
 <P><FONT style="font-family:'Tahoma'; " >After running this function: </FONT></P>
 <P style="margin-left:36.00pt;"><FONT style="font-family:'Tahoma'; " >1. The Transfer Ticket Report should be run: this printed document instructs the user to pull the stock from the stocking location to the staging location.</FONT></P>
 <P style="margin-left:36.00pt;"><FONT style="font-family:'Tahoma'; " >2. Record Transfer Tickets function should be run to tell SAM Pro that the materials are now available at the staging location.</FONT></P>

 <H2>12.5 Start Backorder Filling</H2>
 <H2>Purpose:</H2>
 <P>This new function enables the user to fill backorders for both Client and Shop orders at the same time. <BR>When this function is run, the system auto-fills the quantity allocated by cycling through each parent item and distributing the Quantity Available to the Quantity Allocated for as many child lines as possible.&nbsp; </P>
 <H2>Usage:</H2>
 <P>The following validations are observed to ensure that inventory data is correctly maintained:  </P>
 <P>1. All BO-filling functions write Record Change Log entries for each Client Order and Shop Order that gets filled.</P>
 <P>2. Shop Order and Client Order viewers deny adds/edits if any of the BO-filling functions are running.</P>
 <P>3. No more than one user per database can be 'Processing Back Orders' at any moment in time. This pertains to View BackOrders, View BackOrders For Shop, View BackOrders Override and &nbsp; Start BackOrder Filling.</P>
 <H3>Registry:</H3>
 <P>The OrderBy registry entry for this function (see user notes 7.5.3) defines the priority for purposes of allocating to the children.&nbsp; The system keeps track of the number of parent items that could not be completely filled and if the count exceeds zero, displays a prompt that states that &quot;X items have back orders that could not auto-filled&quot;.</P>
 <H2>Important Fields: Upper Section</H2>

 <H2>12.6 Start Release Work Orders</H2>
 <H2>Purpose:</H2>
 <P>If Required Resources are present on a Work Order generated by Create PM Work Orders or from New Call, the Technician Status (the Log Type Id on the Technician tab) will be set to Waiting Parts, regardless of the default settings for this type of technician. </P>
 <P>The purpose of this function is to find qualified Waiting Parts-type WOs that can be changed to Waiting Service (or Unacknowledged).&nbsp; SAM Pro looks at the status of the individual Technician lines when evaluating Work Orders, not the Work Order Escalation Status. Specifically, the Log Status on the Tech tab line is set to the default value for that kind of tech - either Waiting Service or Unacknowledged (as specified on the Technician Web Access tab) or via registry (sys-web-access). </P>
 <H2>Usage:</H2>
 <P>This function is design to be used as part of the Material Requisitioning process to alert technicians that that their parts are available for transfer from the stage area to their trucks with the Start Work Order (Tech) Material Pickup (see user notes 12.7). </P>

 <H2>12.7 Start Work Order (Tech) Material Pickup</H2>
 <H2>Purpose:</H2>
 <P>This new starter function is a part of Work Order Material Requisitioning. It enables the transfer of inventory from a STAGING Location to a TRUCK Location prior to starting a work order.  </P>
 <H2>Usage:</H2>
 <P>Typically, this function would be run after the Start Release Work Order (see user notes 12.6) function sets the Work Order Escalation Status from Waiting Parts to Waiting Service (or Unacknowledged).  An Inventory Adjustment Journal entry will be generated when this function is run. </P>
 <H2>Registry:</H2>
 <P>The system will pull the default Transfer From (staging) location from the MaterialRequisitionToLocation=<FONT style="font-style:italic; " >staginglocationid</FONT><FONT style="font-style:italic; " > </FONT>option of the sys-viewer-vshpordr registry entry. </P>
 <H2>Important Fields:</H2>

 <H2>12.8 New Call Materials Requisitioning / Required Resources Enhancement</H2>
 <P><IMG src="images/rr_off.gif" border=0 height=28 width=48 alt="images\rr_off.gif"><FONT style="font-family:'Tahoma'; " > </FONT><FONT style="font-family:'Tahoma'; " >If the WO Materials Requisitioning module is implemented in your system (and the </FONT><FONT style="font-family:'Tahoma'; " >sys-ffv-global-settings registry’s </FONT>UseWORequiredResources=true option is set), the Required Resources button will enabled on the New Call viewer’s side button bar. This button enables you to add required resources (inventory items and flat rates)  to the work order you are creating AFTER selecting the Site, Equipment and other fields but BEFORE clicking New Call’s Add button. </P>
 <P><IMG src="images/rr_on.gif" border=0 height=28 width=48 alt="images\rr_on.gif"> When the Required Resource button is toggled to On, the lower section of the New Call screen change to display the Flat Rate and Inventory tabs.</P>
 <P>When a work order created from New Call results in the creation of WO Required Resource entries, then the technician’s status is now forced to 'Waiting Parts', overriding any existing default logic.</P>
 <P class="Tab" style="background-color:#e5e5e5; border-top:1.50pt solid black;border-bottom:1.50pt solid black;border-left:1.50pt solid black;border-right:1.50pt solid black;">FlatRate Tab</P>

 <P>The software now applies security and branch overrides by Job to Purchase Orders generated by this function. </P>
 <P>When this button is clicked, the required resource wizard is launched to allow creation of PO’s for non-inventory items listed on the Required Resource tab. The user should complete both the Vendor and Location fields in the Wizard viewer so the Purchase Order will be correctly configured. </P>
 <P>This function skips inventory UNLESS a Vendor Id has been specified.&nbsp; This provides a means of creating POs for special order/pricing inventory. Note that the Start Material Requisitioning function must be used to generate Stock Transfer Orders for Inventory Lines that do not specify a Vendor. </P>
 <H2>12.10 Import Cost Wizard </H2>
 <P>When a new work order is generated from Quote Master, the Sales Rep Id from the Quote is now written to the new Work Order’s Sales Rep field. </P>
 <P>The Import Costs part of the invoicing process has been enhanced to enable you to select the requisitioned items that should be included on the work order, as well as to import costs entered on PO’s, Labor Journal and Job Journal entries. </P>
 <P>The registry setting to implement this feature is included in user note 12.3</P>
 <P> When the Import Costs button is clicked (or the work order is set to Invoice Ready and saved), a Wizard is invoked when the user clicks ‘Yes’ on the import Costs button. The user will be lead through a series of screens to select which items to import. </P>
 <P><FONT style="text-decoration:underline;" >For Requisitioned Inventory Items:</FONT></P>
 <P>By default, the Wizard lists all quantities that were requisitioned, flagged as ‘Do’. The user may uncheck the ‘Do’ box, or change the quantity used or billed. Note that in the Wizard, the Quantity Billed needs to be adjusted separately. The selected items will be added to the Inventory tab.</P>
 <P><FONT style="text-decoration:underline;" >Inventory Lines imported from PO’s:</FONT></P>
 <P>The Do box should be flagged for all PO Inventory lines that should be imported. Note that the billing information may be adjusted. Note that the Wizard will not allow you to change the actual quantity of Inventory imported from a PO.</P>
 <P><FONT style="text-decoration:underline;" >Labor Lines:</FONT></P>
 <P>The Do box should be flagged for all labor that should be imported. Note that the billing information may be adjusted. </P>
 <P><FONT style="text-decoration:underline;" >Other Lines:</FONT></P>
 <P>The Do box should be flagged for all Other that should be imported. Note that the billing information may be adjusted. </P>
 <H2>12.11 Quotemaster and Materials Requisition</H2>
 <P>If the registry option UseQuoteRequiredResources=true<FONT style="font-weight:bold; " > </FONT>is implemented in sys-ffv-global-settings, the system will use the following rules when generating work orders/po’s from Quotes:</P>
 <P style="margin-left:36.00pt;">If a Vendor is not specified in an Inventory or Subcontractor line, the regular Quotemaster processing will occur AND lines will be written to the Required Resource Tab.</P>
 <P style="margin-left:36.00pt;">If a Vendor is specified on the Inventory or Sub tabs, the applicable purchase orders will be created and these lines will NOT be written to the Required Resource tab. </P>
 <H2>12.12 Report Work Order Required Resources (RWRKORDRRQRDRSRCE.rpt)</H2>
 <P>This new report list items included on the required resource tab of work orders that are not on hold and have not been requisitioned (e.g., have either a shop order id or a po id on the line).</P>
 <H2>Report Range Screen</H2>
 <P>The input screen allows the user to order the report by either Work Order Id or Job Id, and to choose whether to include Inventory Items, Other Items, or Both on the report.  The user will enter an End Date for the report, which is compared against the Required By field on the Work Order Required Resource tab.</P>
 <P>Report Ranges enable the user to filter by Work Order Id, Job Id, and Work Order Type (note that Preventive Maintenance Work Orders are initially excluded by default).</P>
 <H2>Report Contents:</H2>
 <P>The report itself lists the following fields: </P>
 <P style="margin-left:36.00pt;">Job Id - Job Name</P>
 <P style="margin-left:36.00pt;">Work Order Id – Type</P>
 <P style="margin-left:36.00pt;">Required Resource Id – Description – Quantity - Date Required</P>
 <H2>13 TechAnywhere – Tablet / PC</H2>
 <H2>13.1 Tech Status Posts</H2>
 <P>The TechAnywhere Post now sets the Client Site Equipment Status Field for New Equipment Created In TechAnywhere.</P>
 <P>The software now correctly handles ‘Index out of bounds’ posting errors. </P>
 <P>The TechAnywhere client now overrides the status changes on a work order if the work order was dispatched to the technician (and the dispatcher hasn't changed the status to cancelled). For example a TechAnywhere tech receives a work order and changes the status to onsite. Now, the dispatcher accidentally changes the status to travel. At this point, SAM Pro and TechAnywhere software are out of sync and the posting from TechAnywhere would fail. </P>
 <P>With this enhancement, when the tech goes to set the work order to complete (or another status) the technician's status now overrides the status that the dispatcher set in SAM Pro and re-synchronizes the software. Note that the only case where the dispatcher’s status overrides the technician’s is for ‘cancelled.’ </P>
 <P>Uploaded collateral was previously attached to the Site, Equipment and Work Order. Now, if the Document Category equals 'Receipt' or 'Invoice', these documents will only be attached to the Work Order.</P>
 <H2>13.2 COD Enhancements (TechAnywhere)</H2>
 <P>The AR Sales entry posted to JCH from TechAnywhere COD Invoices now includes the Work Order Id.</P>
 <P>Charges entered in TechAnywhere are now posted into Job History with a reference to the appropriate Invoice Id when processing COD-type work orders.</P>

 <H2>14.1 Report Enhancements</H2>
 <H3>14.1.1 Service History Report Enhancement</H3>
 <P>The web CRMAnywhere Service History Report has been enhanced so that the equipment that appears on the report may be selected, and a custom date range may be specified. </P>
 <P><FONT style="font-weight:bold; " >Setup Information:<BR></FONT>To implement the new functionality, the zipped file WebCalendarCode.zip needs to be unzipped to the SAMPro folder specified by the web-settings registry’s web-dir= option. </P>

 <P><FONT style="font-weight:bold; " >CRMAnywhere Service History Report Page</FONT></P>
 <P><FONT style="font-weight:bold; " >New Field: Equipment Id:<BR></FONT>An Equipment Id drop down box has been added to the Service History Report range screen; it will initially be set to &quot;ALL&quot;  so that all active equipment will be included on the report. To limit the report to a specific item, you may select it from the list of Id’s. </P>
 <P><FONT style="font-weight:bold; " >Date Range:<BR></FONT>A new option, &quot;Custom Date Range&quot; has been added to the date range drop down for the Service History Report.&nbsp; If this is selected,  two fields for start and end dates will be added to the right of the drop down.&nbsp; The way to set their values is through a pop up calendar.&nbsp; If both values are present in the fields, they will be used for the date range of the report.&nbsp; A message to fill both fields will be alerted to the user if only one field has a value.&nbsp; If the &quot;Custom Date Range&quot; entry is deselected, the two fields will disappear and the selected date range will be used as per normal.</P>
 <H3>14.1.2 Report Client Site Equipment</H3>
 <P>This report is used in SAM Pro and CRMAnywhere. Improvements to its formatting have been made so that it will display and print cleanly in the PDF format that CRMAnywhere users see. Contact your support representative for an updated version of this report. </P>
 <H2>14.1.3 Print Quote</H2>
 <P>The new CRMAnywhere print quote code now behaves like the Quote viewer (see user  note 10.1) except in cases where the Quote doesn't include a Report Id or when the Report Id links to a report produced outside of SAMPRO.&nbsp; In each of those cases, the user-defined function 'RQTEFRM' is executed  to print Quote Form 1.&nbsp; If RQTEFRM doesn't exist as a user-defined function, then the user sees an error message ... &quot;The function entry was not found for this report.&quot;.</P>
 <H2>14.2 Site View Page</H2>
 <P>If the registry option disablecrmmanagequotes=true is implemented in web-settings or in the registry tab of the Web Profile or Web User, the Site View page no longer includes the open quote table.<FONT style="font-weight:bold; " > </FONT>Please note that the values from 'web-settings' are loaded when the service is started: if you change the registry, you will need to restart the web server to see the results. </P>
 <H2>14.3 Completed Work Order Page</H2>

 <P><FONT style="font-weight:bold; " >New Call:</FONT> call sequencing is now disabled when no tech has been assigned when a work order is created in New Call. This is to prevent an overflow error that could occur if 999 or more unassigned pm’s were created, and then a new assigned work order was generated in New Call, when previously forced the sequencing. </P>
 <P><FONT style="font-weight:bold; " >Branch Filtering – Service Invoice:</FONT> this enhancement applies the hard-block on a User's Branch Filter to service invoicing so that a user cannot produce service invoices for WOs not included in the user's branch filter definition. </P>
