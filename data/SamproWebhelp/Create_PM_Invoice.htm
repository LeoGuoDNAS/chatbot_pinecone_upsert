  <h1>Create PM Billing</h1>
  <h2>Purpose:</h2>
  <p>If you prepare regular billings for your PM work regardless of when it is performed, you will set up that schedule in the PM Billing tab of the Client Site record or via Master Contracts. Running this function :</p>
  <p style="margin-left: 48px;">Generates these PM Invoices as Work Orders of Type &#39;PM Invoice&#39; for Service Compute Jobs.<br/>
    PM Invoice Work Orders will NOT have the Equipment tab completed or a Tech Id specified on the Tech or Log Tabs.<br/>
    The Invoice number will be added on the Client Site PM Invoice tab.</p>
  <p style="margin-left: 8px;"><span style="font-weight: bold;">These PM Invoices must then be printed and posted as usual!</span></p>
  <p>When this function is run, the Computed Thru date in the PM Job record specified in the Client Site will also be set to the Bill Date specified to ensure that future billings for this Job are computed correctly. A checklist (discussed below) enables you to confirm which billings will actually be generated.</p>
  <p style="font-weight: bold; margin-left: 48px;">PM Billing Spreadsheet With Results of Function<br/>
    <span style="font-weight: normal;">When this function is run, a .cvs file listing the results is created. <a class="dropspot" data-rhwidget="DropSpot" data-target="POPUP495282902" href="#"><span data-open-text="true" data-skip-index="true">Click for details.</span><span data-close-text="true">Click for details.</span></a></span>
  </p>
  <div data-targetname="POPUP495282902">
    <p>The .csv file will be written into the directory specified by the
      dbreportfiles registry option. It will list the following information:</p>
    <p>Bill Date - Amount Billed - Amount Earned - Site Name - Site Id
      - Invoice Description - Invoice Id</p>
    <p>Billing entries that include only the amortization of the revenue
      are listed at the beginning of the report, and will be indicated as
      such.</p>
  </div>
  <h2>Usage:  </h2>
  <p>The WO-COD GL Entity (for automatic credit card transactions) will default from the Job&#39;s GL Entities (the Job&#39;s GL A/R Entity first, then the Job&#39;s primary GL Entity). In earlier releases it was autoloaded from the Cost Code.</p>
  <p>When the UseMasterContractEquipmentTable global registry set to true, this process uses the new database Function to interpret Master Contract definitions.</p>
  <p>Validation prevents multiple users from updating the same records with this function.</p>
  
  <p>Common lines will be included on a single PM Invoice so that taxable and non-taxable components can be handled appropriately. <a class="dropspot" data-rhwidget="DropSpot" data-target="POPUP495465171" href="#"><span data-open-text="true" data-skip-index="true">Click for details and a registry to disable.</span><span data-close-text="true">Click for details and a registry to disable.</span></a></p>
  <div data-targetname="POPUP495465171">
    <p>A registry option (see <a href="Registry_Create_PM_Billing_Work_Order_Invoice.htm">Registry
        Start Create PM Billing</a>) may be used to disable this default behavior.
       Lines are considered &#39;common&#39; when <span id="BugEvents281">they
        have the same values for these fields:</span></p>
    <p style="margin-left: 48px;"><span>Client Site Id, Billing Schedule
        Date, Job Id, Cost Code, Billing Item, Payment Alias, Master Contract</span></p>
    <p style="margin-left: 8px;">This allows PM Billing lines with different
      Job Cost Categories to appear on the same PM Work Order Invoice with
      both taxable and non-taxable components. This functionality is currently
      supported on the Client Site PM Billing schedule (click the Magnify
      button to access the Cost Category field) and from Master Contract.</p>
  </div>
  <p><a class="dropspot" data-rhwidget="DropSpot" data-target="POPUP495808653" href="#"><span data-open-text="true" data-skip-index="true">Click for details on printing/posting PM Invoice Work Orders via Service Compute.</span><span data-close-text="true">Click for details on printing/posting PM Invoice Work Orders via Service Compute.</span></a></p>
  <div data-targetname="POPUP495808653">
    <p>
      <font style="font-weight: bold; text-decoration: underline; ">PM
        Invoice Work Orders<br/>
      </font> This functionality enables &quot;service&quot; jobs to be used
      on the Client Site Billing Schedule.  When this is done
      a &quot;PM Invoice&quot; type W.O. will be created when the Create
      PM Billings function is run. This Work Order will include all settings
      necessary for immediate billing via &quot;Start Compute Service Invoices&quot;...this
      allows you to have ALL service billing running through the same process
      and report, rather than using the &quot;Service Invoice&quot; for
      service jobs and Record Billing Adjustments for PM jobs.
    </p>
    <p>To implement this,</p>
    <p style="margin-left: 36.00pt;">The registry described in <a href="Registry_Create_PM_Billing_Work_Order_Invoice.htm">Registry
        Create PM Billing Work Order Invoice</a> must be created</p>
    <p class="Reference_Line" style="margin-left: 36.00pt; margin-bottom: 0.00pt;">The
      Client Site PM Billing tab must reference Jobs flagged as Service
      Compute.</p>
    <p>When Create PM Billings is run for Jobs that are flagged as Service
      Compute, and the appropriate registry entry has been made, the system
      will generate a PM Invoice Work Order. This Work Order will be set
      to Invoice Ready, with an invoice amount on the Revenue Adjustment
      tab corresponding to the Bill Amount on the Client Site PM Schedule
      line. Once this Work Order has been generated, it will be billed and
      posted via the Start Compute Service Invoice function.</p>
    <p style="margin-left: 36.00pt;">
      <font style="font-weight: bold;">Note
        on Accruals:</font><br/>
      When accruals are being performed the invoice that is generated needs
      to credit a liability account rather than Income since the Income
      was recognized in advance of the invoice being generated.  The
      Revenue Adjustments Tab does support setting this account directly.  This
      offers enhanced flexibility that is required to handle both earn as
      you go, and accrual recognition for scheduled PM Billings. 
    </p>
  </div>
  <p style="margin-left: 8px;">This function is sensitive to the status of the Site and the Job Date Closed:</p>
  <p style="margin-left: 48px;">1. If the Site is not Active or Credit Hold, do not create a PM Billing entry for it. In Version 9.0 and above,  this validation is refined so that Site with a future Date Closed will not be skipped when this function is run, even if it is flagged as Inactive.<br/>
    2. If the Job&#39;s Date Closed that precedes the Billing Date, do not create an Invoice for it.<br/>
    3. If the Job’s Tax Status is set to Unknown, it will be excluded from the list of eligible billings and added to the list of failed jobs.</p>
  <h2>Registry:</h2>
  <p>The invoice&#39;s security may be set by the Job&#39;s Security and/or Branch instead of the user’s. See <a href="Registry_Entry_Global_Settings__Column_Compression__Dispatch_Board_Rows__History_Log_Inventory_Markup.htm#Global_Settings_Security_Override">Global Settings Security Override</a> and <a href="Registry_Entry_Global_Settings__Column_Compression__Dispatch_Board_Rows__History_Log_Inventory_Markup.htm#Global_Settings_Branch_Override">Global Settings Branch Override</a> for details.</p>

  </p>
  <h3>Important Updates:</h3>
  <p>Previously, when a Credit Card alias would be declined, the system stopped and threw a message/error at every entry that was declined. When this happened, users would have to select OK on two separate messages. This caused a halt when users were mass batches were processed. In version 9.1.611.062 and above, the error messages are suppressed from displaying as a window as they error, and a document is produced at the end of the batch with a list of failures, their IDs, and the error message so they can be addressed.</p>
