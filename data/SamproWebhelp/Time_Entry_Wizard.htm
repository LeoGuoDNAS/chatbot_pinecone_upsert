<h1>Time Entry Wizard</h1>
<h2>Purpose:</h2>
<p>The Time Entry Wizard allows labor that is being charged to a work order to be entered in a user-friendly start time and end time basis and have the system work out the details of regular, overtime and doubletime labor and pay rates rates. When time is posted from the Wizard to the Work Order, the system automatically calculates straight time, time and a half (o/t) and double time for both pay and bill hours based on a shift definition defined in the Technician record and regular time billing period defined in the Work Order’s Job record.</p>
<h2>Usage:</h2>
<p>A customization file is required to run this module.</p>
<h2>Setup:</h2>
<p>Job Record:</p>
<p>Customization - New Fields on Job Invoicing Tab:</p>
<p><font style="font-weight: bold;">Regular Billing Start Time:<br/>
Regular Billing End Time:</font><br/>
These fields default what are considered regular hours for this job for week days that are not defined as holidays on the calendar. The Wizard will use the applicable Labor Rate (Regular, Overtime, Doubletime and Travel Regular, Overtime and Doubletime) on the Technician Defaults tab for Billing based on these hours.</p>
<p><font style="font-weight: bold;">Saturday Included:<br/>
Sunday Included:<br/></font>Checking these boxes enables Saturday and/or Sunday work to be defined as Regular Billing when determining the Labor Rate to use.</p>
<p>Technician Record: Defaults Tab</p>
<p><font style="font-weight: bold;">Start Time:<br/>
Quit Time:<br/></font>These fields provide the shift information for regular time for this Technician which Pay Type to use (Pay Type Id:, Overtime, or Doubletime).</p>
<p>Customization –</p>
<p>New Fields on Technician Defaults Tab:<br/>
 Labor Rate Id’s for Travel Time:<br/>
 Regular:<br/>
 Overtime:<br/>
 Doubletime:</p>
<p>These fields are used for defaulting Travel Labor Rate Ids for regular, overtime and double time for the Time Entry wizard. Note that the Labor Rates for work hours (for Regular, Overtime and Doubletime) must also be completed on this tab.</p>
<p>Registry:</p>
<p><font style="font-weight: bold;"> Id:</font> <font style="font-style: italic;">yourcompany</font>-<font style="font-weight: bold;">calendar</font></p>
<p><font style="font-weight: bold;">Setting Key:</font> date in yyyy-mm-dd</p>
<p><font style="font-weight: bold;">Setting Value:</font> Name of Holiday</p>
<p>The holidays defined by this registry will be considered double time pay days by the Technician Time Entry Wizard.</p>
<p>Example: Setting Key: 2010-12-25 Setting Value: Christmas</p>
<p>Labor Rate Record:</p>
<p>The Job Cost Category field should be completed for Labor Rates used for Technician Time Entry.</p>
<p>Payroll Period:</p>
<p>A default Payroll Period must be specified. The Technician Time Entry Wizard will ONLY post time to the work order if the effective day falls within the Default Payroll Period.</p>
<h2>Running the Time Entry Wizard:</h2>
<p><img src="assets/images/image/entertime.gif" alt="image\entertime.gif" title="image\entertime.gif" width="48" height="28" border="0"/> The Technician Time Entry Wizard is launched by clicking the Enter Time button on the Work Order’s Main tab (requires a special v.cus file). The following fields should be completed on the wizard:</p>
<p><font style="font-weight: bold;">Date Worked:<br/></font> The day the work or travel was performed: this must fall within the date range of the default Payroll Period to be entered in the Wizard.</p>
<p><font style="font-weight: bold;">Start Time: End Time:<br/></font>The Start and End Time (entered in military time) worked or traveled.</p>
<p><font style="font-weight: bold;">Technician:<br/></font>The Technician whose time you are entered; you may double-click to select from a list of Technicians assigned to this Work Order. Note that although you may type in the Id of a Technician that is not assigned to the Work Order, the post will fail if the Technician Id is not entered correctly.</p>
<p><font style="font-weight: bold;">Client Site Equipment Id:<br/></font>The Equipment the Technician worked on; you may double-click to select from a list of Equipment listed on this Work Order. Note that the Wizard will not let you enter an Equipment Id that is not listed on the Work Order’s Equipment tab.</p>
<p><font style="font-weight: bold;">Travel?<br/></font>Check this box (by double-clicking or pressing the Spacebar when the caret is on it) if you are entering Travel time on this line.</p>
<p><font style="font-weight: bold;">Shift Override?<br/></font>Check this box (by double-clicking or pressing the Spacebar when the caret is on it) if the work or travel time you entered should be handled as Regular Time (work or travel), regardless of the Start and End Times that are set in the Job record.</p>
<p>Buttons:</p>
<p>Cancel: click the Cancel button to cancel out of the Wizard without posting any lines to the Work Order.</p>
<p>Remove Line: click this button to clear the selected line. Any fields that defaulted in will do so again.</p>
<p>Finish: When you click this button, the lines that you entered will be added to the Work Order Labor tab, provided that no errors were found. If necessary, the system will automatically create as many work and travel lines as needed in the Work Order based on</p>
<p>The Date, Start and End Times you entered</p>
<p>Whether you flagged lines as Travel or Shift Override</p>
<p>The Information in the Job (Regular Billing Start and End Times, Include Saturday / Sunday)</p>
<p>The Start / End Time in the Technician Record</p>
<p>The Company Calendar holiday information (based on the Registry entry)</p>
<p><font style="font-weight: bold;">Important:</font> You must SAVE the Work Order to retain the lines that you posted to the Labor tab from the Technician Time Entry wizard.</p>
<h2>Technical Details:</h2>
<p>When above information is entered in the wizard, the system will calculate regular, overtime and double time pay and bill hours based the following rules and write to the Labor tab of the work order:</p>
<p>Any hours worked before the Technician Start Time or after the Technician End Time defined in the Technician record will be considered overtime pay and default the calculated hours and Technician Overtime Pay Type Id found in the Technician record and other entered information to the Labor entry screen on the Work Order.</p>
<p>Any hours worked before the Regular Billing Start Time or after the Regular Billing End Time found in the Job referenced in the Work Order will be considered overtime billing and default the calculated hours and the Technician Overtime Labor Rate Id found in the Technician record along with other entered information to the Labor entry screen on the Work Order.</p>
<p>If any of the hours worked are on Saturday, they will be considered overtime pay and overtime bill unless the referenced Job has the &quot;Saturday Included&quot; box checked which will then calculate overtime pay but regular time bill if hours are within Reg. Billing Start/End times defined in Job record. If any of the hours worked are on Sunday, they will be considered overtime pay and overtime bill unless the referenced Job has the &quot;Sunday Included&quot; box checked which will then calculate overtime pay but regular time bill if hours are within Reg. Billing Start/End times defined in the Job record.</p>
<p>If any of the hours worked are on a defined company holiday or a Sunday, they will be considered double time pay and double time bill hours.</p>
<p>If Travel check box is marked, default the appropriate Travel Labor Rate Id from Technician Record.</p>
<p>If Shift Override check box is marked, treat hours worked as regular time.</p>
